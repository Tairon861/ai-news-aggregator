&lt;p&gt;“It’s vital that we build the ecosystem, not just the AI infrastructure, of Korea,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO unveiled a sweeping initiative to build out South Korea’s AI ecosystem and infrastructure — a national-scale deployment of GPUs across sovereign clouds and industrial AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement marks one of the largest national investments in agentic and physical AI to date, and it’s backed by a coalition of Korea’s top organizations: the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Samsung Electronics, SK Group, Hyundai Motor Group, NAVER Cloud, LG and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort also comes as world leaders, including President Trump and President Xi, are among 21 APEC nations — the U.S., China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Vietnam, Singapore and others — gathered nearby for a separate APEC Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celebrating 25 Years of GeForce in Korea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86974" height="640" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ggf25-generic-PM104055-960x640.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news is a continuation of NVIDIA’s decades-long history of building a rich ecosystem with Korea. The country has played an outsized role as a nation that spearheaded esports and helped drive the PC-bang boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindling that tradition, NVIDIA celebrated GeForce’s 25-year run in Korea with a GeForce Gamer Festival&amp;nbsp;in Seoul this week. The festival featured the latest GeForce RTX technology, with NCSOFT giving attendees an exclusive hands-on with unreleased games &lt;i&gt;AION 2&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;CINDER CITY&lt;/i&gt;, both featuring NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KRAFTON showcased &lt;i&gt;PUBG Ally&lt;/i&gt;, an AI co-playable character powered by NVIDIA ACE, for its global hit &lt;i&gt;PUBG:Battlegrounds&lt;/i&gt;. There were also giveaways, live esports matches including a special &lt;i&gt;StarCraft&lt;/i&gt; match between legendary pro gamers Hong Jin-ho (YellOw) and Lee Yoon-yeol (NaDa), and performances by renowned taekwondo group K-TIGERS and international K-POP sensation LE SSERAFIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea, with a heritage of rapid technology-driven progress, is taking the next big step with its AI industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the effort is a sovereign AI infrastructure program led by MSIT, which will deploy as many as 50,000 of the latest NVIDIA GPUs through cloud providers NHN Cloud, Kakao Corp. and NAVER Cloud. The initial wave includes 13,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, with more to follow in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building AI Factories: Korea’s Industrial Titans&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of private-sector investment is staggering. Samsung, SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group are each building AI factories with up to 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs apiece, while NAVER plans to deploy more than 60,000. This is forming the backbone for Korea’s AI-powered transformation across manufacturing, mobility, telecommunications and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Samsung&lt;/b&gt; is using NVIDIA CUDA-X, cuLitho, Nemotron models and Omniverse to build digital twins for semiconductor manufacturing, while advancing its robotics portfolio with NVIDIA Cosmos and Isaac GR00T.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SK Group&lt;/b&gt; is designing an AI factory capable of hosting up to 60,000 GPUs, including an AI cloud powered by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. SK Telecom will offer sovereign infrastructure for domestic manufacturers and startups to build digital twins and robotics applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hyundai Motor Group&lt;/b&gt; is collaborating with the Korean government and NVIDIA to build an NVIDIA AI factory with 50,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to enable AI model training, validations and deployment for manufacturing, autonomous driving and robotics. The company plans to use NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, NeMo, Nemotron and Omniverse to simulate factory operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;NAVER&lt;/b&gt; is adding another 60,000 GPUs to its NVIDIA AI infrastructure, targeting sovereign and physical AI workloads. It plans to develop industry-specific models for shipbuilding, security and AI services for Korean citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Korean Language Models and Quantum Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Korean government is also investing in foundational AI research. MSIT is leading a Sovereign AI Foundation Models project in collaboration with LG AI Research, NAVER Cloud, NC AI, SK Telecom, Upstage and NVIDIA. The initiative will use NVIDIA NeMo software and open NVIDIA Nemotron datasets, tapping local data to develop Korean language models with reasoning and speech capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA and LG are collaborating to support academia and startups with LG’s EXAONE models, including the EXAONE Path healthcare model — built with the MONAI framework — to support cancer diagnosis. The company is also working with NVIDIA to support physical AI startups and academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) is partnering with NVIDIA to establish a Center of Excellence for quantum computing and scientific research. Using its sixth-generation HANGANG supercomputer and the NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, KISTI will explore hybrid quantum computing, physics-informed AI models and scientific foundation models built with the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI-RAN and 6G: The Next Frontier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move to drive next-generation mobile networks, NVIDIA is collaborating with Samsung, SK Telecom, ETRI, KT, LGU+ and Yonsei University to develop AI-RAN and 6G infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intelligent, low-power network technology offloads GPU computation from devices to base stations, reducing energy costs and extending battery life — a critical enabler for widespread robotics adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fostering Innovation With Startups and Training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support Korea’s next generation of AI companies, NVIDIA is expanding the NVIDIA Inception program with a new startup alliance. Members will gain access to accelerated computing infrastructure from partners like SK Telecom, along with support from VC firms including IMM Investment, Korea Investment Partners and SBVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Center of Excellence powered by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs will help startups build physical AI applications, while the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute will offer AI upskilling programs to train Korea’s future workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rewiring a Nation for Artificial Intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale and ambition of Korea’s AI initiative is nearly unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about deploying GPUs. It’s about rewiring a nation’s industrial base for intelligence. From sovereign clouds to quantum labs, autonomous factories and AI agents — Korea is building the infrastructure of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;notice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; regarding software product information.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After generating over 10 million social media impressions with the launch of its text-to-3D model app, the AI startup had its pick of investors. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We were getting term sheets over email without any meetings,” said CEO Zach Dive (on the right in the picture above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adam quickly went with TQ Ventures as its lead investor because they agreed on the future of computer-aided design (CAD). Just as importantly, they also agreed on Adam’s roadmap — going consumer first, and then to enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This required the most alignment: Adam caught people’s attention with a mainstream product, not an enterprise one. But Dive said this choice is paying off and paving the way for Adam’s upcoming copilot for professional-grade CAD workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup had always planned to go B2B but felt that the technology wasn’t enterprise-ready yet — which is why it initially focused on makers, not engineers. But AI models improved faster than they expected, and Adam now plans to launch its copilot by the end of the year, Dive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its initial tool lets creators without CAD skills create 3D models from text prompts, but early feedback showed that text wasn’t always the best way to interact with 3D, Dive said. “So for our copilot, we blended in different interaction paradigms; for example, users selecting different parts of the 3D object and conversing with it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This will give the startup an element of differentiation compared to other text-to-CAD products, although there is already competition in the “AI copilot for CAD” segment as well. MecAgent, for instance, is already available, but Adam could capitalize on its viral launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Early momentum particularly helped with hiring, which is still an ongoing effort, Dive said. He and his co-founder, Adam CPO Aaron Li, both graduated from UC Berkeley’s Master of Design program, but the startup also needs more AI and engineering talent to “give models the right context for reasoning in space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Capital and endorsements can both help with this endeavor, and Adam now has its fair share of both, sometimes combined. Besides TQ and participating funds 468 Capital, Pioneer, Script Capital, and Transpose Platform, Adam is also backed by angel investors, including Tim Glaser (PostHog), Trevor Blackwell (YC), and Theo Browne (T3 Chat).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch called Adam “the v0 of CAD” (in a nod to Vercel’s V0, an AI-powered platform for web creation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s simpler, faster, and reaches a broader audience,” he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adam is already on its way to reaching a broad audience, with “tens of thousands of individual users and a growing base of paying customers” for its standard and pro plans, which respectively start at $5.99 and $17.99 per month. The startup hasn’t begun to monetize its soon-to-launch enterprise offering, but has “testers validating different features,” Dive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This testing phase is clearly necessary: There’s quite a jump from helping amateurs print 3D Pikachus to supporting engineers in their daily work. Dive said the startup doesn’t intend to replace them, but instead streamlines time-consuming tasks such as applying the same change to multiple CAD files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an initial focus on mechanical engineering, the startup plans to help these pro users generate feature‑rich parametric designs in popular CAD programs, beginning with Onshape, which is known for bringing CAD to the cloud and reshaping workflows. “The same thing will be true with AI,” Dive predicted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Adam-cofounders-Aaron-Li-and-Zach-Dive.jpg?resize=1200,802" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adam, one of the most viral startups in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch, has raised a $4.1 million seed round to power its next steps, TechCrunch learned exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The comments were made this week during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One analyst on the call also asked Cook if Apple was still pursuing a three-pronged approach when it came to the development of its personalized AI — meaning a combination of in-house Apple foundation models, partnerships with third-party LLM providers, and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cook responded that Apple was still open to the latter, noting the company continually surveils the market on M&amp;amp;A and  is “open to pursuing M&amp;amp;A if we think that it will advance our roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a pre-earnings interview with CNBC, Cook noted that Apple was preparing to announce more AI partnerships like the one it has with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,” Cook told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the earnings call, Cook also talked about how Apple creates foundation models, ships them on devices, and uses them in Private Cloud Compute, its cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cook shared later in the call that Apple is already using its Private Cloud Compute technology for a number of Siri queries and is continuing to build out that infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we’ve got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. And, you know, it’s robust,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cook additionally suggested that AI was a factor in consumers’ decision-making process when it comes to selecting a new smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224174932.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled to investors the company is still open to acquisitions and partnerships to move things forward on the AI front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The comments were made this week during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. The exec also offered a brief update about Apple’s next-generation, AI-powered Siri, saying the service was still on track to launch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re making good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it next year,” Cook said during his opening remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

The majority of cameras can capture real-time footage, but struggle to interpret it. This is a problem turning into a growing concern for smart city designers, manufacturers and schools, each of which may depend on AI to keep people and property safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumana, an AI video surveillance company, believes the fault in these systems lies deep in the foundations of how they are built. “Traditional video platforms were created decades ago to record footage, not interpret it,” said Jordan Shou, Lumana’s Vice President of Marketing. “Adding AI on top of outdated infrastructure is like putting a smart chip in a rotary phone. It might function, but it will never be truly intelligent or reliable enough to understand what’s being captured or help teams make smarter real-time decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-big-consequences"&gt;Big consequences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traditional video security systems layer AI on older infrastructure, false alerts and performance issues arise. Alerts and missed detections are not just technical hiccups, but risks that can have devastating consequences. Shou points to a recent case where a school surveillance system, which used an AI add-on for gun detection, misidentified a harmless object for a weapon, setting off an unnecessary police response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every mistake, whether it’s a missed event or a false alert, which leads to improper response, erodes trust,” he said. “It wastes time, money, and can traumatise people who did nothing wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errors can also be costly. Each false alarm forces teams to pause real work and investigate, a process that can drain millions from public safety and operational budgets every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-smarter-foundation"&gt;Building a smarter foundation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of layering AI on top of old video security frameworks, Lumana rebuilt the infrastructure itself with an all-in-one platform that combines modern video security hardware, software, and proprietary AI. The company’s hybrid-cloud design connects any security camera to GPU-powered processors and adaptive AI models that operate at the edge – meaning they are located as close as possible to where the footage is captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, Shou says, is faster performance and more accurate analysis. Each camera becomes a continuous-learning device that improves over time, understanding motion, behaviour, and patterns unique to its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The issue is that most of today’s video surveillance systems use static, off-the-shelf AI models that were only designed to work in specific environments. AI shouldn’t need a perfect lab environment to work,” Shou explained. “It should work in real-world conditions and adapt based on the video data that’s coming in. That’s why, when customers compare Lumana to their existing or other AI systems, the difference and performance gaps are immediately clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s design also prioritises privacy. All data is encrypted, governed by access controls, and compliant with SOC 2, HIPAA, and NDAA standards. Customers can disable facial or biometric tracking if they choose. “Our focus is on actions, not identities,” Shou said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-use-cases"&gt;Real-world use cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumana’s systems have been deployed in several industries. One of its most visible projects is with JKK Pack, a 24-hour packaging manufacturer that uses security cameras to monitor safety and operational efficiency in its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Lumana’s deployment, cameras only recorded incidents for later review, which led to missed events and reactive incident response. After the upgrade, the same hardware could detect unsafe movements, equipment faults, or manufacturing bottlenecks in real-time. The company reported 90% faster investigations and alerts delivered in under a second which dramatically improved response to safety incidents, without replacing a single camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another deployment, a grocery retailer integrated Lumana’s AI into its existing camera network to flag unusual point-of-sale activity, like repeat voids, and to correlate those events with visual evidence. The system reduced shrinkage and improved employee accountability by providing real-world examples of policy violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond manufacturing, Lumana’s system has been used at large public events, in restaurants, and for municipal operations. In cities, it helps identify illegal dumping and fires; in quick-service chains, it monitors kitchen safety and food handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broader-push-for-reliable-ai-video-security"&gt;A broader push for reliable AI video security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumana’s work comes at a time when accuracy and accountability are replacing speed as the top priorities for enterprise AI. A recent study from F5 found that only 2% of companies consider themselves fully ready to scale AI, with governance and data security cited as the main challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That caution is reflected in the market, with analysts warning that as AI takes on more decision-making, systems must remain “auditable, transparent, and free from bias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumana’s architecture echoes the call for accountability, blending performance and control with data governance and cybersecurity in an easy-to-deploy solution that enhances existing security camera infrastructure, helping organisations extract immediate value from AI video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-next-step-in-machine-vision"&gt;The next step in machine vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shou said Lumana’s next stage of development aims to move from detection and understanding to predicting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next evolution of AI video will be about reasoning,” he said. “The ability to grasp context in real time, provide actionable and impactful insights from the video data collected, will change how we think about safety, operations, and awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lumana, the goal is not just teaching AI how to see better, but to help it understand what it is seeing and letting those who rely on that video data to make smarter, faster decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ON24-holding-slide-11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the progress in artificial intelligence, most video security systems still fail at recognising context in real-world conditions.

The deal marks a notable shift for the company, which has been hit by allegations of content scraping and plagiarism, and signals an effort to establish more formal content partnerships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity and Getty have been working together for more than a year, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. Though it was never announced, Getty was part of Perplexity’s Publishers’ Program, a plan to share ad revenue with publishers when their content surfaced in a search query, the source said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today’s agreement is a new deal. A source told TechCrunch it’s not a traditional lump sum licensing deal, since Perplexity doesn’t train its own foundational models, but would not elaborate on the terms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity’s agreement with Getty appears to legitimize some of the startup’s previous use of Getty’s stock photos. Perplexity has come under fire within the last year for a series of plagiarism accusations from several news organizations. In one case, the startup was called out for pulling content from a Wall Street Journal article, including the Getty photo in that piece. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, several outlets questioned whether Perplexity’s use of the images constituted copyright infringement. A source last year told TechCrunch that Perplexity was working on an agreement with Getty, but we were unable to confirm the deal after reaching out to the stock image giant several times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More recently, Reddit sued Perplexity in October, alleging “industrial-scale, unlawful” scraping of user content and circumventing technical measures to access data. Reddit has a data licensing agreement with OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity says its Getty deal will help it better display images and include credits with links back to the original source whenever images show up in search results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nick Unsworth, vice president of strategic development at Getty, said the agreement “acknowledges the importance of properly attributed consent and its value in enhancing AI-powered products.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand the world in an age of AI,” Jessica Chan, head of content and publisher partnerships at Perplexity, said in a statement. “Together, we’re helping people discover answers through powerful visual storytelling while ensuring they always know where that content comes from and who created it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity’s emphasis on attribution is part of its strategy of defending against copyright accusations by arguing its use of publisher content — including content behind a paywall or that publishers have explicitly indicated they don’t want scraped — constitutes “fair use” because publicly available facts are not copyrightable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/getty-perplexity.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images, which gives it  permission to display images from Getty across its AI-powered search and discovery tools.

The bad (and less common) news, however, is that AI is also making those conversations harder to control. From chat apps to collaboration tools, employees exchange thousands of messages every day, many of which now pass through AI systems that summarise, analyse, or even respond on their behalf. For enterprises, that creates a new kind of exposure: Communication data that is intelligent, unstructured, and often ungoverned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dima Gutzeit, CEO of business communications platform provider LeapXpert, believes the future of enterprise communication depends on solving this challenge. “AI has made conversation the most valuable dataset inside organisations,” he said. “But without structure and governance, that value quickly turns into risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-enterprise-communication-blind-spot"&gt;The enterprise communication blind spot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, corporate communications were treated as either static records – emails stored in archives – or ephemeral exchanges that disappeared after use. The rise of AI has changed that. Tools like Microsoft’s Copilot and Zoom’s AI Companion now interpret tone, context, and intent in real-time, turning chat history into searchable knowledge. But for many companies, that same intelligence is emerging in silos, without visibility or control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every enterprise is adopting AI somewhere in its communication stack,” Gutzeit said. “The problem is that few have a unified way to manage it in all channels, especially when client conversations happen on platforms like WhatsApp or iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That lack of oversight has real-world consequences with far-reaching impact. According to a 2025 Kiteworks survey, 83% of organisations admit they have limited visibility into how employees use AI tools at work, and nearly half have already experienced at least one AI-related data incident. The challenge here isn’t just data loss, but also accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-conversations-into-intelligence"&gt;Turning conversations into intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeapXpert’s platform aims to close that gap through what the company calls “Communication Data Intelligence”. The system captures and consolidates all external client communications, whether from WhatsApp, WeChat, iMessage, or Microsoft Teams, into a single, governed environment. In this framework, LeapXpert’s proprietary AI engine, Maxen analyses messages for sentiment, intent, and compliance signals, and maintains full auditability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that every conversation can be understood responsibly. Relationship managers, compliance officers, and legal teams can see the same transparent record of who said what, when, and why. The AI can also detect anomalies, flag potential policy violations, and generate summaries for faster reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it as bringing context to compliance,” Gutzeit said. “Our goal is not to replace human communication, but to make it smarter, safer, and accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-in-the-real-world"&gt;Results in the real world&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeapXpert backs its claims about its communications data intelligence concept with customer proofs from the field. In one such case, a North American investment management firm operating under SEC and FINRA oversight implemented the LeapXpert platform recently to consolidate its messaging systems. Before deployment, the compliance team manually sampled conversations from several archives – a process that consumed hours each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after integrating LeapXpert’s platform, all communications were consolidated into a single, auditable system, resulting in a 65% reduction in manual review time and an improvement in audit response times from days to hours. More importantly, the firm also gained real-time visibility into emerging conduct risks, while employees continued using the communications channels their clients preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutzeit said such results highlight the growing industry reality that regulated enterprises can no longer afford to separate innovation from compliance. “They have to move together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governing-the-ai-era-of-communication"&gt;Governing the AI era of communication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of embedded AI features in everyday tools adds another layer of urgency. Platforms like Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft Teams now include generative assistants that summarise messages or recommend actions; functions that may automatically process sensitive data. Without clear governance, these features can introduce the same risks that external tools once did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where Gutzeit says LeapXpert’s architecture stands apart. The platform operates on a zero-trust framework, encrypting every message in transit and at rest. Customers retain full data ownership through bring-your-own-key encryption, while AI operations run in secure, isolated environments. “Our systems are built so enterprises can benefit from AI without surrendering control of their data,” Gutzeit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-path-ahead"&gt;The path ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to permeate enterprise communication, Gutzeit expects governance to evolve from a defensive measure to a source of business intelligence. “We’re entering a phase where AI will understand communication, not just record it,” he said. “That means compliance officers and business leaders can both derive value from the same dataset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutzeit also sees it as the next logical step in the evolution of enterprise communication. “AI will only be transformative if it’s trusted,” he noted. “Transparency, auditability, and context are what make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises navigating the tension between innovation and oversight, LeapXpert offers the proposition of AI that listens, understands, and stays accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Header-image-LeapXpert-article-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no longer news that AI is transforming how people communicate at work. The bad (and less common) news, however, is that AI is also making those conversations harder to control. From chat apps to collaboration tools, employees exchange thousands of messages every day, many of which now pass through AI systems that summarise, analyse, or even respond on their behalf. For enterprises, that creates a new kind of exposure: Communication data that is intelligent, unstructured, and often ungoverned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dima Gutzeit, CEO of business communications platform provider LeapXpert, believes the future of enterprise communication depends on solving this challenge. “AI has made conversation the most valuable dataset inside organisations,” he said. “But without structure and governance, that value quickly turns into risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-enterprise-communication-blind-spot"&gt;The enterprise communication blind spot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, corporate communications were treated as either static records – emails stored in archives – or ephemeral exchanges that disappeared after use. The rise of AI has changed that. Tools like Microsoft’s Copilot and Zoom’s AI Companion now interpret tone, context, and intent in real-time, turning chat history into searchable knowledge. But for many companies, that same intelligence is emerging in silos, without visibility or control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every enterprise is adopting AI somewhere in its communication stack,” Gutzeit said. “The problem is that few have a unified way to manage it in all channels, especially when client conversations happen on platforms like WhatsApp or iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That lack of oversight has real-world consequences with far-reaching impact. According to a 2025 Kiteworks survey, 83% of organisations admit they have limited visibility into how employees use AI tools at work, and nearly half have already experienced at least one AI-related data incident. The challenge here isn’t just data loss, but also accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-conversations-into-intelligence"&gt;Turning conversations into intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeapXpert’s platform aims to close that gap through what the company calls “Communication Data Intelligence”. The system captures and consolidates all external client communications, whether from WhatsApp, WeChat, iMessage, or Microsoft Teams, into a single, governed environment. In this framework, LeapXpert’s proprietary AI engine, Maxen analyses messages for sentiment, intent, and compliance signals, and maintains full auditability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that every conversation can be understood responsibly. Relationship managers, compliance officers, and legal teams can see the same transparent record of who said what, when, and why. The AI can also detect anomalies, flag potential policy violations, and generate summaries for faster reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it as bringing context to compliance,” Gutzeit said. “Our goal is not to replace human communication, but to make it smarter, safer, and accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-in-the-real-world"&gt;Results in the real world&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeapXpert backs its claims about its communications data intelligence concept with customer proofs from the field. In one such case, a North American investment management firm operating under SEC and FINRA oversight implemented the LeapXpert platform recently to consolidate its messaging systems. Before deployment, the compliance team manually sampled conversations from several archives – a process that consumed hours each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after integrating LeapXpert’s platform, all communications were consolidated into a single, auditable system, resulting in a 65% reduction in manual review time and an improvement in audit response times from days to hours. More importantly, the firm also gained real-time visibility into emerging conduct risks, while employees continued using the communications channels their clients preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutzeit said such results highlight the growing industry reality that regulated enterprises can no longer afford to separate innovation from compliance. “They have to move together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-governing-the-ai-era-of-communication"&gt;Governing the AI era of communication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of embedded AI features in everyday tools adds another layer of urgency. Platforms like Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft Teams now include generative assistants that summarise messages or recommend actions; functions that may automatically process sensitive data. Without clear governance, these features can introduce the same risks that external tools once did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where Gutzeit says LeapXpert’s architecture stands apart. The platform operates on a zero-trust framework, encrypting every message in transit and at rest. Customers retain full data ownership through bring-your-own-key encryption, while AI operations run in secure, isolated environments. “Our systems are built so enterprises can benefit from AI without surrendering control of their data,” Gutzeit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-path-ahead"&gt;The path ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to permeate enterprise communication, Gutzeit expects governance to evolve from a defensive measure to a source of business intelligence. “We’re entering a phase where AI will understand communication, not just record it,” he said. “That means compliance officers and business leaders can both derive value from the same dataset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutzeit also sees it as the next logical step in the evolution of enterprise communication. “AI will only be transformative if it’s trusted,” he noted. “Transparency, auditability, and context are what make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises navigating the tension between innovation and oversight, LeapXpert offers the proposition of AI that listens, understands, and stays accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/how-leapxpert-uses-ai-to-bring-order-and-oversight-to-business-messaging/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:47:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AWS exceeds Wall Street’s expectations as demand for cloud infra remains high (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/aws-exceeds-wall-streets-expectations-as-demand-for-cloud-infra-remains-high/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_4752.jpg?resize=1200,797" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its third-quarter earnings release on Thursday. The business segment’s operating income increased to $11.4 billion in Q3, up from $10.4 billion at the same point in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY,” Andy Jassy, the president and CEO of Amazon, said in the company’s earnings announcement. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS launched an infrastructure region in New Zealand during the quarter and has three more regions in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The cloud infrastructure provider also secured several new deals in Q3 across a variety of industries, including a few notable names in the AI market. In July, AWS partnered with Perplexity to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’re going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing capacity because we see the demand,” Jassy said about investing in AI infrastructure. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-handles-over-a-million-suicide-related-conversations-weekly"&gt;ChatGPT handles over a million suicide-related conversations weekly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-working-on-ai-that-create-music-from-text-and-audio"&gt;OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-atlas-to-make-chatgpt-your-main-search-tool"&gt;OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-chatgpt-go-plan-to-16-more-asian-countries"&gt;OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-surpasses-800-million-weekly-active-users"&gt;ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-can-now-build-apps-inside-chatgpt"&gt;Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="september2025"&gt;September 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-chatgpt-pulse-for-personalized-morning-briefs"&gt;OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-budget-friendly-chatgpt-go-to-indonesian-users"&gt;OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2191707579.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-handles-over-a-million-suicide-related-conversations-weekly"&gt;ChatGPT handles over a million suicide-related conversations weekly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-working-on-ai-that-create-music-from-text-and-audio"&gt;OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-atlas-to-make-chatgpt-your-main-search-tool"&gt;OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-chatgpt-go-plan-to-16-more-asian-countries"&gt;OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-surpasses-800-million-weekly-active-users"&gt;ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-can-now-build-apps-inside-chatgpt"&gt;Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="september2025"&gt;September 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-chatgpt-pulse-for-personalized-morning-briefs"&gt;OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-budget-friendly-chatgpt-go-to-indonesian-users"&gt;OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They did so following a vote-no recommendation from their largest shareholder, Sina Toussi of Two Seas Capital, a firm that focuses on post-bankruptcy companies.&amp;nbsp;Core Scientific emerged from its bankruptcy in January 2024. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Core Scientific, which began as a crypto miner and still is one, shares that early history with AI data center provider CoreWeave, which also started as a miner. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But CoreWeave, with investor and partner Nvidia, has now transitioned to serving AI workloads. From its IPO until now, its stock has soared from a $14 billion market cap to $66 billion today (about $140 per share) as investors view it as a way to get in on the AI action. It has been spending those shares on acquisitions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CoreWeave had already signed a $10 billion, 12-year contract with Core Scientific to use its facilities for AI services, even as it nailed down a deal announced in July to buy the company outright. The offer was a premium to Core Scientific’s share price at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But investor Toussi thinks Core Scientific can turn into another CoreWeave on its own.  “Since the transaction was announced in July, investment in AI infrastructure has accelerated, driving equity valuations of Core Scientific’s peers to ever-greater heights,” he wrote in his opposition letter. “Why would anyone vote for a transaction worth a mere $16.40 per share?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So investors turned down the deal and CoreWeave walked. Core Scientific’s stock rose on the news, and the company is now trading at a $6.6 billion market cap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Investors turning down acquisition bids in pursuit of bigger offers is another sign that we’re in — or at least headed for — an AI bubble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, CoreWeave is still shopping. On Thursday, it turned around and acquired Marimo, an&amp;nbsp;open source Jupyter Notebook competitor, for an undisclosed sum. PitchBook estimates Marimo has raised about $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Python notebooks are dev tools that combine code, rich media, and explanatory text into a single, shareable file.

The goal would be to prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Preventive was founded by the gene-editing scientist Lucas Harrington, who described his plans yesterday in a blog post announcing the venture. Preventive, he said, will not rush to try out the technique but instead will dedicate itself “to rigorously researching whether heritable genome editing can be done safely and responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Creating genetically edited humans remains controversial, and the first scientist to do it, in China, was imprisoned for three years. The procedure remains illegal in many countries, including the US, and doubts surround its usefulness as a form of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

In theory, even small genetic tweaks could create people who never get heart disease or Alzheimer’s, and who would pass those traits on to their own offspring.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to Harrington, if the technique proves safe, it “could become one of the most important health technologies of our time.” He has estimated that editing an embryo would cost only about $5,000 and believes regulations could change in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Preventive is the third US startup this year to say it is pursuing technology to produce gene-edited babies. The first, Bootstrap Bio, based in California, is reportedly seeking seed funding and has an interest in enhancing intelligence. Another, Manhattan Genomics, is also in the formation stage but has not announced funding yet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As of now, none of these companies have significant staff or facilities, and they largely lack any credibility among mainstream gene-editing scientists. Reached by email, Fyodor Urnov, an expert in gene editing at the University of California, Berkeley, where Harrington studied, said he believes such ventures should not move forward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Urnov has been a pointed critic of the concept of heritable genome editing, calling it dangerous, misguided, and a distraction from the real benefits of gene editing to treat adults and children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his email, Urnov said the launch of still another venture into the area made him want to “howl with pain.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harrinton’s venture was incorporated in Delaware in May 2025,under the name Preventive Medicine PBC. As a public-benefit corporation, it is organized to put its public mission above profits. “If our research shows [heritable genome editing] cannot be done safely, that conclusion is equally valuable to the scientific community and society,” Harrington wrote in his post.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harrington is a cofounder of Mammoth Biosciences, a gene-editing company pursuing drugs for adults, and remains a board member there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent months, Preventive has sought endorsements from leading figures in genome editing, but according to its post, it had secured only one—from Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health Sciences University, who said she had agreed to act as an advisor to the company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amato is a member of a US team that has researched embryo editing in the country since 2017, and she has promoted the technology as a way to increase IVF success. That could be the case if editing could correct abnormal embryos, making more available for use in trying to create a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;It remains unclear where Preventive’s funding is coming from. Harrington said the $30 million was gathered from “private funders who share our commitment to pursuing this research responsibly.” But he declined to identify those investors other than SciFounders, a venture firm he runs with his personal and business partner Matt Krisiloff, the CEO of the biotech company Conception, which aims to create human eggs from stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s yet another technology that could change reproduction, if it works. Krisiloff is listed as a member of Preventive’s founding team.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of edited babies has received growing attention from figures in the cryptocurrency business. These include Brian Armstrong, the billionaire founder of Coinbase, who has held a series of off-the-record dinners to discuss the technology (which Harrington attended). Armstrong previously argued that the “time is right” for a startup venture in the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will Harborne, a crypto entrepreneur and partner at LongGame Ventures, says he’s “thrilled” to see Preventive launch. If the technology proves safe, he argues, “widespread adoption is inevitable,” calling its use a “societal obligation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harborne’s fund has invested in Herasight, a company that uses genetic tests to rank IVF embryos for future IQ and other traits. That’s another hotly debated technology, but one that has already reached the market, since such testing isn’t strictly regulated. Some have begun to use the term “human enhancement companies” to refer to such ventures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s still lacking is evidence that leading gene-editing specialists support these ventures. Preventive was unsuccessful in establishing a collaboration with at least one key research group, and Urnov says he had harsh words for Manhattan Genomics when that company reached out to him about working together. “I encourage you to stop,” he wrote back. “You will cause zero good and formidable harm.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harrington thinks Preventive could change such attitudes, if it shows that it is serious about doing responsible research. “Most scientists I speak with either accept embryo editing as inevitable or are enthusiastic about the potential but hesitate to voice these opinions publicly,” he told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year. “Part of being more public about this is to encourage others in the field to discuss this instead of ignoring it.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/crash-test-baby.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A West Coast biotech entrepreneur says he’s secured $30 million to form a public-benefit company to study how to safely create genetically edited babies, marking the largest known investment into the taboo technology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new company, called Preventive, is being formed to research so-called “heritable genome editing,” in which the DNA of embryos would be modified by correcting harmful mutations or installing beneficial genes.

          &lt;p&gt;Cursor has for the first time introduced what it claims is a competitive coding model, alongside the 2.0 version of its &lt;span class="wtBS9" id="_4iUFacC-BZvR0PEP-JWhyQQ_118"&gt;integrated development environment (&lt;/span&gt;IDE) with a new feature that allows running tasks with multiple agents in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s flagship product is an IDE modeled after Visual Studio Code in many respects, but with a strong emphasis on vibe coding and heavier direct integration of &lt;span class="wtBS9" id="_ESYFaejIBrXI0PEPtPSzuA4_99"&gt;large language model&lt;/span&gt;-based tools in the interface and workflow. Since its introduction, Cursor has supported models developed by other companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. However, while it has trialed its own built-in models, they weren’t competitive with the big frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a different story now, according to the company’s claims about Composer. Built with reinforcement learning and a mixture-of-experts architecture, Composer is dubbed by Cursor “a frontier model that is 4x faster than similarly intelligent models”—a significant claim when you consider what it’s competing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis seems to be on speed. In a benchmark chart displaying Cursor’s internal Cursor-Bench for intelligence and tokens per second for speed, Composer underperforms compared to the “best frontier” and outperforms top-tier open models and speed-oriented frontier models in intelligence. However, it vastly outpaces its competitors in speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cursor is hoping Composer will perform in terms of accuracy and best practices as well. It wasn’t trained on static datasets but rather interactive development challenges involving a range of agentic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguing claims and strong training methodology aside, it remains to be seen whether Composer will be able to compete with the best frontier models from the big players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even developers who might be natural users of Cursor would not want to waste much time on an unproven new model when something like Anthropic’s Claude is working just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address that, Cursor introduced Composer alongside its new multi-agent interface, which allows you to “run many agents in parallel without them interfering with one another, powered by git worktrees or remote machines”—that means using multiple models at once for the same task and comparing their results, then picking the best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is an invitation to try Composer and let the work speak for itself. We’ll see how devs feel about it in the coming weeks. So far, a non-representative sample of developers I’ve spoken with has told me they feel that Composer is not ineffective, but rather too expensive, given a perceived capability gap with the big models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the other new features and fixes for Cursor 2.0 in the changelog.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Cursor has for the first time introduced what it claims is a competitive coding model, alongside the 2.0 version of its &lt;span class="wtBS9" id="_4iUFacC-BZvR0PEP-JWhyQQ_118"&gt;integrated development environment (&lt;/span&gt;IDE) with a new feature that allows running tasks with multiple agents in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s flagship product is an IDE modeled after Visual Studio Code in many respects, but with a strong emphasis on vibe coding and heavier direct integration of &lt;span class="wtBS9" id="_ESYFaejIBrXI0PEPtPSzuA4_99"&gt;large language model&lt;/span&gt;-based tools in the interface and workflow. Since its introduction, Cursor has supported models developed by other companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. However, while it has trialed its own built-in models, they weren’t competitive with the big frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a different story now, according to the company’s claims about Composer. Built with reinforcement learning and a mixture-of-experts architecture, Composer is dubbed by Cursor “a frontier model that is 4x faster than similarly intelligent models”—a significant claim when you consider what it’s competing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis seems to be on speed. In a benchmark chart displaying Cursor’s internal Cursor-Bench for intelligence and tokens per second for speed, Composer underperforms compared to the “best frontier” and outperforms top-tier open models and speed-oriented frontier models in intelligence. However, it vastly outpaces its competitors in speed.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You’ll often hear plastic pollution referred to as a problem. But the reality is that it’s multiple problems. Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like polyesters and PET, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they’ve now got very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking down polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;

      The basics of the chemical bonds that link polyurethanes. The rest of the polymer is represented by X’s here.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new paper that describes the development of this enzyme lays out the scale of the problem: In 2024, we made 22 million metric tons of polyurethane. The urethane bond that defines these involves a nitrogen bonded to a carbon that in turn is bonded to two oxygens, one of which links into the rest of the polymer. The rest of the polymer, linked by these bonds, can be fairly complex and often contains ringed structures related to benzene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digesting polyurethanes is challenging. Individual polymer chains are often extensively cross-linked, and the bulky structures can make it difficult for enzymes to get at the bonds they can digest. A chemical called diethylene glycol can partially break these molecules down, but only at elevated temperatures. And it leaves behind a complicated mess of chemicals that can’t be fed back into any useful reactions. Instead, it’s typically incinerated as hazardous waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find something that could work better, the research team focused on finding an enzyme that could be integrated into the process with diethylene glycol. To begin, they tested all the enzymes reported in the literature as capable of breaking down polyurethanes. After testing all 15 of them, only three had decent activity against the polymer they were testing with, and they largely failed to break the polymer down to its constituent starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the researchers focused on the enzyme that had the highest activity, searching for related proteins in public databases, and using the AlphaFold database of predicted structures to identify more distantly related proteins that folded up into a similar structure. On their own, none of these worked especially well either. But they turned out to be useful because they could be used to train an AI to look for sequences that could fold up into a similar structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new enzyme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool the team started working with is called Pythia-Pocket, which is a neural network that specializes in determining whether any given amino acid in a protein is likely to contact whatever chemicals that structure can bind, along with any other functional features. That was combined with plain old Pythia (also a neural network), which predicts whether any given protein is likely to form a stable structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers reasoned that a good candidate for breaking down polyurethane would have a number of features. It would look, structurally, like the enzyme they had already been working with. It would also face a trade-off between having a structure that was ordered enough to form a similar binding pocket that would have enzymatic activity, but not so rigid that it couldn’t flexibly fit around different types of polyurethanes. To strike this balance, the team used a message-passing interface that updated amino acid positions with each pass and balanced optimizing the structure and binding pocket. They called the resulting software GRASE, for graph neural network-based recommendation of active and stable enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were pretty spectacular. Of the 24 most highly rated proteins the software evaluated, 21 of them showed some catalytic activity, and eight did better than the best enzyme we had known about previously. The best of these designs had 30 times the activity of that enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got even better when the researchers mixed in the diethylene glycol and heated the mixture up to 50° C. Under those conditions, the newly designed enzyme was over 450 times as active as the best-performing natural enzyme. It took 12 hours, but it could break down 98 percent of the polyurethane in the reaction mixture. And the enzyme was stable enough that it could be given a fresh mixture of polyurethane two additional times before its enzymatic activity started to wear out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting from lab tests to kilogram-scale digestion showed the same thing: 95 percent or more of the material was broken down into the starting materials the polyurethane was made from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight the fact that their tools go beyond simply focusing on the structure formed by the protein, but incorporate information about its function, such as its stability and the amino acids that are likely to interact with the material it’s digesting. And they suggest that these approaches may tell us more about how to get functional proteins by focusing on forming a similar 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You’ll often hear plastic pollution referred to as a problem. But the reality is that it’s multiple problems. Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like polyesters and PET, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they’ve now got very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking down polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;

      The basics of the chemical bonds that link polyurethanes. The rest of the polymer is represented by X’s here.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new paper that describes the development of this enzyme lays out the scale of the problem: In 2024, we made 22 million metric tons of polyurethane. The urethane bond that defines these involves a nitrogen bonded to a carbon that in turn is bonded to two oxygens, one of which links into the rest of the polymer. The rest of the polymer, linked by these bonds, can be fairly complex and often contains ringed structures related to benzene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digesting polyurethanes is challenging. Individual polymer chains are often extensively cross-linked, and the bulky structures can make it difficult for enzymes to get at the bonds they can digest. A chemical called diethylene glycol can partially break these molecules down, but only at elevated temperatures. And it leaves behind a complicated mess of chemicals that can’t be fed back into any useful reactions. Instead, it’s typically incinerated as hazardous waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, tech content creators began to suspect that AI was making it harder to share some of the most highly sought-after tech tutorials on YouTube, but now YouTube is denying that odd removals were due to automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creators grew alarmed when educational videos that YouTube had allowed for years were suddenly being bizarrely flagged as “dangerous” or “harmful,” with seemingly no way to trigger human review to overturn removals. AI seemed to be running the show, with creators’ appeals seemingly getting denied faster than a human could possibly review them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Friday, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed that videos flagged by Ars have been reinstated, promising that YouTube will take steps to ensure that similar content isn’t removed in the future. But, to creators, it remains unclear why the videos got taken down, as YouTube claimed that both initial enforcement decisions and decisions on appeals were not the result of an automation issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shocked creators were stuck speculating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich White, a computer technician who runs an account called CyberCPU Tech, had two videos removed that demonstrated workarounds to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These videos are popular, White told Ars, with people looking to bypass Microsoft account requirements each time a new build is released. For tech content creators like White, “these are bread and butter videos,” dependably yielding “extremely high views,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s such high demand, many tech content creators’ channels are filled with these kinds of videos. White’s account has “countless” examples, he said, and in the past, YouTube even featured his most popular video in the genre on a trending list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To White and others, it’s unclear exactly what has changed on YouTube that triggered removals of this type of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube only seemed to be removing recently posted content, White told Ars. However, if the takedowns ever impacted older content, entire channels documenting years of tech tutorials risked disappearing in “the blink of an eye,” another YouTuber behind a tech tips account called Britec09 warned after one of his videos was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The stakes appeared high for everyone, White warned, in a video titled “YouTube Tech Channels in Danger!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White had already censored content that he planned to post on his channel, fearing it wouldn’t be worth the risk of potentially losing his account, which began in 2020 as a side hustle but has since become his primary source of income. If he continues to change the content he posts to avoid YouTube penalties, it could hurt his account’s reach and monetization. Britec told Ars that he paused a sponsorship due to the uncertainty that he said has already hurt his channel and caused a “great loss of income.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube’s policies are strict, with the platform known to swiftly remove accounts that receive three strikes for violating community guidelines within 90 days. But, curiously, White had not received any strikes following his content removals. Although Britec reported that his account had received a strike following his video’s removal, White told Ars that YouTube so far had only given him two warnings, so his account is not yet at risk of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creators weren’t sure why YouTube might deem this content as harmful, so they tossed around some theories. It seemed possible, White suggested in his video, that AI was detecting this content as “piracy,” but that shouldn’t be the case, he claimed, since his guides require users to have a valid license to install Windows 11. He also thinks it’s unlikely that Microsoft prompted the takedowns, suggesting tech content creators have a “love-hate relationship” with the tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t like what we’re doing, but I don’t think they’re going to get rid of it,” White told Ars, suggesting that Microsoft “could stop us in our tracks” if it were motivated to end workarounds. But Microsoft doesn’t do that, White said, perhaps because it benefits from popular tutorials that attract swarms of Windows 11 users who otherwise may not use “their flagship operating system” if they can’t bypass Microsoft account requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those users could become loyal to Microsoft, White said. And eventually, some users may even “get tired of bypassing the Microsoft account requirements, or Microsoft will add a new feature that they’ll happily get the account for, and they’ll relent and start using a Microsoft account,” White suggested in his video. “At least some people will, not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To White, it seemed possible that YouTube was leaning on AI &amp;nbsp;to catch more violations but perhaps recognized the risk of over-moderation and, therefore, wasn’t allowing AI to issue strikes on his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was just a “theory” that he and other creators came up with, but couldn’t confirm, since YouTube’s chatbot that supports creators seemed to also be “suspiciously AI-driven,” seemingly auto-responding even when a “supervisor” is connected, White said in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absent more clarity from YouTube, creators who post tutorials, tech tips, and computer repair videos were spooked. Their biggest fear was that unexpected changes to automated content moderation could unexpectedly knock them off YouTube for posting videos that in tech circles seem ordinary and commonplace, White and Britec said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not even sure what we can make videos on,” White said. “Everything’s a theory right now because we don’t have anything solid from YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouTube recommends making the content it’s removing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White’s channel gained popularity after YouTube highlighted an early trending video that he made, showing a workaround to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. Following that video, his channel’s views spiked, and then he gradually built up his subscriber base to around 330,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, White’s videos in that category had been flagged as violative, but human review got them quickly reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“They were striked for the same reason, but at that time, I guess the AI revolution hadn’t taken over,” White said. “So it was relatively easy to talk to a real person. And by talking to a real person, they were like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid.’ And they brought the videos back.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, YouTube suggests that human review is causing the removals, which likely doesn’t completely ease creators’ fears about arbitrary takedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Britec’s video was also flagged as dangerous or harmful. He has managed his account that currently has nearly 900,000 subscribers since 2009, and he’s worried he risked losing “years of hard work,” he said in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britec told Ars that “it’s very confusing” for panicked tech content creators trying to understand what content is permissible. It’s particularly frustrating, he noted in his video, that YouTube’s creator tool inspiring “ideas” for posts seemed to contradict the mods’ content warnings and continued to recommend that creators make content on specific topics like workarounds to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This tool was to give you ideas for your next video,” Britec said. “And you can see right here, it’s telling you to create content on these topics. And if you did this, I can guarantee you your channel will get a strike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, creators hit what White described as a “brick wall,” with one of his appeals denied within one minute, which felt like it must be an automated decision. As Britec explained, “You will appeal, and your appeal will be rejected instantly. You will not be speaking to a human being. You’ll be speaking to a bot or AI. The bot will be giving you automated responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube insisted that the decisions weren’t automated, even when an appeal was denied within one minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White told Ars that it’s easy for creators to be discouraged and censor their channels rather than fight with the AI. After wasting “an hour and a half trying to reason with an AI about why I didn’t violate the community guidelines” once his first appeal was quickly denied, he “didn’t even bother using the chat function” after the second appeal was denied even faster, White confirmed in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I simply wasn’t going to do that again,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All week, the panic spread, reaching fans who follow tech content creators. On&amp;nbsp;Reddit, people recommended saving tutorials lest they risk YouTube taking them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had people come out and say, ‘This can’t be true. I rely on this every time,'” White told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes appeared high for everyone, White warned, in a video titled “YouTube Tech Channels in Danger!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White had already censored content that he planned to post on his channel, fearing it wouldn’t be worth the risk of potentially losing his account, which began in 2020 as a side hustle but has since become his primary source of income. If he continues to change the content he posts to avoid YouTube penalties, it could hurt his account’s reach and monetization. Britec told Ars that he paused a sponsorship due to the uncertainty that he said has already hurt his channel and caused a “great loss of income.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube’s policies are strict, with the platform known to swiftly remove accounts that receive three strikes for violating community guidelines within 90 days. But, curiously, White had not received any strikes following his content removals. Although Britec reported that his account had received a strike following his video’s removal, White told Ars that YouTube so far had only given him two warnings, so his account is not yet at risk of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creators weren’t sure why YouTube might deem this content as harmful, so they tossed around some theories. It seemed possible, White suggested in his video, that AI was detecting this content as “piracy,” but that shouldn’t be the case, he claimed, since his guides require users to have a valid license to install Windows 11. He also thinks it’s unlikely that Microsoft prompted the takedowns, suggesting tech content creators have a “love-hate relationship” with the tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t like what we’re doing, but I don’t think they’re going to get rid of it,” White told Ars, suggesting that Microsoft “could stop us in our tracks” if it were motivated to end workarounds. But Microsoft doesn’t do that, White said, perhaps because it benefits from popular tutorials that attract swarms of Windows 11 users who otherwise may not use “their flagship operating system” if they can’t bypass Microsoft account requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those users could become loyal to Microsoft, White said. And eventually, some users may even “get tired of bypassing the Microsoft account requirements, or Microsoft will add a new feature that they’ll happily get the account for, and they’ll relent and start using a Microsoft account,” White suggested in his video. “At least some people will, not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To White, it seemed possible that YouTube was leaning on AI &amp;nbsp;to catch more violations but perhaps recognized the risk of over-moderation and, therefore, wasn’t allowing AI to issue strikes on his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was just a “theory” that he and other creators came up with, but couldn’t confirm, since YouTube’s chatbot that supports creators seemed to also be “suspiciously AI-driven,” seemingly auto-responding even when a “supervisor” is connected, White said in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absent more clarity from YouTube, creators who post tutorials, tech tips, and computer repair videos were spooked. Their biggest fear was that unexpected changes to automated content moderation could unexpectedly knock them off YouTube for posting videos that in tech circles seem ordinary and commonplace, White and Britec said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not even sure what we can make videos on,” White said. “Everything’s a theory right now because we don’t have anything solid from YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouTube recommends making the content it’s removing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White’s channel gained popularity after YouTube highlighted an early trending video that he made, showing a workaround to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. Following that video, his channel’s views spiked, and then he gradually built up his subscriber base to around 330,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, White’s videos in that category had been flagged as violative, but human review got them quickly reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“They were striked for the same reason, but at that time, I guess the AI revolution hadn’t taken over,” White said. “So it was relatively easy to talk to a real person. And by talking to a real person, they were like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid.’ And they brought the videos back.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, YouTube suggests that human review is causing the removals, which likely doesn’t completely ease creators’ fears about arbitrary takedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britec’s video was also flagged as dangerous or harmful. He has managed his account that currently has nearly 900,000 subscribers since 2009, and he’s worried he risked losing “years of hard work,” he said in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britec told Ars that “it’s very confusing” for panicked tech content creators trying to understand what content is permissible. It’s particularly frustrating, he noted in his video, that YouTube’s creator tool inspiring “ideas” for posts seemed to contradict the mods’ content warnings and continued to recommend that creators make content on specific topics like workarounds to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This tool was to give you ideas for your next video,” Britec said. “And you can see right here, it’s telling you to create content on these topics. And if you did this, I can guarantee you your channel will get a strike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, creators hit what White described as a “brick wall,” with one of his appeals denied within one minute, which felt like it must be an automated decision. As Britec explained, “You will appeal, and your appeal will be rejected instantly. You will not be speaking to a human being. You’ll be speaking to a bot or AI. The bot will be giving you automated responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube insisted that the decisions weren’t automated, even when an appeal was denied within one minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White told Ars that it’s easy for creators to be discouraged and censor their channels rather than fight with the AI. After wasting “an hour and a half trying to reason with an AI about why I didn’t violate the community guidelines” once his first appeal was quickly denied, he “didn’t even bother using the chat function” after the second appeal was denied even faster, White confirmed in his video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I simply wasn’t going to do that again,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All week, the panic spread, reaching fans who follow tech content creators. On&amp;nbsp;Reddit, people recommended saving tutorials lest they risk YouTube taking them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had people come out and say, ‘This can’t be true. I rely on this every time,'” White told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
