&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India became the world’s largest market for generative AI app downloads in 2025, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, widening its lead over the U.S. as installs jumped 207% year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity rolled out extended free premium offers to accelerate user growth in the price sensitive market. Leading AI firms have also backed India in its push to become a global artificial intelligence hub. A major AI summit in New Delhi last week was attended by leaders including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai — a sign of the country’s growing weight in the global AI race. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, some of those early promotional pushes are winding down. Perplexity ended its bundled Pro offer with Indian telco Airtel in January, while OpenAI’s free ChatGPT Go access in India is no longer available, potentially setting the stage for a clearer test of how many newly acquired users convert to paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite strong download growth, India still generates a disproportionately small share of AI app revenue, accounting for about 1% of in-app purchases even as it drives roughly 20% of global GenAI app downloads, according to the Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch, highlighting the monetization challenge in one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GenAI app adoption in India accelerated sharply through 2025, with downloads peaking in September and October at year-over-year growth rates of about 320% and 260%, respectively, according to the data. Yet the surge in usage did not fully translate into revenue gains. In November and December 2025, AI app in-app purchase revenue in India fell 22% and 18% month over month, respectively. ChatGPT’s revenue dropped even more sharply — down 33% and 32% over the same period following the November launch of free sub-$5 ChatGPT Go access — reflecting the near-term impact of aggressive promotional pushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT still commands more than 60% of GenAI in-app revenue in India, meaning shifts in its pricing strategy can significantly influence overall market performance.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside promotional pushes, Sensor Tower attributed the surge in GenAI app adoption in India last year to a mix of new product launches, including the debut of platforms such as DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI, as well as upgrades to major chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. Viral interest in AI-generated content also helped fuel adoption, with content creation and editing tools accounting for seven of the 20 most downloaded GenAI apps in India in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The user surge has been equally pronounced. India accounted for about 19% of the global user base of leading AI assistant apps in 2025, ahead of the U.S. at 10%, Sensor Tower said. ChatGPT continues to dominate the Indian market by monthly active users, though rivals including Google’s Gemini and Perplexity have also seen rapid growth following promotional offers. ChatGPT was the most downloaded GenAI app in India and globally in 2025, according to earlier Sensor Tower data. Earlier this month, OpenAI’s CEO said that the chatbot now has more than 100 million weekly active users in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The promotional push in India reflects a broader strategy by AI firms to reduce pricing friction in a highly value-conscious market, betting that early user adoption and engagement will translate into stronger long-term retention once free access periods expire, said Sneha Pandey, insights analyst at Sensor Tower.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s appeal lies in its massive digital base. The country has more than a billion internet users and around 700 million smartphone owners, making it one of the largest potential markets for AI services globally and a critical battleground for user growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, user engagement in India still trails more mature markets. In 2025, users of leading AI chatbot apps in the U.S. spent about 21% more time per week on the apps than their counterparts in India and logged 17% more sessions on average, per Sensor Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI in-app revenues will likely see meaningful but gradual improvement as users become more deeply integrated into these platforms, making sustained engagement paramount,” Pandey told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She added that pricing pressure in India is likely to remain elevated given the country’s young and value-conscious user base, making lower-cost tiers, telecom bundles, and micro-transaction models important for long-term retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT remained the clear market leader in India entering 2026, with 180 million monthly active users in January, per Sensor Tower, followed by Google’s Gemini with 118 million, Perplexity with 19 million, and Meta AI with 12 million. The figures underline both the scale of India’s AI opportunity and the growing challenge for firms to convert rapid user adoption into sustained revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Originally from the small Balkan country of Montenegro, Strahinja (Strajo) Janjusevic says his life has unfolded in unexpected ways, for which he is deeply grateful. After graduating from high school, he was selected to represent his country in the United States, studying cyber operations and computer science at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He has since continued his cybersecurity studies and is currently a second-year master’s student in the Technology and Policy Program (TPP), hosted by the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS). His research with the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and the MIT Maritime Consortium team aims to improve the cybersecurity of critical maritime infrastructure using artificial intelligence, considering both the technology and policy frameworks of solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My current research focuses on applying AI techniques to cybersecurity problems and examining the policy implications of these advancements, especially in the context of maritime cybersecurity,” says Janjusevic. “Representing my country at the highest levels of education and industry has given me a unique perspective on cybersecurity challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janjusevic’s pathway from Montenegro to Maryland was created by a program that allows&amp;nbsp;selected students from allied countries to attend the U.S. Naval Academy. Janjusevic graduated with a dual bachelor’s degree in cyber operations and computer science. His undergraduate experience provided opportunities to collaborate with the U.S. military and the National Security Agency, exposing him to high-level cybersecurity operations and fueling his interest in tackling complex cybersecurity challenges. During his undergraduate studies, he also interned with Microsoft, developing tools for cloud incident response, and with NASA, visualizing solar data for research applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, he realized that he still needed more knowledge, particularly in the area of AI and cybersecurity. TPP appealed to him immediately because of its dual emphasis on rigorous engineering innovation and the policy analysis needed to deploy it effectively. Janjusevic’s experiences at TPP have been a big change from his time at the U.S. Naval Academy, with a different pace and environment. He has especially appreciated being able to broaden his understanding about a variety of research domains and apply the discipline and knowledge he earned during his time at the academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My TPP experience has been amazing,” says Janjusevic. “The cohort is really small, so it feels like a family, and everyone is working on diverse, high-impact problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigating the risks of emerging technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janjusevic’s thesis brings together disciplines of cybersecurity, AI and deep learning, and control theory and physics, focusing on securing maritime cyber-physical systems — in particular, large legacy ships. The hacking of these ships’ networks can result in substantial damage to national security, as well as serious economic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strajo is working to outsmart maritime GPS spoofing,” says Saurabh Amin, the Edmund K. Turner Professor in Civil Engineering. “Such attacks have already lured vessels off course in contested waters. His approach layers physics-based trajectory models with deep learning, catching threats that no single method can detect alone. His expertise has been very helpful in advancing our work on threat modeling and attack detection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research utilizes advanced threat modeling and vessel dynamics to train AI systems to distinguish between legitimate maneuvers and spoofed signals. It involves building a framework&amp;nbsp;that employs an internal LSTM (long short-term memory) autoencoder to analyze signal integrity, while simultaneously using a physics-based forecaster to predict the vessel's movement based on environmental factors like wind and the sea state. By comparing these predictions against reported GPS positions, the system can effectively distinguish between natural sensor noise and malicious spoofing attacks. This hybrid framework is designed to empower, not replace, human operators, providing verified navigation data that allows watch standers to distinguish technical glitches from strategic cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjusevic has been able to enhance his academic research with industry experience. In summer 2025, he interned with the Network Detection team at the AI cybersecurity company Vectra AI. There, he investigated potential threats new technologies can bring, particularly AI agents and the model context protocol (MCP) — the emerging standard for AI agent communication. His research demonstrated how this technology could be repurposed for autonomous hacking operations and advanced command and control. This work on the security risks of agentic AI was recently presented in the preprint, “Hiding in the AI Traffic: Abusing MCP for LLM-Powered Agentic Red Teaming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was able to gain practical insights and hands-on experience into how a data science team uses AI models to detect anomalies in a network,” says Janjusevic. “This work within industry directly informed the anomaly detection models in my research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International policy perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strajo brings not just a high level of intelligence and energy to his work on cyber-physical security for merchant vessels, but also a strong instinct from his Navy training that resonates deeply with the research effort and grounds it in actionable policy,” says Fotini Christia, the Ford International Professor of the Social Sciences, director of IDSS and the MIT Sociotechnical Systems Research Center, and a leader of the MIT Maritime Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janjusevic participates in the cybersecurity efforts of the Maritime Consortium, a collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory agencies focused on developing technological solutions, industry standards, and policies. The consortium includes cooperation with some international members, including from Singapore and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In AI cybersecurity, the policy element is really important, as the field is so fast-moving and the consequences of hacking can be so dangerous,” says Janjusevic. “I think there’s still a lot of need for policy work in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janjusevic is also currently helping to organize two upcoming major conferences: the Harvard European Conference in February, which will convene officials and diplomats from across the globe, and the Technology and National Security Conference in April, a collaboration of Harvard and MIT that brings together top leaders from government, industry, and academia to tackle critical challenges in national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m striving to find a position where I can influence and advance the cybersecurity field with AI, while at the same time leading collaboration and innovation between the United States and Montenegro,” says Janjusevic. “My goal is to be a bridge between Europe and the U.S. in this space of national security, AI, and cybersecurity, bringing my knowledge to both sides.”&lt;/p&gt;        

      &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Studying gene expression in a cancer patient’s cells can help clinical biologists understand the cancer’s origin and predict the success of different treatments. But cells are complex and contain many layers, so how the biologist conducts measurements affects which data they can obtain. For instance, measuring&amp;nbsp;proteins in a cell could yield different information about the effects of cancer&amp;nbsp;than measuring gene expression or cell morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where in the cell the information comes from matters. But to capture complete information about the state of the cell, scientists often must conduct many measurements using different techniques and analyze them one at a time. Machine-learning methods can speed up the process, but existing methods lump all the information from each measurement modality together, making it difficult to figure out which data came from which part of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this problem, researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and ETH Zurich/Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) developed an artificial intelligence-driven framework that learns which information about a cell’s state is shared across different measurement modalities and which information is unique to a particular measurement type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing which information came from which cell parts, the approach provides a more holistic view of the cell’s state, making it easier for a biologist to see the complete picture of cellular interactions. This could help scientists understand disease mechanisms and track the progression of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s, and metabolic diseases like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we study cells, one measurement is often not sufficient, so scientists develop new technologies to measure different aspects of cells. While we have many ways of looking at a cell, at the end of the day we only have one underlying cell state. By putting the information from all these measurement modalities together in a smarter way, we could have a fuller picture of the state of the cell,” says lead author Xinyi Zhang SM ’22, PhD ’25, a former&amp;nbsp;graduate student in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and an affiliate of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, who is now a group leader at AITHYRA in Vienna, Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang is joined on a paper about the work by G.V. Shivashankar, a professor in the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich and head of the Laboratory of Multiscale Bioimaging at PSI; and senior author Caroline Uhler, a&amp;nbsp;professor in EECS and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, member of MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), and director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute. The research appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Computational Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulating multiple measurements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many tools scientists can use to capture information about a cell’s state. For instance, they can measure RNA to see if the cell is growing, or they can measure chromatin morphology&amp;nbsp;to see if the cell is dealing with external physical or chemical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When scientists perform multimodal analysis, they gather information using multiple measurement modalities and integrate it to better understand the underlying state of the cell. Some information is captured by one modality only, while other information is shared across modalities. To fully understand what is happening inside the cell, it is important to know where the information came from,” says Shivashankar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, for scientists, the only way to sort this out is to conduct multiple individual experiments and compare the results. This slow and cumbersome process limits the amount of information they can gather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new work, the researchers built a machine-learning framework that specifically understands which information overlaps between different modalities, and which information is unique to a particular modality but not captured by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a user, you can simply input your cell data and it automatically tells you which data are shared and which data are modality-specific,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build this framework, the researchers rethought the typical way machine-learning models are designed to capture and interpret multimodal cellular measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually these methods, known as autoencoders, have one model for each measurement modality, and each model encodes a separate representation for the data captured by that modality. The representation is a compressed version of the input data that discards any irrelevant details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT method has a shared representation space where data that overlap between multiple modalities are encoded, as well as separate spaces where unique data from each modality are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, one can think of it like a Venn diagram of cellular data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used a special, two-step training procedure that helps their model handle the complexity involved in deciding which data are shared across multiple data&amp;nbsp;modalities. After training, the model can identify which data are shared and which are unique when fed cell data it has never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguishing data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on synthetic datasets, the framework correctly captured known shared and modality-specific information. When they applied their method to real-world single-cell datasets, it&amp;nbsp;comprehensively and automatically distinguished between gene activity captured jointly by two measurement modalities, such as transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, while also correctly identifying which information came from only one of those modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers used their method to identify which measurement modality captured a certain protein marker that indicates DNA damage in cancer patients. Knowing where this information came from would help a clinical scientist determine which technique they should use to measure that marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are too many modalities in a cell and we can’t possibly measure them all, so we need a prediction tool. But then the question is: Which modalities should we measure and which modalities should we predict? Our method can answer that question,” Uhler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to enable the model to provide more interpretable information about the state of the cell. They also want to conduct additional experiments to ensure it correctly disentangles cellular information and apply the model to a wider range of clinical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not sufficient to just integrate the information from all these modalities,” Uhler says. “We can learn a lot about the state of a cell if we carefully compare the different modalities to understand how different components of cells regulate each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, AstraZeneca, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the MIT J-Clinic for Machine Learning and Health, and a Simons Investigator Award.&lt;/p&gt;

AI may soon be making operational decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Nokia and AWS presented a new network slicing system that uses AI agents to monitor network conditions and adjust resources automatically. The setup is being tested by telecom operators du in the United Arab Emirates and Orange in Europe and Africa, according to a joint announcement from Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adaptive AI-driven networks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network slicing lets operators create multiple virtual networks on the same physical infrastructure, each tuned for a different purpose. For example, a slice may be configured for emergency services or high-bandwidth consumer traffic. While slicing is part of the 5G standard, it has often required manual planning and fixed configurations, which limits how quickly networks can respond to changing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system aims to close that gap by introducing AI agents that track network performance indicators like latency and congestion, and consider data like event schedules or weather conditions. Agents can then adjust network settings to keep services running to agreed performance levels, according to Nokia’s description of the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS said the solution combines Nokia’s slicing and automation tools with AI models delivered through Amazon Bedrock, its managed AI service platform. The companies describe the approach as “agentic AI”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Autonomous connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interest in such systems reflects a long-standing challenge: 5G networks have delivered higher speeds and lower latency, but operators have struggled to turn those technical gains into new revenue streams. Research firm GSMA Intelligence notes many operators view network slicing as a potential source of enterprise income, though adoption has been slow due to operational complexity and uncertain demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If networks can adapt quickly to sudden demand, like a crowded stadium or emergency responders entering a disaster area, operators may be able to offer temporary connectivity or guaranteed service levels without manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange has said previously enterprise customers expect connectivity to behave more like cloud computing, where resources can scale on demand. Systems that allow automated control of network resources could help move telecom services closer to that model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud platforms and telecom network operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests also highlight how cloud providers are getting involved in telecom operations. Over the past few years, some operators have moved parts of their core networks onto public cloud platforms or built cloud-based control systems. Industry analysts at Dell’Oro Group report that telecom cloud spending is rising as operators modernise networks and adopt software-driven infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding AI-driven control loops on top of cloud platforms represents the next step, with AI systems monitoring conditions and applying adjustments quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology remains in a testing phase. Nokia’s announcement described the work with Orange as demonstrations and pilots rollouts. Questions remain about how such systems can be deployed, how operators will supervise automated decisions, and how regulators will view AI control of critical communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telecom networks carry important traffic so reliability and accountability remain central concerns. Operators typically introduce automation gradually, keeping human oversight in place while validating system behaviour under real conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments suggest that AI is beginning to function as operational controller, adjusting physical and virtual resources in response to live events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises that rely on private 5G networks for factories or large venues may gain access to connectivity that adjusts automatically.

My iPhone suddenly shut down. When I restarted it, I found it was totally reset—clean, like a new device. This was the early days of iOS, so I wasn’t too concerned until I went to connect it to my computer to restore it from a backup. But when I flipped open the lid of my laptop, it too was mid-restart. And then, suddenly, the screen went gray. It was being remotely wiped. I turned on my iPad. It, too, had been wiped. I was being hacked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frantically, I shut down all my devices, unplugged everything connected to the internet in my house, turned off my router, and went next door to use my neighbors’ computer and find out what was going on. Deepening my panic, I realized hackers had also gained control of, and nuked, my Google account. Worse, they were in control of my Twitter, which they were gleefully using to spew all sorts of vile comments. It was nasty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to remember, this was before all of us lived with a constant rain of text messages and emails designed to elicit the information necessary to pull something like this off. These crooks hadn’t brute-forced their way in, or used any sort of sophisticated techniques to gain access to my accounts. Instead, they had relied on publicly available information, and a fake credit card number, to socially engineer their way into my Amazon account, where they looked up the last four digits of my real credit card number. Then they used that information to get into Apple. And because that account was linked to my Gmail, and that to my Twitter, it gave them the keys to everything.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what really troubled me was what I learned as I followed up on my hack over the ensuing weeks and months: This kind of thing was, while still novel, becoming more common. Some version of what happened to me had happened to lots of other people. The kids who were responsible—it was a couple of kids—weren’t criminal masterminds. They had just found a gap, a place where a technology was now commonplace but its risks and exploitable surface areas weren’t yet fully understood. I just happened to have all my stuff in the gap. Today that gap might feature a crypto wallet or a deepfake of a loved one’s voice. (Or both.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crime changes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The goals stay the same—pursuit of value, pursuit of power—but new technologies create new vulnerabilities, new tactics, and new ways for perpetrators to evade discovery or capture. And the law necessarily lags behind. Relying not on innovation but on precedent, it is intentionally backward-looking and slow. That plodding consideration used to be how we protected our shared democratic society, how we protected each other from each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But those same new technologies that have allowed crime to outpace law have also reenergized law enforcement and government—offering new ways to root out crime, to gather evidence, to surveil people. Think, for example, of how cold-case investigators tracked down the Golden State Killer years after his murders, using DNA samples and genealogy databases—launching a new era of DNA-powered investigations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Technology has long made crime and its prosecution a game of cat and mouse. It sometimes calls into question the nature of crime itself. Unregulated behaviors, facilitated by technology, can exist in murky zones of dubious legality. (Until TikTok announced its new ownership structure, Apple and Google were both technically breaking the law by allowing the app to stay on their platforms, under the provisions of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Ah! Well. Nevertheless.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tension is the key to our March/April issue. Thanks to technologies like cryptocurrency and off-the-shelf autonomous autopilots, there’s never been a better time to do crime. Thanks to pervasive surveillance and digital infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to fight it—sometimes at the expense of what we used to think of as fundamental civil rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I never pressed charges against the kids who hacked me.

My iPhone suddenly shut down. When I restarted it, I found it was totally reset—clean, like a new device. This was the early days of iOS, so I wasn’t too concerned until I went to connect it to my computer to restore it from a backup. But when I flipped open the lid of my laptop, it too was mid-restart. And then, suddenly, the screen went gray. It was being remotely wiped. I turned on my iPad. It, too, had been wiped. I was being hacked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frantically, I shut down all my devices, unplugged everything connected to the internet in my house, turned off my router, and went next door to use my neighbors’ computer and find out what was going on. Deepening my panic, I realized hackers had also gained control of, and nuked, my Google account. Worse, they were in control of my Twitter, which they were gleefully using to spew all sorts of vile comments. It was nasty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to remember, this was before all of us lived with a constant rain of text messages and emails designed to elicit the information necessary to pull something like this off. These crooks hadn’t brute-forced their way in, or used any sort of sophisticated techniques to gain access to my accounts. Instead, they had relied on publicly available information, and a fake credit card number, to socially engineer their way into my Amazon account, where they looked up the last four digits of my real credit card number. Then they used that information to get into Apple. And because that account was linked to my Gmail, and that to my Twitter, it gave them the keys to everything.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what really troubled me was what I learned as I followed up on my hack over the ensuing weeks and months: This kind of thing was, while still novel, becoming more common. Some version of what happened to me had happened to lots of other people. The kids who were responsible—it was a couple of kids—weren’t criminal masterminds. They had just found a gap, a place where a technology was now commonplace but its risks and exploitable surface areas weren’t yet fully understood. I just happened to have all my stuff in the gap. Today that gap might feature a crypto wallet or a deepfake of a loved one’s voice. (Or both.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crime changes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The goals stay the same—pursuit of value, pursuit of power—but new technologies create new vulnerabilities, new tactics, and new ways for perpetrators to evade discovery or capture. And the law necessarily lags behind. Relying not on innovation but on precedent, it is intentionally backward-looking and slow. That plodding consideration used to be how we protected our shared democratic society, how we protected each other from each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But those same new technologies that have allowed crime to outpace law have also reenergized law enforcement and government—offering new ways to root out crime, to gather evidence, to surveil people. Think, for example, of how cold-case investigators tracked down the Golden State Killer years after his murders, using DNA samples and genealogy databases—launching a new era of DNA-powered investigations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Technology has long made crime and its prosecution a game of cat and mouse. It sometimes calls into question the nature of crime itself. Unregulated behaviors, facilitated by technology, can exist in murky zones of dubious legality. (Until TikTok announced its new ownership structure, Apple and Google were both technically breaking the law by allowing the app to stay on their platforms, under the provisions of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Ah! Well. Nevertheless.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tension is the key to our March/April issue. Thanks to technologies like cryptocurrency and off-the-shelf autonomous autopilots, there’s never been a better time to do crime. Thanks to pervasive surveillance and digital infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to fight it—sometimes at the expense of what we used to think of as fundamental civil rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I never pressed charges against the kids who hacked me. The biggest consequence of the hack was that Apple set up two-factor authentication in the following months, which felt like a win. Now I’m not sure anyone expects their personal data to be secure in any meaningful way. I’m certain, though, that somewhere on the net, a new generation of kids is coming up with another novel crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/25/1132840/editors-letter-march-2026/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] 3 things Juliet Beauchamp is into right now (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/25/1132836/3-things-juliet-beauchamp/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8278-3.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only reality show that matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City&lt;/em&gt; is one of the best shows on television right now. Not one of the best reality TV shows, but one of the best TV shows, period. Chronicling a shifting group of wealthy women in and around Salt Lake, the show has featured a convicted felon whom federal agents came looking for while cameras were rolling, a church leader married to her step-grandfather, and a single mom in an exhausting on-again, off-again relationship with an Osmond. In one season, there was an ongoing argument between two cast members after one told the other that she “smelled like hospital.” Later, one woman was secretly running an anonymous gossip Instagram about her fellow housewives. We can debate the “reality” of reality television, and it’s certainly true that these characters and scenarios are far-fetched. But every single person is dealing with something relatable—difficult marriages, failing businesses, strained relationships with children, addiction. It’s entertainment, and high camp, but I find that I still have a lot of empathy for these people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last good place(s) on Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Facebook sucks.

The spirit of community and camaraderie is alive and well there—and probably in yours, too. A non-exhaustive list of things I have given away: empty candle jars, a bookcase, used lightbulbs, unopened toiletries, bubble wrap. I’ve scored a few good things as well: a gorgeous antique dresser that I refinished, some over-the-door hooks, and brand-new jeans. It makes me happy to know that stuff that would’ve otherwise ended up in a landfill is bringing one of my neighbors joy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going analog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I used to wear an Apple Watch a lot. I’m a pretty active person, and I liked tracking my workouts and my steps. But after I’d had it for a while, my watch started dying in the middle of a 30-minute run; it became useless to me, and I gave it up completely. Guess what? I’m happier. I feel more present when I’m not checking how much time is left in a yoga class or reading texts during a long run. The amount of data it gathered about me was also stressing me out, and it wasn’t useful. And I don’t need a wearable to tell me how poorly I slept!

Sound, even infrasound, is really just variations in air pressure. So House built a set of three “macrophones,” tubes that funnel air into a barometer capable of taking readings 100 times a second. From the quiet woods of western Massachusetts, House can pick up what the planet is laying down. Then he speeds the recording up by a factor of 60 so that it’s audible to the wee ears of humans. “I am really interested in the layers of perception that we can’t access,” he says. “It’s not only low sound, but it’s also distant sound. That kind of blew my mind.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;House’s album is art, but scientists made it possible. Barometers picked up the 1883 eruption of the South Pacific volcano Krakatoa as far away as London. And today, a global network of infrasound sensors helps enforce the nuclear test ban treaty. A few infrasound experts—like Leif Karlstrom, a volcanologist at the University of Oregon who uses infrasound to study Mount Kilauea in Hawaii—helped House set up his music-gathering array and better understand what he was hearing. “He’s highlighting interesting phenomena,” Karlstrom says, even though it’s impossible to tell exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is making each specific sound.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;So how’s the actual music? It’s 24 minutes of an otherworldly chorus, alternating between low grumbling vibrations and soft ghostlike whispers. A high-pitched whistle? Could be a train, House says. An intense low-octave rattle? Maybe a distant thunderstorm or a shifting ocean current. “For me, it’s about the mystery of it,” he says. “I hope that’s a little bit unsettling.” But it also might connect someone listening to a wider—and deeper—world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monique Brouillette is a freelance writer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ei_overhead-sc.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boom of a calving glacier.
