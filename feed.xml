&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was always broadly interested in technology and startups, but I never really thought I’d be an entrepreneur. I assumed I was set to become a lawyer; most of my family members are lawyers, and practicing law felt like a natural path,” Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. But when he got to Harvard Law, the education wasn’t quite what he expected, Lee said, adding that he began to question whether a career as a corporate lawyer was the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So I started exploring different ideas. One day, I took a trademark class and learned that counterfeiting is the world’s largest criminal enterprise, $3 trillion in counterfeit products traded every year, about 8% of global commerce. What struck me was that during COVID, as everything was moving online, this already massive market was growing 20% a year, fueled by marketplaces and social media,” Lee continued. “I saw it as a universal problem—and one that could be solved with the technology I was passionate about at the time: computer vision.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That insight became the seed for MarqVision, the company he later co-founded in 2021. The name itself reflects its origins: “Marq” from trademark, and “Vision” from computer vision. The mission was straightforward but ambitious: harness AI-powered computer vision to fight counterfeiting and trademark infringement on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fast forward to 2025 and the LA-headquartered AI startup has closed a $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to about $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roughly half of the fresh capital will go toward expanding its AI and engineering teams to accelerate automation and integrate generative AI across its product suite. Another $10 million is earmarked for making the platform enterprise-ready as the company moves upmarket to target larger brands, while an additional $10 million will fund regional expansion. Already active in the U.S., Korea, China, and Europe, MarqVision is now entering Japan, highlighting the borderless nature of IP law and the company’s push to scale globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The financing was led by Peak XV Partners — formerly Sequoia Capital India &amp;amp; SEA — with participation from Salesforce Ventures, HSG (formerly Sequoia China), Coral Capital, and Michael Seibel, partner emeritus at Y Combinator. Returning backers, including YC, Altos Ventures, and Atinum Investment, also joined the round.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Increasingly, top-tier investors are looking for technology companies that leverage AI not just to enhance productivity, but to fundamentally transform service delivery,” Lee explained. “AI is expanding the total addressable market for software from efficiency tools into the execution of the work itself — unlocking a market opportunity of over $10 trillion. While many early-stage companies are experimenting with AI to disrupt labor-intensive service industries, very few have reached the early growth stage with the scale and traction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MarqVision serves more than 350 customers worldwide across industries ranging from fashion and luxury to gaming, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, automotive, and consumer electronics. The startup reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossed $20 million after four years, doubling annually along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is $100M ARR by mid-2027,” Lee said. “Growth could have been faster, but we prioritized two things: delivering the best customer experience and building a scalable AI-driven foundation. As a managed service, we can monetize many offerings, but everything ties back to one core promise—helping global brands control their digital presence and grow revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once considered an unappealing category in technology, “services” is being redefined by AI, which brings software-like scalability and efficiency. This shift has fueled investor interest, with Peak XV, HSG, and Salesforce Ventures backing the company’s vision. The rise of large language models has reframed its positioning from a “software company with humans in the loop” to a leader in the emerging AI-led services space, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MarqVision started out fighting counterfeits, using AI to spot and remove fake products online. As the technology advanced, the startup shifted its focus toward helping brands directly recover lost revenue. Today, many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales, making the platform valuable not just to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations tracking revenue impact, according to Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Lee first pitched MarqVision, he envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling $50,000 tools to 10,000 IP teams worldwide. But YC partner Michael Seibel urged him to think bigger — beyond software — by reimagining how IP and brand professionals work. MarqVision has since expanded into end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100 times larger than his original plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brand protection typically involves detecting and removing infringements like counterfeits and impersonations, while brand control goes further, giving companies the ability to manage their presence across e-commerce, social media, websites, and chat platforms, Lee noted. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes brand intelligence, offering insights into supply chains, pricing strategies, and reseller networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our vision is to be the backbone of every global brand that owns IP — becoming the AI-led services platform for IP, content, and brand professionals worldwide,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mark-Full-Photo.jpg?resize=1200,801" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When Mark Lee was a law student at Harvard, a trademark class exposed him to the staggering scale of counterfeiting, an illicit industry worth more than $3 trillion annually, and set him on an unexpected path to entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

Up to 40% of images captured by the observatory within its first 10 years of operation will be marred by their sunlight-reflecting streaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meredith Rawls, a research scientist at the telescope’s flagship observation project, Vera Rubin’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, is one of the experts tasked with protecting Rubin’s science mission from the satellite blight.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-9f9513be-7fff-adbc-e573-265de5f3d249"&gt;For pregnant women, ultrasounds are an informative (and sometimes necessary) procedure. They typically produce two-dimensional black-and-white scans of fetuses that can reveal key insights, including biological sex, approximate size, and abnormalities like heart issues or cleft lip. If your doctor wants a closer look, they may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields to capture images that can be combined to create a 3D view of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MRIs aren’t a catch-all, though; the 3D scans are difficult for doctors to interpret well enough to diagnose problems because our visual system is not accustomed to processing 3D volumetric scans (in other words, a wrap-around look that also shows us the inner structures of a subject). Enter machine learning, which could help model a fetus’s development more clearly and accurately from data — although no such algorithm has been able to model their somewhat random movements and various body shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That is, until a new approach called “Fetal SMPL” from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), and Harvard Medical School presented clinicians with a more detailed picture of fetal health. It was adapted from “SMPL” (Skinned Multi-Person Linear model), a 3D model developed in computer graphics to capture adult body shapes and poses, as a way to represent fetal body shapes and poses accurately. Fetal SMPL was then trained on 20,000 MRI volumes to predict the location and size of a fetus and create sculpture-like 3D representations. Inside each model is a skeleton with 23 articulated joints called a “kinematic tree,” which the system uses to pose and move like the fetuses it saw during training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extensive, real-world scans that Fetal SMPL learned from helped it develop pinpoint accuracy. Imagine stepping into a stranger’s footprint while blindfolded, and not only does it fit perfectly, but you correctly guess what shoe they wore — similarly, the tool closely matched the position and size of fetuses in MRI frames it hadn’t seen before. Fetal SMPL was only misaligned by an average of about 3.1 millimeters, a gap smaller than a single grain of rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach could enable doctors to precisely measure things like the size of a baby’s head or abdomen and compare these metrics with healthy fetuses at the same age. Fetal SMPL has demonstrated its clinical potential in early tests, where it achieved accurate alignment results on a small group of real-world scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It can be challenging to estimate the shape and pose of a fetus because they’re crammed into the tight confines of the uterus,” says lead author, MIT PhD student, and CSAIL researcher Yingcheng Liu SM ’21. “Our approach overcomes this challenge using a system of interconnected bones under the surface of the 3D model, which represent the fetal body and its motions realistically. Then, it relies on a coordinate descent algorithm to make a prediction, essentially alternating between guessing pose and shape from tricky data until it finds a reliable estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In utero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetal SMPL was tested on shape and pose accuracy against the closest baseline the researchers could find: a system that models infant growth called&amp;nbsp;“SMIL.” Since babies out of the womb are larger than fetuses, the team shrank those models by 75 percent to level the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system outperformed this baseline on a dataset of fetal MRIs between the gestational ages of 24 and 37 weeks taken at Boston Children’s Hospital. Fetal SMPL was able to recreate real scans more precisely, as its models closely lined up with real MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The method was efficient at lining up their models to images, only needing three iterations to arrive at a reasonable alignment. In an experiment that counted how many incorrect guesses Fetal SMPL had made before arriving at a final estimate, its accuracy plateaued from the fourth step onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have just begun testing their system in the real world, where it produced similarly accurate models in initial clinical tests. While these results are promising, the team notes that they’ll need to apply their results to larger populations, different gestational ages, and a variety of disease cases to better understand the system’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only skin deep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Liu also notes that their system only helps analyze what doctors can see on the surface of a fetus, since only bone-like structures lie beneath the skin of the models. To better monitor babies’ internal health, such as liver, lung, and muscle development, the team intends to make their tool volumetric, modeling the fetus’s inner anatomy from scans. Such upgrades would make the models more human-like, but the current version of Fetal SMPL already presents a precise (and unique) upgrade to 3D fetal health analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study introduces a method specifically designed for fetal MRI that effectively captures fetal movements, enhancing the assessment of fetal development and health,” says Kiho Im, Harvard Medical School associate professor of pediatrics and staff scientist in the Division of Newborn Medicine at BCH’s Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center. Im, who was not involved with the paper, adds that this approach “will not only improve the diagnostic utility of fetal MRI, but also provide insights into the early functional development of the fetal brain in relation to body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This work reaches a pioneering milestone by extending parametric surface human body models for the earliest shapes of human life: fetuses,” says Sergi Pujades, an associate professor at University Grenoble Alpes, who wasn’t involved in the research. “It allows us to detangle the shape and motion of a human, which has already proven to be key in understanding how adult body shape relates to metabolic conditions and how infant motion relates to neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, the fact that the fetal model stems from, and is compatible with, the adult (SMPL) and infant (SMIL) body models, will allow us to study human shape and pose evolution over long periods of time. This is an unprecedented opportunity to further quantify how human shape growth and motion are affected by different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu wrote the paper with three CSAIL members: Peiqi Wang SM ’22, PhD ’25; MIT PhD student Sebastian Diaz; and senior author Polina Golland, the Sunlin and Priscilla Chou Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a principal investigator in MIT CSAIL, and the leader of the Medical Vision Group. BCH assistant professor of pediatrics Esra Abaci Turk, Inria researcher Benjamin Billot, and Harvard Medical School professor of pediatrics and professor of radiology Patricia Ellen Grant are also authors on the paper. This work was supported, in part, by the National Institutes of Health and the MIT CSAIL-Wistron Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers will present their work at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in September.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike most traditional systems in this space that depend largely on machine vision, APAS uses a radar-first approach, in combination with other sensing technologies. It connects directly to a ship’s radar and streamlines data so it can be used to alert a ship’s human crew if necessary during a journey. APAS is designed to support mariners, reduce cognitive load, and improve situational awareness, yet keep human judgement at the centre of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff Douglass, CEO of Mythos AI, said, “Our goal isn’t to replace the crew. It’s to equip them with next-generation capabilities. By integrating our proprietary radar perception, machine vision, and intelligent alerting with the vessel’s dynamics, APAS transforms complex situations into clear, actionable decisions, enhancing safety and operational resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CB Pacific was chosen for testing due to its predictable routes and reliable Furuno radar. The trial follows the first installation of APAS on a Southern Devall towboat on the Mississippi River in August 2025, and will be a year-long experiment aiming to introduce next-gen bridge intelligence to commercial shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Partnering with lomarlabs and CB Tankers enables APAS to capture and retain the expertise of master mariners and the navigational norms of ports worldwide […] We are validating performance at scale and laying the groundwork for broader fleet-wide adoption,” Douglass said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APAS system’s year-long trial will help ensure it functions safely and effectively in real-world conditions, and will check it can follow international regulations compliant with the COLREG (Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CB Tankers is part of the Lomar group of companies. Managing director of lomarlabs, Stylianos Papageorgiou, said progress in maritime AI only comes from operational testing. “Real innovation doesn’t happen in pitch decks. It happens in real-time operations, port calls, dry docks, and sea trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increased interest from the defence sector, the APAS project represents a step toward adoption of AI-driven navigation systems in commercial and strategic maritime operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “The M/T Carry on the Baltic Sea” by Mustang Joe is marked with CC0 1.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The trial follows the first installation of APAS on a Southern Devall towboat on the Mississippi River in August 2025, and will be a year-long experiment aiming to introduce next-gen bridge intelligence to commercial shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Partnering with lomarlabs and CB Tankers enables APAS to capture and retain the expertise of master mariners and the navigational norms of ports worldwide […] We are validating performance at scale and laying the groundwork for broader fleet-wide adoption,” Douglass said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APAS system’s year-long trial will help ensure it functions safely and effectively in real-world conditions, and will check it can follow international regulations compliant with the COLREG (Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CB Tankers is part of the Lomar group of companies. Managing director of lomarlabs, Stylianos Papageorgiou, said progress in maritime AI only comes from operational testing. “Real innovation doesn’t happen in pitch decks. It happens in real-time operations, port calls, dry docks, and sea trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increased interest from the defence sector, the APAS project represents a step toward adoption of AI-driven navigation systems in commercial and strategic maritime operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “The M/T Carry on the Baltic Sea” by Mustang Joe is marked with CC0 1.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Monday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation ruled that semiconductor giant Nvidia was in violation of the country’s antitrust regulations, as first reported by Bloomberg. The ruling was in reference to Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a computer networking supplier, for $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Nvidia spokesperson supplied the following statement, “We comply with the law in all respects. We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;China didn’t announce any consequences tied to its findings and will continue to investigate. Still, the ruling is likely to cast a pall over ongoing tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China, currently taking place in Madrid. While these trade discussions aren’t specifically about semiconductors, the question of Chinese access to Nvidia chips is a major point of contention between the two regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The outgoing Biden administration announced its AI Diffusion Rule back in January that was meant to restrict U.S.-made AI chips to many countries, with further restrictions specifically for China and other adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the U.S. Department of Commerce formally repealed Biden’s AI rule in May, the future of AI chip exports to China remains in flux. The Trump administration slapped licensing agreements on chips heading to China in April. A few months later, in July, these companies were given the green light to start selling these chips again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just a few weeks after that the country struck a deal requiring companies selling chips to China to give the U.S. a 15% cut of the revenue made on those sales. China has discouraged firms from buying Nvidia chips and, as of a recent earnings call, none of the company’s chips have made it through the new export process.&lt;/p&gt;

The company says its new model, called GPT-5-Codex, spends its “thinking” time more dynamically than previous models, and could spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours on a coding task. As a result, it performs better on agentic coding benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new model is now rolling out in Codex products — which can be accessed via a terminal, IDE, GitHub, or ChatGPT — to all ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise users. OpenAI says it plans to make the model available to API customers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update is part of OpenAI’s effort to make Codex more competitive with other AI coding products, such as Claude Code, Anysphere’s Cursor, or Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot. The market for AI coding tools has become much more crowded in the last year, as a result of intense user demand. Cursor surpassed $500 million in ARR earlier in 2025 and Windsurf, a similar code editor, was the subject of a chaotic acquisition attempt that saw its team split between Google and Cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that GPT-5-Codex outperforms GPT-5 on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring agentic coding abilities, as well as a benchmark measuring performance on code refactoring tasks from large, established repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3045900" height="455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-9.50.01AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;(Credit: OpenAI)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also says it trained GPT-5-Codex for conducting code reviews, and asked experience software engineers to evaluate the model’s review comments. The engineers reportedly found GPT-5-Codex to submit fewer incorrect comments, while adding more “high-impact comments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a briefing, OpenAI’s Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said that much of the increased performance was thanks to GPT-5-Codex’s dynamic “thinking abilities.” Users may be familiar with GPT-5’s router in ChatGPT, which directs queries to different models based on the complexity of a task. Embiricos said GPT-5-Codex works similarly, but has no router under the hood, and can adjust for how long to work on a task in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Embiricos says this is an advantage compared to a router, which decides how much computational power and time to use on a problem at the outset. Instead, GPT-5-Codex can decide five minutes into a problem that it needs to spend another hour. Embiricos said he’s seen the model take upwards of seven hours in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

The company says its new model, called GPT-5-Codex, spends its “thinking” time more dynamically than previous models, and could spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours on a coding task. As a result, it performs better on agentic coding benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new model is now rolling out in Codex products — which can be accessed via a terminal, IDE, GitHub, or ChatGPT — to all ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise users. OpenAI says it plans to make the model available to API customers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update is part of OpenAI’s effort to make Codex more competitive with other AI coding products, such as Claude Code, Anysphere’s Cursor, or Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot. The market for AI coding tools has become much more crowded in the last year, as a result of intense user demand. Cursor surpassed $500 million in ARR earlier in 2025 and Windsurf, a similar code editor, was the subject of a chaotic acquisition attempt that saw its team split between Google and Cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that GPT-5-Codex outperforms GPT-5 on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring agentic coding abilities, as well as a benchmark measuring performance on code refactoring tasks from large, established repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also says it trained GPT-5-Codex for conducting code reviews, and asked experience software engineers to evaluate the model’s review comments. The engineers reportedly found GPT-5-Codex to submit fewer incorrect comments, while adding more “high-impact comments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a briefing, OpenAI’s Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said that much of the increased performance was thanks to GPT-5-Codex’s dynamic “thinking abilities.” Users may be familiar with GPT-5’s router in ChatGPT, which directs queries to different models based on the complexity of a task. Embiricos said GPT-5-Codex works similarly, but has no router under the hood, and can adjust for how long to work on a task in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Embiricos says this is an advantage compared to a router, which decides how much computational power and time to use on a problem at the outset. Instead, GPT-5-Codex can decide five minutes into a problem that it needs to spend another hour. Embiricos said he’s seen the model take upwards of seven hours in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
