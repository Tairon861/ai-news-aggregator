On the other end was Joe Biden’s voice, urging Democrats to “save your vote” by skipping the primary. It sounded authentic, but it wasn’t. The call was a fake, generated by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the technology behind that hoax looks quaint. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora now make it possible to create convincing synthetic videos with astonishing ease. AI can be used to fabricate messages from politicians and celebrities—even entire news clips—in minutes. The fear that elections could be overwhelmed by realistic fake media has gone mainstream—and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s only half the story. The deeper threat isn’t that AI can just imitate people—it’s that it can actively persuade people. And new research published this week shows just how powerful that persuasion can be. In two large peer-reviewed studies, AI chatbots shifted voters’ views by a substantial margin, far more than traditional political advertising tends to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, we will see the rise of AI that can personalize arguments, test what works, and quietly reshape political views at scale. That shift—from imitation to active persuasion—should worry us deeply.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The challenge is that modern AI doesn’t just copy voices or faces; it holds conversations, reads emotions, and tailors its tone to persuade. And it can now command other AIs—directing image, video, and voice models to generate the most convincing content for each target. Putting these pieces together, it’s not hard to imagine how one could build a coordinated persuasion machine. One AI might write the message, another could create the visuals, another could distribute it across platforms and watch what works. No humans required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decade ago, mounting an effective online influence campaign typically meant deploying armies of people running fake accounts and meme farms. Now that kind of work can be automated—cheaply and invisibly. The same technology that powers customer service bots and tutoring apps can be repurposed to nudge political opinions or amplify a government’s preferred narrative. And the persuasion doesn’t have to be confined to ads or robocalls. It can be woven into the tools people already use every day—social media feeds, language learning apps, dating platforms, or even voice assistants built and sold by parties trying to influence the American public. That kind of influence could come from malicious actors using the APIs of popular AI tools people already rely on, or from entirely new apps built with the persuasion baked in from the start.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And it’s affordable. For less than a million dollars, anyone can generate personalized, conversational messages for every registered voter in America. The math isn’t complicated. Assume 10 brief exchanges per person—around 2,700 tokens of text—and price them at current rates for ChatGPT’s API. Even with a population of 174 million registered voters, the total still comes in under $1 million. The 80,000 swing voters who decided the 2016 election could be targeted for less than $3,000.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although this is a challenge in elections across the world, the stakes for the United States are especially high, given the scale of its elections and the attention they attract from foreign actors. If the US doesn’t move fast, the next presidential election in 2028, or even the midterms in 2026, could be won by whoever automates persuasion first.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2028 threat&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there have been indications that the threat AI poses to elections is overblown, a growing body of research suggests the situation could be changing. Recent studies have shown that GPT-4 can exceed the persuasive capabilities of communications experts when generating statements on polarizing US political topics, and it is more persuasive than non-expert humans two-thirds of the time when debating real voters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two major studies published yesterday extend those findings to real election contexts in the United States, Canada, Poland, and the United Kingdom, showing that brief chatbot conversations can move voters’ attitudes by up to 10 percentage points, with US participant opinions shifting nearly four times more than it did in response to tested 2016 and 2020 political ads. And when models were explicitly optimized for persuasion, the shift soared to 25 percentage points—an almost unfathomable difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While previously confined to well-resourced companies, modern large language models are becoming increasingly easy to use. Major AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google wrap their frontier models in usage policies, automated safety filters, and account-level monitoring, and they do sometimes suspend users who violate those rules. But those restrictions apply only to traffic that goes through their platforms; they don’t extend to the rapidly growing ecosystem of open-source and open-weight models, which&amp;nbsp; can be downloaded by anyone with an internet connection. Though they’re usually smaller and less capable than their commercial counterparts, research has shown with careful prompting and fine-tuning, these models can now match the performance of leading commercial systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this means that actors, whether well-resourced organizations or grassroots collectives, have a clear path to deploying politically persuasive AI at scale. Early demonstrations have already occurred elsewhere in the world. In India’s 2024 general election, tens of millions of dollars were reportedly spent on AI to segment voters, identify swing voters, deliver personalized messaging through robocalls and chatbots, and more. In Taiwan, officials and researchers have documented China-linked operations using generative AI to produce more subtle disinformation, ranging from deepfakes to language model outputs that are biased toward messaging approved by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s only a matter of time before this technology comes to US elections—if it hasn’t already. Foreign adversaries are well positioned to move first. China, Russia, Iran, and others already maintain networks of troll farms, bot accounts, and covert influence operators. Paired with open-source language models that generate fluent and localized political content, those operations can be supercharged. In fact, there is no longer a need for human operators who understand the language or the context. With light tuning, a model can impersonate a neighborhood organizer, a union rep, or a disaffected parent without a person ever setting foot in the country. Political campaigns themselves will likely be close behind. Every major operation already segments voters, tests messages, and optimizes delivery. AI lowers the cost of doing all that. Instead of poll-testing a slogan, a campaign can generate hundreds of arguments, deliver them one on one, and watch in real time which ones shift opinions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The underlying fact is simple: Persuasion has become effective and cheap. Campaigns, PACs, foreign actors, advocacy groups, and opportunists are all playing on the same field—and there are very few rules.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The policy vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most policymakers have not caught up. Over the past several years, legislators in the US have focused on deepfakes but have ignored the wider persuasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Foreign governments have begun to take the problem more seriously. The European Union’s 2024 AI Act classifies election-related persuasion as a “high-risk” use case. Any system designed to influence voting behavior is now subject to strict requirements. Administrative tools, like AI systems used to plan campaign events or optimize logistics, are exempt. However, tools that aim to shape political beliefs or voting decisions are not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States has so far refused to draw any meaningful lines. There are no binding rules about what constitutes a political influence operation, no external standards to guide enforcement, and no shared infrastructure for tracking AI-generated persuasion across platforms. The federal and state governments have gestured toward regulation—the Federal Election Commission is applying old fraud provisions, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed narrow disclosure rules for broadcast ads, and a handful of states have passed deepfake laws—but these efforts are piecemeal and leave most digital campaigning untouched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, the responsibility for detecting and dismantling covert campaigns has been left almost entirely to private companies, each with its own rules, incentives, and blind spots. Google and Meta have adopted policies requiring disclosure when political ads are generated using AI. X has remained largely silent on this, while TikTok bans all paid political advertising. However, these rules, modest as they are, cover only the sliver of content that is bought and publicly displayed. They say almost nothing about the unpaid, private persuasion campaigns that may matter most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To their credit, some firms have begun publishing periodic threat reports identifying covert influence campaigns. Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and Google have all disclosed takedowns of inauthentic accounts. However, these efforts are voluntary and not subject to independent auditing. Most important, none of this prevents determined actors from bypassing platform restrictions altogether with open-source models and off-platform infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a real strategy would look like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United States does not need to ban AI from political life. Some applications may even strengthen democracy. A well-designed candidate chatbot could help voters understand where the candidate stands on key issues, answer questions directly, or translate complex policy into plain language. Research has even shown that AI can reduce belief in conspiracy theories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, there are a few things the United States should do to protect against the threat of AI persuasion. First, it must guard against foreign-made political technology with built-in persuasion capabilities. Adversarial political technology could take the form of a foreign-produced video game where in-game characters echo political talking points, a social media platform whose recommendation algorithm tilts toward certain narratives, or a language learning app that slips subtle messages into daily lessons. Evaluations, such as the Center for AI Standards and Innovation’s recent analysis of DeepSeek, should focus on identifying and assessing AI products—particularly from countries like China, Russia, or Iran—before they are widely deployed. This effort would require coordination among intelligence agencies, regulators, and platforms to spot and address risks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should lead in shaping the rules around AI-driven persuasion. That includes tightening access to computing power for large-scale foreign persuasion efforts, since many actors will either rent existing models or lease the GPU capacity to train their own. It also means establishing clear technical standards—through governments, standards bodies, and voluntary industry commitments—for how AI systems capable of generating political content should operate, especially during sensitive election periods. And domestically, the United States needs to determine what kinds of disclosures should apply to AI-generated political messaging while navigating First Amendment concerns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, foreign adversaries will try to evade these safeguards—using offshore servers, open-source models, or intermediaries in third countries. That is why the United States also needs a foreign policy response. Multilateral election integrity agreements should codify a basic norm: States that deploy AI systems to manipulate another country’s electorate risk coordinated sanctions and public exposure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doing so will likely involve building shared monitoring infrastructure, aligning disclosure and provenance standards, and being prepared to conduct coordinated takedowns of cross-border persuasion campaigns—because many of these operations are already moving into opaque spaces where our current detection tools are weak. The US should also push to make election manipulation part of the broader agenda at forums like the G7 and OECD, ensuring that threats related to AI persuasion are treated not as isolated tech problems but as collective security challenges.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the task of securing elections cannot fall to the United States alone. A functioning radar system for AI persuasion will require partnerships with our partners and allies. Influence campaigns are rarely confined by borders, and open-source models and offshore servers will always exist. The goal is not to eliminate them but to raise the cost of misuse and shrink the window in which they can operate undetected across jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The era of AI persuasion is just around the corner, and America’s adversaries are prepared. In the US, on the other hand, the laws are out of date, the guardrails too narrow, and the oversight largely voluntary. If the last decade was shaped by viral lies and doctored videos, the next will be shaped by a subtler force: messages that sound reasonable, familiar, and just persuasive enough to change hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For China, Russia, Iran, and others, exploiting America’s open information ecosystem is a strategic opportunity. We need a strategy that treats AI persuasion not as a distant threat but as a present fact. That means soberly assessing the risks to democratic discourse, putting real standards in place, and building a technical and legal infrastructure around them. Because if we wait until we can see it happening, it will already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tal Feldman is a JD candidate at Yale Law School who focuses on technology and national security.

The US should also push to make election manipulation part of the broader agenda at forums like the G7 and OECD, ensuring that threats related to AI persuasion are treated not as isolated tech problems but as collective security challenges.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the task of securing elections cannot fall to the United States alone. A functioning radar system for AI persuasion will require partnerships with our partners and allies. Influence campaigns are rarely confined by borders, and open-source models and offshore servers will always exist. The goal is not to eliminate them but to raise the cost of misuse and shrink the window in which they can operate undetected across jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The era of AI persuasion is just around the corner, and America’s adversaries are prepared. In the US, on the other hand, the laws are out of date, the guardrails too narrow, and the oversight largely voluntary. If the last decade was shaped by viral lies and doctored videos, the next will be shaped by a subtler force: messages that sound reasonable, familiar, and just persuasive enough to change hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For China, Russia, Iran, and others, exploiting America’s open information ecosystem is a strategic opportunity. We need a strategy that treats AI persuasion not as a distant threat but as a present fact. That means soberly assessing the risks to democratic discourse, putting real standards in place, and building a technical and legal infrastructure around them. Because if we wait until we can see it happening, it will already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tal Feldman is a JD candidate at Yale Law School who focuses on technology and national security.

Makeup and then genetic optimization,” exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads. To his mind, one should be as accessible as the other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nucleus is a young, attention-seeking genetic software company that says it can analyze genetic tests on IVF embryos to score them for 2,000 traits and disease risks, letting parents pick some and reject others.

 &lt;p&gt;I agreed to meet Sadeghi that night in the station under a banner that read, “IQ is 50% genetic.” He appeared in a puffer jacket and told me the campaign would soon spread to 1,000 train cars. Not long ago, this was a secretive technology to whisper about at Silicon Valley dinner parties. But now? “Look at the stairs. The entire subway is genetic optimization. We’re bringing it mainstream,” he said. “I mean, like, we are normalizing it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Normalizing what, exactly? The ability to choose embryos on the basis of predicted traits could lead to healthier people. But the traits mentioned in the subway—height and IQ—focus the public’s mind toward cosmetic choices and even naked discrimination. “I think people are going to read this and start realizing: Wow, it is now an option that I can pick. I can have a taller, smarter, healthier baby,” says Sadeghi.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, I learned from Sadeghi that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had objected to parts of the campaign. The metro agency, for instance, did not let Nucleus run ads saying “Have a girl” and “Have a boy,” even though it’s very easy to identify the sex of an embryo using a genetic test. The reason was an MTA policy that forbids using government-owned infrastructure to promote “invidious discrimination” against protected classes, which include race, religion and biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since 2023, New York City has also included height and weight in its anti-discrimination law, the idea being to “root out bias” related to body size in housing and in public spaces. So I’m not sure why the MTA let Nucleus declare that height is 80% genetic. (The MTA advertising department didn’t respond to questions.) Perhaps it’s because the statement is a factual claim, not an explicit call to action. But we all know what to do: Pick the tall one and leave shorty in the IVF freezer, never to be born.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Microsoft’s attempt in the form of Windows Mobile was reaching the end of its road by 2010, and despite Apple’s iOS/iPadOS and macOS moving very slowly towards one another for the last few years, Cupertino has not yet reached the fabled goal of the-one-OS-to-rule-them-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google’s big play to merge ChromeOS and Android into a unified PC platform (with the anglicised codename Aluminium OS) is gradually taking shape. Android-powered laptops are planned for released in 2026, and the company wants to put its LLMs at the centre of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware procurement decisions may be in step with company AI strategy in the enterprise, therefore, in the coming year. The prospect of chromebook-style devices and an accompanying lower price tag will be attractive both to organisations considering their next round of machine refreshes, and strategists who want to put AI at the heart of their employees’ daily work could. Soon, they might have a solution in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s early days in the development of the converged device at Google, but the company is well known for both floating ideas that don’t get far and abandoning technologies it can’t monetise effectively enough. Unlike some of the company’s projects that may stem from its ‘20%’ policy (employees at Google are encouraged to dedicate 20% of their time to moonshot projects), the substantial Android development community and Google’s policy of putting Gemini front-and-centre may be the accelerant the new, converged operating system needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android’s existing AI capabilities like the Magic Editor for photos, audio transcription and summarisation would port very well to the workplace desktop. However, if Google wants to assuage the fears of security professionals, it may have to rely on local, small models for AI processing, rather than reaching out to cloud instances of Gemini for the required compute power. That puts into question the continuation of one of the chromebook range’s big selling points – its low price compared to fully-fledged workstations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a delicate balance the company needs to strike. Forcing users into an AI-centric workflow hasn’t played well for Microsoft: note the furore around Recall and the muted response to its much-reduced offspring that has sprung out of Copilot Labs. What Google needs is a killer AI feature that benefits the enterprise, and that may or may not be something that’s aimed at users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that the addition of Gemini to Google Workspace has done wonders for the platform in terms of its competitiveness with Office 365 – despite a significant price hike earlier this year – driven in some part by new features like live translation in Google Meet and AI responses available in Gmail. Users &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find some AI tools useful, but it may be becoming apparent that user-facing AI is a useful addition to existing workflows, rather than a catalyst that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If placing Gemini or Gemini Nano at the heart of the new operating system, therefore, it may be that Google is looking to offer value to different parts of the enterprise from the daily tasks users tackle. &lt;i&gt;Android Authority&lt;/i&gt; suggests smart power management, device provisioning, and contextual awareness in accessing enterprise resources may be on the table. It’s difficult to see how these elements would be a game-changer for procurement teams, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has many problems to solve at a deeper level, like compatibility with peripherals, OS-level drivers, and the necssary changes to the Android GUI to make it a great experience for end users wielding mouse and keyboard. But given enough effort and investment (something the company does not lack) these are issues that can be surmounted relatively easily. A thriving app ecosystem will ensure that the necessary tools are if not immediately available, could be made so with minimum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the success of Aluminium OS will depend on Google’s ability to offer a platform that solves tangible problems and integrates into existing workflows. Google sees AI in the form of Gemini (or localised Gemini Nano instance) powering a platform that offers integrated problem-solving. Hitting that target will generate demand, and a lower price per machine could be the decider for procurement teams.

Microsoft’s attempt in the form of Windows Mobile was reaching the end of its road by 2010, and despite Apple’s iOS/iPadOS and macOS moving very slowly towards one another for the last few years, Cupertino has not yet reached the fabled goal of the-one-OS-to-rule-them-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google’s big play to merge ChromeOS and Android into a unified PC platform (with the anglicised codename Aluminium OS) is gradually taking shape. Android-powered laptops are planned for released in 2026, and the company wants to put its LLMs at the centre of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware procurement decisions may be in step with company AI strategy in the enterprise, therefore, in the coming year. The prospect of chromebook-style devices and an accompanying lower price tag will be attractive both to organisations considering their next round of machine refreshes, and strategists who want to put AI at the heart of their employees’ daily work could. Soon, they might have a solution in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s early days in the development of the converged device at Google, but the company is well known for both floating ideas that don’t get far and abandoning technologies it can’t monetise effectively enough. Unlike some of the company’s projects that may stem from its ‘20%’ policy (employees at Google are encouraged to dedicate 20% of their time to moonshot projects), the substantial Android development community and Google’s policy of putting Gemini front-and-centre may be the accelerant the new, converged operating system needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android’s existing AI capabilities like the Magic Editor for photos, audio transcription and summarisation would port very well to the workplace desktop. However, if Google wants to assuage the fears of security professionals, it may have to rely on local, small models for AI processing, rather than reaching out to cloud instances of Gemini for the required compute power. That puts into question the continuation of one of the chromebook range’s big selling points – its low price compared to fully-fledged workstations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a delicate balance the company needs to strike. Forcing users into an AI-centric workflow hasn’t played well for Microsoft: note the furore around Recall and the muted response to its much-reduced offspring that has sprung out of Copilot Labs. What Google needs is a killer AI feature that benefits the enterprise, and that may or may not be something that’s aimed at users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that the addition of Gemini to Google Workspace has done wonders for the platform in terms of its competitiveness with Office 365 – despite a significant price hike earlier this year – driven in some part by new features like live translation in Google Meet and AI responses available in Gmail. Users &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find some AI tools useful, but it may be becoming apparent that user-facing AI is a useful addition to existing workflows, rather than a catalyst that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If placing Gemini or Gemini Nano at the heart of the new operating system, therefore, it may be that Google is looking to offer value to different parts of the enterprise from the daily tasks users tackle. &lt;i&gt;Android Authority&lt;/i&gt; suggests smart power management, device provisioning, and contextual awareness in accessing enterprise resources may be on the table. It’s difficult to see how these elements would be a game-changer for procurement teams, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has many problems to solve at a deeper level, like compatibility with peripherals, OS-level drivers, and the necssary changes to the Android GUI to make it a great experience for end users wielding mouse and keyboard. But given enough effort and investment (something the company does not lack) these are issues that can be surmounted relatively easily. A thriving app ecosystem will ensure that the necessary tools are if not immediately available, could be made so with minimum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the success of Aluminium OS will depend on Google’s ability to offer a platform that solves tangible problems and integrates into existing workflows. Google sees AI in the form of Gemini (or localised Gemini Nano instance) powering a platform that offers integrated problem-solving. Hitting that target will generate demand, and a lower price per machine could be the decider for procurement teams. If Google gets it right, it could repeat the success it experienced in the education market with the original chromebook project, and there could be a substantial shift by enterprise fleets to Aluminium OS and Google Workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are big gains to be made for a company that dominates the mobile market worldwide and makes serious inroads into the enterprise workstation market.

It amazed the world and ignited unprecedented investment and excitement in AI. Today, ChatGPT is still a toddler, but public sentiment around the AI boom has turned sharply negative. The shift began when OpenAI released GPT-5 this summer&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-old-models-to-chatgpt-as-sam-altman-admits-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout"&gt; &lt;u&gt;to mixed reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mostly from casual users who, unsurprisingly, judged the system by its surface flaws rather than its underlying capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, pundits and influencers have declared that AI progress is slowing, that scaling has “hit the wall,” and that the entire field is just another tech bubble inflated by blusterous hype. In fact, many influencers have latched onto the dismissive phrase “AI slop” to diminish the amazing images, documents, videos and code that frontier AI models generate on command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective is not just wrong, it is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder, where were all these “experts” on irrational technology bubbles when electric scooter startups were touted as a transportation revolution and cartoon NFTs were being auctioned for millions? They were probably too busy buying&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/landlords-property-taxes-and-zoning-permits-in-a-virtual-world"&gt; &lt;u&gt;worthless land in the metaverse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or adding to their positions in GameStop. But when it comes to the AI boom, which is easily the most significant technological and economic transformation agent of the last 25 years, journalists and influencers can’t write the word “slop” enough times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Doth we protest too much?&lt;/i&gt;  After all, by any objective measure AI is wildly more capable than the vast majority of&lt;a href="https://cdn.governance.ai/Forecasting_AI_Progress-_Evidence_from_a_Survey_of_Machine_Learning_Researchers.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;computer scientists predicted only five years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it is still improving at a surprising pace. The impressive leap demonstrated by Gemini 3 is only the latest example. At the same time, McKinsey recently reported that 20% of organizations already derive tangible value from genAI. Also, a&lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/163f0300-72ea-4a61-b636-2510a341c36a?j=eyJ1IjoicXYwciJ9.c447zMM6uTTeDcPlwkrNsJgBndcJY5zgU0jzwyQ9DCk"&gt; &lt;u&gt;recent survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Deloitte indicates that 85% of organizations boosted their AI investment in 2025, and 91% plan to increase again in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t fit the “bubble” narrative and the dismissive “slop” language. As a computer scientist and research engineer who began working with neural networks back in 1989 and tracked progress through cold winters and hot booms ever since, I find myself amazed almost every day by the rapidly increasing capabilities of frontier AI models. When I talk with other professionals in the field, I hear similar sentiments. If anything,&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;the rate of AI advancement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves many experts feeling overwhelmed and frankly somewhat scared.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The dangers of AI denial&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is the public buying into the narrative that AI is faltering, that the output is “slop,” and that the AI boom lacks authentic use cases? Personally, I believe it’s because we’ve fallen into a collective state of &lt;i&gt;AI denial&lt;/i&gt;, latching onto the narratives we want to hear in the face of strong evidence to the contrary. Denial is the first stage of grief and thus a reasonable reaction to the very disturbing prospect that we humans may soon lose&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/like-it-or-not-ai-is-learning-how-to-influence-you"&gt; &lt;u&gt;cognitive supremacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here on planet earth. In other words, the overblown AI bubble narrative is a societal defense mechanism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I get it. I’ve been warning about the&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;destabilizing risks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-happens-the-day-after-superintelligence"&gt; &lt;u&gt;demoralizing impact of superintelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for well over a decade, and I too feel AI is getting too smart too fast. The fact is, we are rapidly headed towards a future where widely available AI systems will be able to outperform most humans in most cognitive tasks, solving problems faster, more accurately and yes, &lt;i&gt;more creatively&lt;/i&gt; than any individual can. I emphasize “creativity” because AI denialists often insist that certain human qualities (particularly creativity and emotional intelligence&lt;i&gt;) &lt;/i&gt;will always be out of reach of AI systems. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the creativity front, today’s AI models can generate content faster and with more variation than any individual human. Critics argue that true creativity requires inner motivation. I resonate with that argument but find it circular — we&amp;#x27;re defining creativity based on how we experience it rather than the quality, originality or usefulness of the output. Also, we just don’t know if AI systems will develop internal drives or a sense of agency. Either way, if AI can produce original work that rivals most human professionals,&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;the impact on creative jobs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will still be quite devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The AI manipulation problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our human edge around emotional intelligence is even more precarious. It’s likely that AI will soon be able to read our emotions faster and more accurately than any human,&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16075-2_39"&gt; &lt;u&gt;tracking subtle cues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in our micro-expressions, vocal patterns, posture, gaze and even breathing. And as we integrate AI assistants into our phones, glasses and other wearable devices, these systems will monitor our emotional reactions throughout our day,&lt;a href="https://www.iiis.org/CDs2023/CD2023Summer/papers/HA408FU.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;building predictive models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of our behaviors. Without strict regulation, which is increasingly unlikely, these predictive models could be used to target us with&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11748"&gt; &lt;u&gt;individually optimized influence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that maximizes persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is called the&lt;a href="https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/elgar-concise-encyclopedia-of-artificial-intelligence-and-the-law-9781035336890.html"&gt; &lt;u&gt;AI manipulation problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it suggests that emotional intelligence may not give humanity an advantage. In fact, it could be a significant weakness, fostering an&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;asymmetric dynamic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where AI systems can read us with&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9965661/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;superhuman accuracy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while we can’t read AI at all. When you talk with photorealistic AI agents (and&lt;a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/1223362"&gt; &lt;u&gt;you will&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) you’ll see a smiling façade designed to appear warm, empathic and trustworthy. It will look and feel human, but that’s just an illusion, and it could easily&lt;a href="https://openaccess.cms-conferences.org/publications/book/978-1-958651-75-9/article/978-1-958651-75-9_13"&gt; &lt;u&gt;sway your perspectives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After all, our emotional reactions to faces are&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008204002151"&gt; &lt;u&gt;visceral reflexes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shaped by millions of years of evolution on a planet where every interactive human face we encountered was actually human. Soon, that will no longer be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are rapidly heading toward a world where many of the faces we encounter will belong to AI agents&lt;a href="https://www.privacylost.org/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;hiding behind digital facades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, these “&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9965661/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;virtual spokespeople&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” could easily have appearances that are designed for each of us based on our prior reactions – whatever gets us to best let down our guard. And yet many insist that AI is just another tech cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is wishful thinking. The massive investment pouring into AI isn’t driven by hype — it’s driven by the expectation that AI will permeate every aspect of daily life, embodied as intelligent actors we engage throughout our day. These systems will&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/enter-the-whisperverse-how-ai-voice-agents-will-guide-us-through-our-days"&gt; &lt;u&gt;assist us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, teach us and&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;influence us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They will reshape our lives, and it will happen faster than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we are not witnessing an AI bubble filling with empty gas. We are watching a new planet form, a molten world rapidly taking shape, and it will solidify into&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;a new AI-powered society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Denial will not stop this. It will only make us less prepared for the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/louisrosenberg/bio"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Louis Rosenberg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; is an early pioneer of augmented reality and a longtime AI researcher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, ChatGPT was born.

But when it comes to the AI boom, which is easily the most significant technological and economic transformation agent of the last 25 years, journalists and influencers can’t write the word “slop” enough times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Doth we protest too much?&lt;/i&gt;  After all, by any objective measure AI is wildly more capable than the vast majority of&lt;a href="https://cdn.governance.ai/Forecasting_AI_Progress-_Evidence_from_a_Survey_of_Machine_Learning_Researchers.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;computer scientists predicted only five years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it is still improving at a surprising pace. The impressive leap demonstrated by Gemini 3 is only the latest example. At the same time, McKinsey recently reported that 20% of organizations already derive tangible value from genAI. Also, a&lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/163f0300-72ea-4a61-b636-2510a341c36a?j=eyJ1IjoicXYwciJ9.c447zMM6uTTeDcPlwkrNsJgBndcJY5zgU0jzwyQ9DCk"&gt; &lt;u&gt;recent survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Deloitte indicates that 85% of organizations boosted their AI investment in 2025, and 91% plan to increase again in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t fit the “bubble” narrative and the dismissive “slop” language. As a computer scientist and research engineer who began working with neural networks back in 1989 and tracked progress through cold winters and hot booms ever since, I find myself amazed almost every day by the rapidly increasing capabilities of frontier AI models. When I talk with other professionals in the field, I hear similar sentiments. If anything,&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;the rate of AI advancement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves many experts feeling overwhelmed and frankly somewhat scared.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The dangers of AI denial&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is the public buying into the narrative that AI is faltering, that the output is “slop,” and that the AI boom lacks authentic use cases? Personally, I believe it’s because we’ve fallen into a collective state of &lt;i&gt;AI denial&lt;/i&gt;, latching onto the narratives we want to hear in the face of strong evidence to the contrary. Denial is the first stage of grief and thus a reasonable reaction to the very disturbing prospect that we humans may soon lose&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/like-it-or-not-ai-is-learning-how-to-influence-you"&gt; &lt;u&gt;cognitive supremacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here on planet earth. In other words, the overblown AI bubble narrative is a societal defense mechanism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I get it. I’ve been warning about the&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;destabilizing risks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-happens-the-day-after-superintelligence"&gt; &lt;u&gt;demoralizing impact of superintelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for well over a decade, and I too feel AI is getting too smart too fast. The fact is, we are rapidly headed towards a future where widely available AI systems will be able to outperform most humans in most cognitive tasks, solving problems faster, more accurately and yes, &lt;i&gt;more creatively&lt;/i&gt; than any individual can. I emphasize “creativity” because AI denialists often insist that certain human qualities (particularly creativity and emotional intelligence&lt;i&gt;) &lt;/i&gt;will always be out of reach of AI systems. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the creativity front, today’s AI models can generate content faster and with more variation than any individual human. Critics argue that true creativity requires inner motivation. I resonate with that argument but find it circular — we&amp;#x27;re defining creativity based on how we experience it rather than the quality, originality or usefulness of the output. Also, we just don’t know if AI systems will develop internal drives or a sense of agency. Either way, if AI can produce original work that rivals most human professionals,&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;the impact on creative jobs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will still be quite devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The AI manipulation problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our human edge around emotional intelligence is even more precarious. It’s likely that AI will soon be able to read our emotions faster and more accurately than any human,&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16075-2_39"&gt; &lt;u&gt;tracking subtle cues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in our micro-expressions, vocal patterns, posture, gaze and even breathing. And as we integrate AI assistants into our phones, glasses and other wearable devices, these systems will monitor our emotional reactions throughout our day,&lt;a href="https://www.iiis.org/CDs2023/CD2023Summer/papers/HA408FU.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;building predictive models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of our behaviors. Without strict regulation, which is increasingly unlikely, these predictive models could be used to target us with&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11748"&gt; &lt;u&gt;individually optimized influence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that maximizes persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is called the&lt;a href="https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/elgar-concise-encyclopedia-of-artificial-intelligence-and-the-law-9781035336890.html"&gt; &lt;u&gt;AI manipulation problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it suggests that emotional intelligence may not give humanity an advantage. In fact, it could be a significant weakness, fostering an&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;asymmetric dynamic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where AI systems can read us with&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9965661/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;superhuman accuracy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while we can’t read AI at all. When you talk with photorealistic AI agents (and&lt;a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/1223362"&gt; &lt;u&gt;you will&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) you’ll see a smiling façade designed to appear warm, empathic and trustworthy. It will look and feel human, but that’s just an illusion, and it could easily&lt;a href="https://openaccess.cms-conferences.org/publications/book/978-1-958651-75-9/article/978-1-958651-75-9_13"&gt; &lt;u&gt;sway your perspectives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After all, our emotional reactions to faces are&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008204002151"&gt; &lt;u&gt;visceral reflexes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shaped by millions of years of evolution on a planet where every interactive human face we encountered was actually human. Soon, that will no longer be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are rapidly heading toward a world where many of the faces we encounter will belong to AI agents&lt;a href="https://www.privacylost.org/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;hiding behind digital facades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, these “&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9965661/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;virtual spokespeople&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” could easily have appearances that are designed for each of us based on our prior reactions – whatever gets us to best let down our guard. And yet many insist that AI is just another tech cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is wishful thinking. The massive investment pouring into AI isn’t driven by hype — it’s driven by the expectation that AI will permeate every aspect of daily life, embodied as intelligent actors we engage throughout our day. These systems will&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/enter-the-whisperverse-how-ai-voice-agents-will-guide-us-through-our-days"&gt; &lt;u&gt;assist us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, teach us and&lt;a href="https://github.com/GenerativeAIandHCI/GenerativeAIandHCI.github.io/blob/main/papers/2023/Conversational%20AI%20and%20the%20Threat%20to%20Epistemic%20Agency%20-%20CHI%202023%20.pdf"&gt; &lt;u&gt;influence us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They will reshape our lives, and it will happen faster than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we are not witnessing an AI bubble filling with empty gas. We are watching a new planet form, a molten world rapidly taking shape, and it will solidify into&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Next_Reality/k3LdEAAAQBAJ"&gt; &lt;u&gt;a new AI-powered society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Denial will not stop this.

Aneesh Pappu is a PhD student and Knight-Hennessy scholar at Stanford University who focuses on agentic AI and technology policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fear that elections could be overwhelmed by AI-generated realistic fake media has gone mainstream—and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that’s only half the story. The deeper threat isn’t that AI can just imitate people—it’s that it can actively persuade people. And&amp;nbsp;new research published this week&amp;nbsp;shows just how powerful that persuasion can be. AI chatbots can shift voters’ views by a substantial margin, far more than traditional political advertising tends to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, we will see the rise of AI that can personalize arguments, test what works, and quietly reshape political views at scale.

 &lt;p&gt;One day this fall, I watched an electronic sign outside the Broadway-Lafayette subway station in Manhattan switch seamlessly between an ad for makeup and one promoting the website&amp;nbsp;Pickyourbaby.com, which promises a way for potential parents to use genetic tests to influence their baby’s traits, including eye color, hair color, and IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inside the station, every surface was wrapped with more of its ads—babies on turnstiles, on staircases, on banners overhead. “Think about it. Makeup and then genetic optimization,” exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day after the campaign launched, Sadeghi and I had briefly sparred online. He’d been on X showing off a phone app where parents can click through traits like eye color and hair color. I snapped back that all this sounded a lot like Uber Eats—another crappy, frictionless future invented by entrepreneurs, but this time you’d click for a baby.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That night, I agreed to meet Sadeghi in the station under a banner that read, “IQ is 50% genetic.”&amp;nbsp;Read on to see how Antonio's conversation with Sadeghi went.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review’s weekly biotech newsletter.

That shift—from imitation to active persuasion—should worry us deeply.&amp;nbsp;Read the full story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ads that sell the sizzle of genetic trait discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Antonio Regalado, senior editor for biomedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One day this fall, I watched an electronic sign outside the Broadway-Lafayette subway station in Manhattan switch seamlessly between an ad for makeup and one promoting the website&amp;nbsp;Pickyourbaby.com, which promises a way for potential parents to use genetic tests to influence their baby’s traits, including eye color, hair color, and IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inside the station, every surface was wrapped with more of its ads—babies on turnstiles, on staircases, on banners overhead. “Think about it. Makeup and then genetic optimization,” exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day after the campaign launched, Sadeghi and I had briefly sparred online. He’d been on X showing off a phone app where parents can click through traits like eye color and hair color. I snapped back that all this sounded a lot like Uber Eats—another crappy, frictionless future invented by entrepreneurs, but this time you’d click for a baby.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That night, I agreed to meet Sadeghi in the station under a banner that read, “IQ is 50% genetic.”&amp;nbsp;Read on to see how Antonio's conversation with Sadeghi went.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review’s weekly biotech newsletter.

            &lt;p&gt;Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact, MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and “speak objects into existence,” creating things like furniture in as little as five minutes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the speech-to-reality system, a robotic arm mounted on a table is able&amp;nbsp;to receive spoken input from a human, such as “I want a simple stool,” and then construct the objects out of modular components. To date, the researchers have used the system to create stools, shelves, chairs, a small table, and even decorative items such as a dog statue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re connecting natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and robotic assembly,” says Alexander Htet Kyaw, an MIT graduate student and Morningside Academy for Design (MAD) fellow. “These are rapidly advancing areas of research that haven’t been brought together before in a way that you can actually make physical objects just from a simple speech prompt.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The idea started when Kyaw — a graduate student in the departments of Architecture and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — took Professor Neil Gershenfeld’s course, “How to Make Almost Anything.” In that class, he built the&amp;nbsp;speech-to-reality system. He continued working on the project at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), directed by Gershenfeld, collaborating with graduate students Se Hwan Jeon of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Miana Smith of CBA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speech-to-reality system begins with speech recognition that processes the user’s request using a&amp;nbsp;large language model, followed by 3D generative AI that creates a digital mesh representation of the object, and a voxelization algorithm that breaks down the 3D mesh into assembly components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, geometric processing modifies the AI-generated assembly to account for fabrication and physical constraints associated with the real world, such as the number of components, overhangs, and connectivity of the geometry. This is followed by creation of a feasible assembly sequence and automated path planning&amp;nbsp;for the robotic arm to assemble physical objects from user prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging natural language, the system makes design and manufacturing more accessible to people without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming.&amp;nbsp;And, unlike&amp;nbsp;3D printing, which can take hours or days, this system builds within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project is an interface between humans, AI, and robots to co-create the world around us,” Kyaw says.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine a scenario where you&amp;nbsp;say ‘I want a chair,’&amp;nbsp;and within five minutes a physical chair materializes in front of you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has immediate plans to improve the weight-bearing capability of the furniture by changing the means of connecting the cubes from magnets to more robust connections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also developed pipelines for converting voxel structures into feasible assembly sequences for small, distributed mobile robots, which could help translate this work to structures at any size scale,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;purpose of using modular components is to eliminate the waste that goes into making physical objects by disassembling and then reassembling them into something different, for instance turning a sofa into a bed when you no longer need the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Kyaw also has experience&amp;nbsp;using gesture recognition and augmented reality to interact with robots in the fabrication process, he is currently working on incorporating both speech and gestural control into the speech-to-reality system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaning into his memories of&amp;nbsp;the replicator in the “Star Trek” franchise and the robots in the&amp;nbsp;animated film “Big Hero 6,” Kyaw explains his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to increase access for people to make physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” he says. “I’m working toward a future where the very essence of matter is truly in your control.

After a period of eager experimentation, organizations are now confronting a more complex reality: While investment in AI has never been higher, the path from pilot to production remains elusive. Three-quarters of enterprises remain stuck in experimentation mode, despite mounting pressure to convert early tests into operational gains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1128742" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Concentrix-social-card-v2.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Most organizations can suffer from what we like to call PTSD, or process technology skills and data challenges,” says Shirley Hung, partner at Everest Group. “They have rigid, fragmented workflows that don't adapt well to change, technology systems that don't speak to each other, talent that is really immersed in low-value tasks rather than creating high impact.

Rather than positioning AI as a standalone tool or a “virtual worker,” this approach reframes AI as a system-level capability that augments human judgment, accelerates execution, and reimagines work from end to end. That shift requires organizations to map the value they want to create; design workflows that blend human oversight with AI-driven automation; and build the data, governance, and security foundations that make these systems trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

The result is a new blueprint for AI maturity grounded in reengineering how modern enterprises operate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"Optimization is really about doing existing things better, but reimagination is about discovering entirely new things that are worth doing," says Hung.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the webcast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webcast is produced in partnership with Concentrix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

After a period of eager experimentation, organizations are now confronting a more complex reality: While investment in AI has never been higher, the path from pilot to production remains elusive. Three-quarters of enterprises remain stuck in experimentation mode, despite mounting pressure to convert early tests into operational gains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1128742" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Concentrix-social-card-v2.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Most organizations can suffer from what we like to call PTSD, or process technology skills and data challenges,” says Shirley Hung, partner at Everest Group. “They have rigid, fragmented workflows that don't adapt well to change, technology systems that don't speak to each other, talent that is really immersed in low-value tasks rather than creating high impact.

Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company plans to add new partnerships in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook’s “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI’s ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune, which also filed suit this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times’ suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit — filed even as several publishers, including The Times, negotiate deals with AI firms — is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers’ Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times’s copyrighted works.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times also claims Perplexity’s search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media, and now AI,” Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity’s head of communications, told TechCrunch. “Fortunately it’s never worked, or we’d all be talking about this by telegraph.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(Publishers have, at times, won or shaped major legal battles over new technologies, resulting in settlements, licensing regimes, and court precedents.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit comes just over a year after The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Times is also suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet’s articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has shot its own accusations at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times’ lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multi-year deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated with comment from Perplexity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2150495091.jpg?resize=1200,825" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The New York Times filed suit Friday against AI search startup Perplexity for copyright infringement, its second lawsuit against an AI company.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times’ lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multi-year deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Customers might not be ready.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS announced made dozens of announcements from new AI agents and updated large language models, to products with LLM and agent-building capabilities. AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager? &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to enterprise market share for actual AI models. AWS does have the advantage of having everything in house, including infrastructure and its own AI training chips.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naveen Chhabra, a principal analyst at Forrester, told TechCrunch over email that while AWS announced a lot of cool new technology, it doesn’t change the fact that many enterprises aren’t ready to adopt AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AWS AI announcements show that AWS is thinking ahead and maybe far too ahead,” Chhabra wrote. “Most enterprises are still piloting AI projects and are rarely at the levels of maturity AWS expects them to be to take advantage of the offerings that come out of these announcements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A widely cited MIT study from August found that 95% of enterprises aren’t seeing a return on investment from AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ethan Feller, an equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told TechCrunch in a phone interview that the new Nova AI models, agents, and model-building capabilities weren’t what stood out to him as interesting from this week — despite these being the products AWS hyped the most. Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run AWS AI in their own data centers. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite all of this, AWS is still well positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded $11.4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
