(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/huawei-nvidia-cann-cuda-open-source-challenge/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A week after Huawei announced its decision to open-source the CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) software toolkit, the tech industry is still processing what this move means for the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By making its Huawei CANN open source alternative to CUDA freely available to developers worldwide, the Chinese tech giant has fired what many consider a significant shot in the battle against NVIDIA’s two-decade and continuing dominance over AI computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s a notable challenge to the status quo, the real question is whether Huawei can overcome the substantial technical and systemic barriers that have kept CUDA virtually unchallenged for nearly twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is CANN and why does it matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANN is Huawei’s heterogeneous computing architecture that offers multi-level programming interfaces to help developers build AI applications optimised for Huawei’s Ascend AI GPUs. First introduced in 2018 as part of Huawei’s AI strategy, CANN serves as the company’s equivalent to NVIDIA’s CUDA platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANN provides APIs for AI applications on Ascend, giving developers several options for building high-level and performance-intensive applications. The architecture represents years of development aimed at creating a comprehensive software ecosystem around Huawei’s AI hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The strategic timing behind the open-source decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s decision to make CANN open-source comes at a particularly tense moment in US-China technology relations. Huawei’s rotating chairman Eric Xu Zhijun said the move would help “speed up innovation from developers” and “make Ascend easier to use” during the company’s developer conference in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement follows closely after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) launched an inquiry into NVIDIA, based on what it called “serious security issues” involving Nvidia’s processors and demands from US lawmakers to add tracking features to chips’ hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulatory scrutiny adds another layer of complexity to an already strained relationship between the two superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CUDA’s monopolistic grip on AI development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of Huawei’s move, it’s important to examine NVIDIA’s CUDA dominance. CUDA, often described as a closed-off “moat” or, on occasion, “swamp,” has been viewed by some as a barrier for developers seeking cross-platform compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its tight integration with Nvidia hardware has locked developers into a single vendor ecosystem for the last two decades, with all efforts to bring CUDA to other GPU architectures through translation layers being blocked by the company. It’s added provisions to its CUDA licence agreement that prevent developers from running CUDA on third-party GPUs via translation layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese AI developers use Nvidia’s GPUs partly because of the CUDA platform, which has been the default development platform for years. This situation highlights the challenge Huawei faces in convincing developers to migrate to its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry analysis and market implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology analysts have offered mixed assessments of Huawei’s open-source strategy. While open-sourcing CANN could help Huawei accelerate adoption of its in-house software toolkit and thereby its hardware, it will likely take years for CANN to match the ecosystem support of CUDA, which has been maintained continuously and refined over nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitive landscape reveals the magnitude of Huawei’s challenge. Even with open-source status, adoption may depend on how well CANN supports existing AI frameworks, particularly for emerging workloads in large language models and AI writer tools. The software ecosystem around CUDA includes thousands of optimised libraries and extensive documentation that took years to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are signs of progress in Huawei’s hardware, with several claims that certain Ascend chips can outperform Nvidia processors under specific conditions. Reports suggest that CloudMatrix 384’s benchmark results against Nvidia running DeepSeek R1 suggest that Huawei’s performance trajectory is closing the performance gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building an alternative ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei has, according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;, begun discussions with major Chinese AI users, universities, research institutions, and business partners about contributing to an open-sourced Ascend development community. The collaborative approach mirrors successful open-source initiatives in other technology sectors, where community contributions accelerate development and adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Global chip war context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open-source CANN initiative fits into China’s technology independence. The country’s open-source drive is gaining momentum, with more domestic tech companies working to make their proprietary technologies publicly accessible. Recent examples include Xiaomi’s open-sourcing of its MiDashengLM-7B audio large language model and Alibaba’s release of the Qwen3-Coder AI coding model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all happening against the backdrop of ongoing US export restrictions targeting Chinese technology companies. In the current environment, where US restrictions affect Huawei’s hardware exports, building a robust domestic software stack for AI tools becomes as important as improving chip performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expert scepticism and challenges ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw performance alone will not guarantee developer migration without equivalent software stability and support. The challenge extends beyond technical capabilities to include documentation quality, community activity, and integration into development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The road ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications for the global semiconductor industry remain significant. As the US-China technology competition intensifies, Huawei’s open-source strategy represents a shift from competing on proprietary platforms to building collaborative ecosystems that could reshape how AI software development evolves globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this initiative will successfully challenge NVIDIA’s dominance remains to be seen, but it certainly marks a new chapter in the ongoing battle for control over the AI computing infrastructure that powers the next generation of technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Turing Institute: Humanities are key to the future of AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It all starts with creating the right rules and ends with hunting down new threats in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up is the Usage Policy, which is basically the rulebook for how Claude should and shouldn’t be used. It gives clear guidance on big issues like election integrity and child safety, and also on using Claude responsibly in sensitive fields like finance or healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shape these rules, the team uses a Unified Harm Framework. This helps them think through any potential negative impacts, from physical and psychological to economic and societal harm. It’s less of a formal grading system and more of a structured way to weigh the risks when making decisions. They also bring in outside experts for Policy Vulnerability Tests. These specialists in areas like terrorism and child safety try to “break” Claude with tough questions to see where the weaknesses are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw this in action during the 2024 US elections. After working with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, Anthropic realised Claude might give out old voting information. So, they added a banner that pointed users to TurboVote, a reliable source for up-to-date, non-partisan election info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-claude-right-from-wrong"&gt;Teaching Claude right from wrong&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anthropic Safeguards team works closely with the developers who train Claude to build safety from the start. This means deciding what kinds of things Claude should and shouldn’t do, and embedding those values into the model itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also team up with specialists to get this right. For example, by partnering with ThroughLine, a crisis support leader, they’ve taught Claude how to handle sensitive conversations about mental health and self-harm with care, rather than just refusing to talk. This careful training is why Claude will turn down requests to help with illegal activities, write malicious code, or create scams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before any new version of Claude goes live, it’s put through its paces with three key types of evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety evaluations:&lt;/strong&gt; These tests check if Claude sticks to the rules, even in tricky, long conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk assessments:&lt;/strong&gt; For really high-stakes areas like cyber threats or biological risks, the team does specialised testing, often with help from government and industry partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bias evaluations:&lt;/strong&gt; This is all about fairness. They check if Claude gives reliable and accurate answers for everyone, testing for political bias or skewed responses based on things like gender or race.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intense testing helps the team see if the training has stuck and tells them if they need to build extra protections before launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cycle of how the Anthropic Safeguards team approaches building effective AI safety protections throughout the lifecycle of its Claude models." class="wp-image-107345" height="674" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/anthropic-claude-safety-ai-strategy-cycle-artificial-intelligence-1024x674.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Credit: Anthropic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-never-sleeping-ai-safety-strategy"&gt;Anthropic’s never-sleeping AI safety strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Claude is out in the world, a mix of automated systems and human reviewers keep an eye out for trouble.

A mock newspaper in the movie hails it as the “greatest peace argument ever invented.” The experimental weapon is “the exclusive property of Uncle Sam,” Reagan’s character declares.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than 40 years later, this cinematic vision—an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace—became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan’s presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it’s now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, “Star Wars.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. It didn’t work in the 1980s, Trump said, because the technology wasn’t there. But times have changed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump’s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen so many things.

He acted out a scene of missile defense experts triangulating the path of an incoming weapon. “Ding, ding, ding, ding,” he said, as he mimed typing on a keyboard. “Missile launch? &lt;em&gt;Psshing!!&lt;/em&gt;” He raised his hand to indicate the rising missile, then let it fall to signal the successful interception: “Boom.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel’s Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. At the rally, he pledged to “build an Iron Dome over our country, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield made in the USA … a lot of it right here in New Hampshire, actually.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within a week of his inauguration, President Trump began working toward this promise by issuing an executive order to develop “The Iron Dome for America,” which was rebranded the “Golden Dome” a month later. The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June—including Trump’s decision to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities—has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;

Both efforts demonstrate the performative power of spectacle in defense policy, especially when wielded by deft showmen like Reagan and Trump. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump’s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure, often rendered in deceptively simple concept art depicting a society made immune to catastrophic strikes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in the complicated security landscape confronting the world today, is spectacle the same as safety?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Missile defense is an area where facts and fiction blend,” says Anette Stimmer, a lecturer in international relations at the University of St Andrews who has researched SDI. “A lot is up to interpretation by all the actors involved.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump’s view is simple: Space is as much a warfighting domain as land, air, and ocean, and therefore the US must assert its dominance there with advanced technologies.

We owe it to our children and our children’s children to protect them and afford them a quality of life that we have all grown up enjoying.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With that vision in mind, Trump’s executive order outlines a host of goals for missile defense, some of which support bipartisan priorities like protecting supply chains and upgrading sensor arrays. The specific architecture of the Golden Dome is still being hammered out, but the initial executive order envisions a multi-tiered system of new sensors and interceptors—on the ground, in the air, and in space—that would work together to counter the threat of attacks from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The system would be coordinated in part by artificial-intelligence models trained for real-time threat detection and response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology that links the Golden Dome directly to SDI hinges on one key bullet point in the order that demands the “development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept.” This language revives Reagan’s dream of deploying hundreds of missile interceptors in orbit to target missiles in the boost phase right after liftoff, a window of just a few minutes when the projectiles are slower and still near the attacker’s territory.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Space weapons are an attractive option for targeting the boost phase because interceptors need to be close enough to the launching missile to hit it. If a nation fired off long-range missiles from deep in its territory, the nearest ground- or air-based interceptors could be thousands of miles from the launch site. Space interceptors, in contrast, would be just a few hundred miles overhead of the ascending missiles, allowing for a much faster reaction time. But though the dream of boost-phase interception dates back decades, these maneuvers have never been operationally demonstrated from ground, air, or space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a really hard problem that hasn’t been solved,” says Laura Grego, senior scientist and research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists’ global security program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US is currently protected by the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which consists of 44 interceptor missiles split between bases in Alaska and California, along with a network of early-­warning sensors on the ground, at sea, and in orbit. Tests suggest that the GMD would have about a 50% success rate at intercepting missiles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Initiated by President Bill Clinton in the late ’90s and accelerated by President George W. Bush in the 2000s, the GMD is intended mainly to defend against rogue states like North Korea, which has nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US. A secondary focus is Iran, which does not currently have a nuclear weapon or ICBMs. Still, the GMD is built to anticipate a possible future where it develops those capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The GMD is not designed to protect the US from the sort of large-scale and coordinated missile attacks that Russia and China could lob across the world. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. All these networks are designed to intercept missiles during their midcourse cruise phase, as they hurtle through the sky or space, or during their terminal or reentry phase, as they approach their targets. The GMD has cost upward of $63 billion since it was initiated, and the US spends about an additional $20 billion to $30 billion annually on its array of other missile defense systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, projected that the cost of the space-based interceptors could total from $161 billion to $542 billion over the course of 20 years. The wide range can be explained by the current lack of specifics on those orbital interceptors’ design and number.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is “probably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,” says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,” she continues. “There’s a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. It’s got very significant policy implications, strategic stability implications, in addition to cost implications and technology feasibility challenges.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed. Regardless of whether the Golden Dome materializes, the program is already raising geopolitical anxieties reminiscent of the Cold War era. Back then, the US had one main adversary: the Soviet Union. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Here we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this—that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,” Grego says. “Overnight, we’re like, ‘No, actually, we’re doing it.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact that we “blew up that logic” will “have a big impact on whether or not the program actually succeeds in creating the vision that it lays out,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Russian and Chinese officials called the Golden Dome “deeply destabilizing in nature” in a joint statement in May, and North Korea’s foreign ministry warned it could “turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reagan, by all accounts, believed that SDI would be the ultimate tool of peace for all nations, and he even offered to share the technology with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his “America First” brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. The Golden Dome is both an expression of Trump’s belief that the world is leeching off America and a bargaining chip in negotiations toward a new power balance; Canada could be covered by the shield for free, he has said—in exchange for becoming the 51st state.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations—undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term’s marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. That administration did build more physical barriers along the border (though US taxpayers, not Mexico, footed the bill). But just as important, the wall emerged as a symbolic shorthand for tougher immigration control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Golden Dome is the second-term amplification of that promise, a wall that expands the concept of the “border” to the entire American airspace. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Golden Dome’s orbital interceptors are supposedly there to target the early boost phase of missiles on or near the launch site, not over the United States. But the image of a besieged America, repelling enemy fire from the heavens, provides the visual and cinematic idea of both threat and security that Trump hopes to impress on the public.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“This administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,” says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book &lt;em&gt;Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America’s missile defense systems. No long-range missile has ever struck US soil, but an attack would be disastrous for the nation and the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve come a long way in terms of missile defense,” says Tomero. “There has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="outline of the United States inside a corked glass bottle with scorpions" class="wp-image-1121492" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skorpio.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI—and that tarnished it with the derisive name “Star Wars”—stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn’t want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? It is a universal dream,” says Stimmer. “It requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete,” ushering in “world peace,” as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction could be replaced by mutually assured survival, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Now there are many more scorpions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gorbachev saw the space-based shield as an offensive weapon, since it would give the US a first-strike advantage. The imbalance, he warned, could spark a weapons race in space, a domain that had been spared from overt military conflicts. As a result, the initiative would only destabilize the world order and interrupt the progress of arms control and nuclear de-proliferation efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan’s insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan’s refusal to give up SDI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not the Strategic Defense Initiative; it’s a strategic defense ideology,” says Linenthal. He mentions the famous metaphor used by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a central figure of the Manhattan Project, who compared the United States and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Either scorpion could kill the other, but only at the probable cost of its own life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan felt a “tremendously powerful impetus” to escape Oppenheimer’s metaphor, Linenthal noted: “It was a new kind of deliverance that would resolve it all. Of course, now there are many more scorpions, so it has to be a bigger bottle.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A true believer, Reagan never abandoned SDI in spite of cost overruns and public backlash. President Bill Clinton redirected the program in 1993 by shifting gears from global to regional missile defense, a focus that remained fairly consistent for decades—until Trump took center stage. Now, the Golden Dome has flipped that logic on its head, risking a possible escalation of military tensions in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tomero describes a “nightmare scenario” in which adversaries attack the Golden Dome’s space infrastructure, leaving the orbital environment filled with debris that renders the defense system, among countless other space assets, inoperable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a one-sided capability that is very threatening to our adversaries is obviously going to create very dangerous stability issues,” she says. It could “lead to inadvertent escalation and miscalculation and, I think, lower the threshold to conflict and nuclear war.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As president, Trump has channeled the boardroom antics that once resuscitated his celebrity status on &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;. But armed adversaries, long wary of America’s position on missile defense, don’t have the luxury of wondering whether it’s all real or just more stagecraft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What makes Trump so difficult to read for others is his unpredictability,” Stimmer says. “This, just by itself, destabilizes things, because no one knows what he’ll actually do.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump has described the Golden Dome as nearly impenetrable by missile attacks, evoking a clear symbolic return to an American golden age where we can all feel safe again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“All of them will be knocked out of the air,” as “the success rate is very close to 100%,” he said at the project’s official launch in May. “We will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of &lt;/em&gt;First Contact&lt;em&gt;, a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1940, a fresh-faced Ronald Reagan starred as US Secret Service agent Brass Bancroft in&lt;em&gt; Murder in the Air,&lt;/em&gt; an action film centered on a fictional “superweapon” that could stop enemy aircraft midflight. A mock newspaper in the movie hails it as the “greatest peace argument ever invented.” The experimental weapon is “the exclusive property of Uncle Sam,” Reagan’s character declares.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than 40 years later, this cinematic vision—an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace—became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan’s presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it’s now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, “Star Wars.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. It didn’t work in the 1980s, Trump said, because the technology wasn’t there. But times have changed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump’s impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen so many things. I’ve seen shots that you wouldn’t even believe,” Trump said. He acted out a scene of missile defense experts triangulating the path of an incoming weapon. “Ding, ding, ding, ding,” he said, as he mimed typing on a keyboard. “Missile launch? &lt;em&gt;Psshing!!&lt;/em&gt;” He raised his hand to indicate the rising missile, then let it fall to signal the successful interception: “Boom.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Bush in the 2000s, the GMD is intended mainly to defend against rogue states like North Korea, which has nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the US. A secondary focus is Iran, which does not currently have a nuclear weapon or ICBMs. Still, the GMD is built to anticipate a possible future where it develops those capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The GMD is not designed to protect the US from the sort of large-scale and coordinated missile attacks that Russia and China could lob across the world. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. All these networks are designed to intercept missiles during their midcourse cruise phase, as they hurtle through the sky or space, or during their terminal or reentry phase, as they approach their targets. The GMD has cost upward of $63 billion since it was initiated, and the US spends about an additional $20 billion to $30 billion annually on its array of other missile defense systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, projected that the cost of the space-based interceptors could total from $161 billion to $542 billion over the course of 20 years. The wide range can be explained by the current lack of specifics on those orbital interceptors’ design and number.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is “probably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,” says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,” she continues. “There’s a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. It’s got very significant policy implications, strategic stability implications, in addition to cost implications and technology feasibility challenges.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed. Regardless of whether the Golden Dome materializes, the program is already raising geopolitical anxieties reminiscent of the Cold War era. Back then, the US had one main adversary: the Soviet Union. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Here we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this—that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,” Grego says. “Overnight, we’re like, ‘No, actually, we’re doing it.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact that we “blew up that logic” will “have a big impact on whether or not the program actually succeeds in creating the vision that it lays out,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Russian and Chinese officials called the Golden Dome “deeply destabilizing in nature” in a joint statement in May, and North Korea’s foreign ministry warned it could “turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reagan, by all accounts, believed that SDI would be the ultimate tool of peace for all nations, and he even offered to share the technology with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his “America First” brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. The Golden Dome is both an expression of Trump’s belief that the world is leeching off America and a bargaining chip in negotiations toward a new power balance; Canada could be covered by the shield for free, he has said—in exchange for becoming the 51st state.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations—undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term’s marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. That administration did build more physical barriers along the border (though US taxpayers, not Mexico, footed the bill). But just as important, the wall emerged as a symbolic shorthand for tougher immigration control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Golden Dome is the second-term amplification of that promise, a wall that expands the concept of the “border” to the entire American airspace. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Golden Dome’s orbital interceptors are supposedly there to target the early boost phase of missiles on or near the launch site, not over the United States. But the image of a besieged America, repelling enemy fire from the heavens, provides the visual and cinematic idea of both threat and security that Trump hopes to impress on the public.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“This administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,” says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book &lt;em&gt;Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America’s missile defense systems. No long-range missile has ever struck US soil, but an attack would be disastrous for the nation and the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’ve come a long way in terms of missile defense,” says Tomero. “There has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="outline of the United States inside a corked glass bottle with scorpions" class="wp-image-1121492" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skorpio.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI—and that tarnished it with the derisive name “Star Wars”—stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn’t want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? It is a universal dream,” says Stimmer. “It requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete,” ushering in “world peace,” as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction could be replaced by mutually assured survival, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Now there are many more scorpions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gorbachev saw the space-based shield as an offensive weapon, since it would give the US a first-strike advantage. The imbalance, he warned, could spark a weapons race in space, a domain that had been spared from overt military conflicts. As a result, the initiative would only destabilize the world order and interrupt the progress of arms control and nuclear de-proliferation efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan’s insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan’s refusal to give up SDI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not the Strategic Defense Initiative; it’s a strategic defense ideology,” says Linenthal. He mentions the famous metaphor used by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a central figure of the Manhattan Project, who compared the United States and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Either scorpion could kill the other, but only at the probable cost of its own life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reagan felt a “tremendously powerful impetus” to escape Oppenheimer’s metaphor, Linenthal noted: “It was a new kind of deliverance that would resolve it all. Of course, now there are many more scorpions, so it has to be a bigger bottle.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A true believer, Reagan never abandoned SDI in spite of cost overruns and public backlash. President Bill Clinton redirected the program in 1993 by shifting gears from global to regional missile defense, a focus that remained fairly consistent for decades—until Trump took center stage. Now, the Golden Dome has flipped that logic on its head, risking a possible escalation of military tensions in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tomero describes a “nightmare scenario” in which adversaries attack the Golden Dome’s space infrastructure, leaving the orbital environment filled with debris that renders the defense system, among countless other space assets, inoperable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a one-sided capability that is very threatening to our adversaries is obviously going to create very dangerous stability issues,” she says. It could “lead to inadvertent escalation and miscalculation and, I think, lower the threshold to conflict and nuclear war.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As president, Trump has channeled the boardroom antics that once resuscitated his celebrity status on &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;. But armed adversaries, long wary of America’s position on missile defense, don’t have the luxury of wondering whether it’s all real or just more stagecraft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What makes Trump so difficult to read for others is his unpredictability,” Stimmer says. “This, just by itself, destabilizes things, because no one knows what he’ll actually do.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump has described the Golden Dome as nearly impenetrable by missile attacks, evoking a clear symbolic return to an American golden age where we can all feel safe again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“All of them will be knocked out of the air,” as “the success rate is very close to 100%,” he said at the project’s official launch in May. “We will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Ferreira is a science reporter based in upstate New York, and author of &lt;/em&gt;First Contact&lt;em&gt;, a book about the search for alien life, which will be published in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/13/1121332/trump-golden-dome-missile-defense-national-security/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] NeoLogic wants to build more energy-efficient CPUs for AI data centers (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/neologic-wants-to-build-more-energy-efficient-cpus-for-ai-data-centers/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NeoLogic-founders-from-left-to-right-Avi-Messica-Ziv-Leshem.-Credit-Aviv-Kurt.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When NeoLogic started building its more energy-efficient CPUs for AI servers, folks in the industry told its founders Avi Messica and Ziv Leshem that their idea wasn’t viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Most of the people that we have met say it’s impossible,” Messica told TechCrunch. “Some of them told us, at the time, that the innovation is impossible because you cannot innovate in logic synthesis. You can’t innovate in circuit design. It’s too mature.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Israel-based NeoLogic nevertheless set out to prove them wrong, and the fabless semiconductor startup has been building a server CPU that uses more simplified logic — how a chip processes information — with fewer transistors and logic gates to run faster while requiring less power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;NeoLogic was founded in 2021 by Messica, CEO, and Leshem, CTO, who together have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Leshem spent decades working on chip design at companies like Intel and Synopsis, while Messica focused on circuit design and the manufacturing side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We co-founded this company more than four years ago because Moore’s law was dead,” Messica said, referring to the 1960s observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Around a decade ago, Messica said, companies stopped trying to scale transistors down in size, because transistors had gotten so small, there wasn’t much more progress to be made there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, he says, NeoLogic wasn’t convinced. The startup is working with two hyperscaler partners on the design of the server CPUs, but Messica would not disclose their names. The company plans to have a single-core test chip by the end of the year and hopes to get its server CPUs into data centers by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;NeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility, and lool Ventures. The company will use the funds to expand its engineering team and continue developing its CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding round comes as data centers are straining existing energy resources with no relief in sight. The ongoing AI boom has data center power usage expected to double in just the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Messica hopes that NeoLogic’s energy-saving potential will help make its server CPUs too attractive for the market to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It affects everything,” Messica said of the potential energy savings. “If you talk about next-generation data centers, it affects the construction costs; it affects the amount of capital that you’ll invest because you can shave off roughly 30% of the cost. And it affects the water usage. It has an impact on society, and basically that was our vision roughly five years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NeoLogic-founders-from-left-to-right-Avi-Messica-Ziv-Leshem.-Credit-Aviv-Kurt.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When NeoLogic started building its more energy-efficient CPUs for AI servers, folks in the industry told its founders Avi Messica and Ziv Leshem that their idea wasn’t viable.&lt;/p&gt;

The eruption of a revived conflict between Israel and Iran in June has only strengthened the case for an American version of the Iron Dome in the eyes of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel’s Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLUX.1 models allow users to edit existing images with simple language, without the need for fine-tuning or complex workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying powerful AI requires curation of model variants, adaptation to manage all input and output data, and quantization to reduce VRAM requirements. Models must be converted to work with optimized inference backend software and connected to new AI application programming interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] NIM microservice simplifies this process, unlocking faster generative AI workflows, and is optimized for RTX AI PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generative AI in Kontext&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is an open-weight generative model built for image editing. It features a guided, step-by-step generation process that makes it easier to control how an image evolves, whether refining small details or transforming an entire scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83711"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-83711" height="934" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flux-bird-1680x934.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83711"&gt;Image generated by FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] with a simple text prompt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Because the model accepts both text and image inputs, users can easily reference a visual concept and guide how it evolves in a natural and intuitive way. This enables coherent, high-quality image edits that stay true to the original concept.
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83714"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83714" height="681" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flux-example.png" width="1205" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83714"&gt;Guide edits with simple language, without the need for fine-tuning or complex workflows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] NIM microservice provides prepackaged, optimized files that are ready for one-click download through ComfyUI NIM nodes — making them easily accessible to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83717"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83717" height="716" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flux-birds.png" width="1301" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83717"&gt;The original image is revised with six prompts to reach the desired result.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA and Black Forest Labs worked together to quantize FLUX.1 Kontext [dev], reducing the model size from 24GB to 12GB for FP8 (NVIDIA Ada Generation GPUs) and 7GB for FP4 (NVIDIA Blackwell architecture). The FP8 checkpoint is optimized for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which have FP8 accelerators in their Tensor Cores. The FP4 checkpoint is optimized for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs and uses a new method called SVDQuant, which preserves image quality while reducing model size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83720"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83720" height="424" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/flux-chart.png" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83720"&gt;Speedup compared with BF16 GPU (left, higher is better), and memory usage required to run FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] in different precisions (right, lower is better).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;In addition, NVIDIA TensorRT — a framework to access the Tensor Cores in NVIDIA RTX GPUs for maximum performance — provides over 2x acceleration compared with running the original BF16 model with PyTorch.
&lt;p&gt;These dramatic performance gains were previously limited to AI specialists and developers with advanced AI infrastructure knowledge. With the FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] NIM microservice, even enthusiasts can achieve these time savings with greater performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get NIMble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is available on Hugging Face with TensorRT optimizations and ComfyUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, follow the directions on ComfyUI’s NIM nodes GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NVIDIA AI Workbench.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ComfyUI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NIM nodes through the ComfyUI Manager within the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the model licenses on Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 Kontext’s [dev] Hugging Face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node will prepare the desired workflow and help with downloading all necessary models after clicking “Run.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIM microservices are optimized for performance on NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs and include popular models from the AI community. Explore NIM microservices on GitHub and build.nvidia.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get NIMble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is available on Hugging Face with TensorRT optimizations and ComfyUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, follow the directions on ComfyUI’s NIM nodes GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NVIDIA AI Workbench.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ComfyUI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install NIM nodes through the ComfyUI Manager within the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the model licenses on Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 Kontext’s [dev] Hugging Face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The node will prepare the desired workflow and help with downloading all necessary models after clicking “Run.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIM microservices are optimized for performance on NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs and include popular models from the AI community. Explore NIM microservices on GitHub and build.nvidia.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each week, the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;RTX AI Garage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;blog series features community-driven AI innovations and content for those looking to learn more about NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, as well as building &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;AI agents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, creative workflows, productivity apps and more on AI PCs and workstations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plug in to NVIDIA AI PC on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;TikTok&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; — and stay informed by subscribing to the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;RTX AI PC newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Join NVIDIA’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discord server&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; to connect with community developers and AI enthusiasts for discussions on what’s possible with RTX AI.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI and its cofounder Sam Altman are preparing to back a company that will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink by connecting human brains with computers, heightening the rivalry between the two billionaire entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new venture, called Merge Labs, is raising new funds at an $850 million valuation, with much of the new capital expected to come from OpenAI’s ventures team, according to three people with direct knowledge of the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman has encouraged the investment and will help launch the project alongside Alex Blania, who runs World, an eyeball-scanning digital ID project also backed by the OpenAI chief, said two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman will cofound the company but not have a day-to-day role in the new project, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merge is one of a slate of young companies looking to take advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to build more useful brain-computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its name comes from what many in Silicon Valley describe as “the merge,” a moment when humans and machines come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman wrote a lengthy blog post on the topic in 2017, speculating that moment could come as soon as 2025. This year, he suggested in another blog post that we could soon have “high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces” as a result of recent technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company aims to raise $250 million from OpenAI and other investors, although the talks are at an early stage. Altman will not personally invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new venture would be in direct competition with Neuralink, founded by Musk in 2016, which seeks to wire brains directly to computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI, but Musk left the board in 2018 after clashing with Altman, and the two have since become fierce rivals in their pursuit of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk launched his own AI start-up, xAI, in 2023 and has been attempting to block OpenAI’s conversion from a nonprofit in the courts. Musk donated much of the initial capital to get OpenAI off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain implants are a decades-old technology, but recent leaps forward in AI and in the electronic components used to collect brain signals have offered the prospect that they can become more practically useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman has backed a number of other companies in markets adjacent to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is valued at $300 billion. In addition to cofounding World, he has also invested in the nuclear fission group Oklo and nuclear fusion project Helion.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that GPT-4o has returned to ChatGPT following intense user backlash over its removal during last week's GPT-5 launch. The AI model now appears in the model picker for all paid ChatGPT users by default (including ChatGPT Plus accounts), marking a swift reversal after thousands of users complained about losing access to their preferred models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of GPT-4o comes after what Altman described as OpenAI underestimating "how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them." In an attempt to simplify its offerings, OpenAI had initially removed all previous AI models from ChatGPT when GPT-5 launched on August 7, forcing users to adopt the new model without warning. The move sparked one of the most vocal user revolts in ChatGPT's history, with a Reddit thread titled "GPT-5 is horrible" gathering over 2,000 comments within days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with bringing back GPT-4o, OpenAI made several other changes to address user concerns. Rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking mode increased from 200 to 3,000 messages per week, with additional capacity available through "GPT-5 Thinking mini" after reaching that limit. The company also added new routing options—"Auto," "Fast," and "Thinking"—giving users more control over which GPT-5 variant handles their queries.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pro users who pay $200 a month for access, Altman confirmed that additional models, including o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini, will later become available through a "Show additional models" toggle in ChatGPT web settings. He noted that GPT-4.5 will remain exclusive to Pro subscribers due to high GPU costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Addressing “personality” concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond model availability, OpenAI acknowledged widespread complaints about GPT-5's output style. Users had described the new model as "abrupt and sharp" compared to GPT-4o's more conversational tone. Some users with emotional attachments to the older model expressed grief over losing what they considered their "only friend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are working on an update to GPT-5's personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o," Altman wrote in his announcement. He added that OpenAI recognizes the need for "more per-user customization of model personality" going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPT-5 launch had been plagued by multiple issues beyond model removal. An automatic routing system meant to select appropriate model variants malfunctioned on launch day, consistently defaulting to less capable versions. OpenAI also faced criticism for including misleading performance graphs in the launch presentation, which Altman later called a "mega chart screwup."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GPT-4o has returned for now, OpenAI continues to refine GPT-5. The company indicated that rate limits may need further adjustments "depending on usage" and that personality updates remain in development. For now, paid ChatGPT users can select their preferred model, offering a compromise between OpenAI's push toward newer AI models and user demands for choice.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that GPT-4o has returned to ChatGPT following intense user backlash over its removal during last week's GPT-5 launch. The AI model now appears in the model picker for all paid ChatGPT users by default (including ChatGPT Plus accounts), marking a swift reversal after thousands of users complained about losing access to their preferred models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of GPT-4o comes after what Altman described as OpenAI underestimating "how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them." In an attempt to simplify its offerings, OpenAI had initially removed all previous AI models from ChatGPT when GPT-5 launched on August 7, forcing users to adopt the new model without warning. The move sparked one of the most vocal user revolts in ChatGPT's history, with a Reddit thread titled "GPT-5 is horrible" gathering over 2,000 comments within days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with bringing back GPT-4o, OpenAI made several other changes to address user concerns. Rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking mode increased from 200 to 3,000 messages per week, with additional capacity available through "GPT-5 Thinking mini" after reaching that limit. The company also added new routing options—"Auto," "Fast," and "Thinking"—giving users more control over which GPT-5 variant handles their queries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pro users who pay $200 a month for access, Altman confirmed that additional models, including o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini, will later become available through a "Show additional models" toggle in ChatGPT web settings. He noted that GPT-4.5 will remain exclusive to Pro subscribers due to high GPU costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Addressing “personality” concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond model availability, OpenAI acknowledged widespread complaints about GPT-5's output style. Users had described the new model as "abrupt and sharp" compared to GPT-4o's more conversational tone. Some users with emotional attachments to the older model expressed grief over losing what they considered their "only friend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are working on an update to GPT-5's personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o," Altman wrote in his announcement. He added that OpenAI recognizes the need for "more per-user customization of model personality" going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPT-5 launch had been plagued by multiple issues beyond model removal. An automatic routing system meant to select appropriate model variants malfunctioned on launch day, consistently defaulting to less capable versions. OpenAI also faced criticism for including misleading performance graphs in the launch presentation, which Altman later called a "mega chart screwup."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GPT-4o has returned for now, OpenAI continues to refine GPT-5. The company indicated that rate limits may need further adjustments "depending on usage" and that personality updates remain in development. For now, paid ChatGPT users can select their preferred model, offering a compromise between OpenAI's push toward newer AI models and user demands for choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The terms of the deal were not shared, but it appears to follow the acqui-hire playbook we’re increasingly seeing in the tech industry amid the war for AI talent. Humanloop’s three co-founders — CEO Raza Habib, CTO Peter Hayes, and CPO Jordan Burgess — have all joined Anthropic, alongside around a dozen engineers and researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is growing fast in the enterprise space as it leads in agentic and coding capabilities. While an Anthropic spokesperson confirmed that the AI firm did not acquire Humanloop’s assets or its intellectual property, that’s a moot point in an industry where IP lives in the brain. And what Humanloop’s team is bringing to Anthropic is experience developing the tools that help enterprises run safe, reliable AI at scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or as Brad Abrams, API product lead at Anthropic, put it: “Their proven experience in AI tooling and evaluation will be invaluable as we continue to advance our work in AI safety and building&amp;nbsp;useful AI systems.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a market where model quality alone isn’t enough to stay competitive, bolstering its tooling ecosystem could position Anthropic to cement its lead over OpenAI and Google DeepMind in both performance and enterprise readiness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Humanloop was founded in 2020 as a University College London spinout. The startup then went on to participate in Y Combinator and the Fuse Incubator before raising $7.91 million in seed funding across two rounds led by YC and Index Ventures, per PitchBook. Humanloop gained a reputation for helping enterprise customers — including Duolingo, Gusto, and Vanta — develop, evaluate, and fine-tune robust AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, Humanloop told customers that it would be shutting down in preparation for an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The timing of this acqui-hire comes as Anthropic offers features like longer context windows to enterprise clients, improving what its models are capable of and where they can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, Anthropic reached a deal with the U.S. government’s central purchasing arm to sell its AI services to government agencies across executive, judiciary, and legislative branches for just $1 per agency for the first year — a clear move to undercut OpenAI’s similarly priced offering. Both government and enterprise buyers demand the type of evaluation, monitoring, and compliance features that Humanloop specialized in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The acquisition is also on brand for Anthropic as it bills itself as a “safety-first” AI company. Humanloop’s evaluation workflows align with that mission by providing constant performance measurement, safety guardrails, and bias mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“From our earliest days, we’ve been focused on creating tools that help developers build AI applications safely and effectively,” said Raza Habib, former CEO of Humanloop, in a statement. “Anthropic’s commitment to AI safety research and responsible AI development perfectly aligns with our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;

That is, the company intends to match its audio series with hundreds of episodes to its users’ tastes. For that to work, it needs to release content rapidly — something it’s now turning to AI to help with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lightspeed-backed startup is giving its writers an AI tool set that can do things like suggest better endings to an episode or make the narrative more engaging. The hope is that the tools will speed up the story-writing process.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pocket FM already uses some AI tools like ElevenLabs to generate voices for audio series. It also tested AI tools for writing and adaptation assistance internally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohan Nayak, Pocket FM’s founder, said it’s rolling out the AI tools to all writers, so it will take them less time to finish their episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036537" height="334" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-5.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pocket FM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The writing tool, dubbed CoPilot, can be used to help any writer create a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CoPilot can transform narrative-based writing into dialog-based writing for a specific segment. It can also do “beat analysis” to shape the writing in a way to makes it more engaging for an audio series of a particular genre. The tool additionally has basic chatbot-style writing features such as “shorten,” “expand,” and the ability to generate text via a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To build CoPilot, the company examined thousands of hours of data points to understand what makes users engage more with a particular storyline in a specific genre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based on that, it added writing suggestion features designed to increase conflict between characters and recommend endings for an episode to make it more exciting. AI can also suggest tags for background effects that can be used while producing the audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool can automatically generate bios of characters, their relationships, and summarize plot points of different episodes, allowing creators to refer back to these details while writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CoPilot also has a review tool, which checks for plot points, grammar, and leaves qualitative feedback through comments on an episode.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the hood, Pocket FM is training smaller models to maintain context for a story for character arcs and relations, along with narrative consistency. Plus, utilizing signals from users, the startup is nudging AI to add more drama to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-international-expansion-and-localization-plans"&gt;International expansion and localization plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside the arrival of the AI tools, Pocket FM launched adaptation tools for various markets that not only translate the text from one language to another but also change names and phrases that are more suited to that region’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first debuted this tool as a part of the CoPilot suite in Germany earlier this year to convert stories from other regions after reportedly struggling to engage users in the European country last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nayak said the company saw great results from this trial, with a constant increase in monthly in-app revenue, which crossed $700,000 in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036538" height="335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-4.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pocket FM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we started expanding into new regions, it used to take us 12-18 months to meaningfully exist in that market. You have to have at least 1,000 hours of content to start acquiring users and scaling the market. Now we can do this in less than three months,” Nayak said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool increased writer productivity by up to 50% for the German market in terms of show output. Plus, the tool helped the company create more error-free drafts of the shows that resulted in higher user retention for audio series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the U.S., series created with the help of these new AI tools are now contributing 10% of playtime. Plus, these shows have generated $7 million in revenue in the last 12 months while reducing the cost of production by 2-3 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result of adopting different AI features internally, Pocket FM has been able to scale the content quickly. The startup said it launches close to 1,000 pilots per month. And just the sheer volume of content results in a few of them becoming hits.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the audio show is just one part. The company is already working on tools to convert stories into comic strips with its Pocket Toons platform. Plus, Nayak said video is a possible format the company could explore, too. The startup, which has raised over $196 million in funding across rounds, is experimenting with a micro drama app as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036540" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-13-at-12.05.03PM.jpg?w=413" width="413" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By next year, Pocket FM wants to release its own singular large language model (LLM), which will be based on data collected from its shows and incorporate different tools like writing assistance, adoption, dramatization, and story context retention. The company said that when it switches to its own LLM, it won’t need to train a ton of small models for separate features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-s-potential-downsides"&gt;AI’s potential downsides&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adopting AI has had its side effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pocket FM has already laid off people who were employees or contractors across multiple rounds in the last 12 months. There have also been reports of writers seeing diminished returns over time. And the company is facing lawsuits in California over employment and wage issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Like most content-led industries, we work with a diverse network of writers, voice artists, and production partners on a project basis, tailoring resources to each market. AI has had minimal impact on our core creative community; instead, it has opened new avenues to expand reach and output,” a company rep said, in response to these layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are questions around quality, as well. The company measures quality by the retention numbers of a show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The base argument is that the new AI tools act as a writers’ room even for solo creators, so they will be able to produce more content at a rapid rate. Plus, based on the numbers, writers can quickly edit the story with the help of AI. However, these tools can very well induce “AI slop” — or low-quality, AI-generated content — into the platform and could impact a user’s recommendations, making it difficult for them to discover good stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pocket FM argues that stories that have a solid structure will gain popularity, despite AI helping them. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company noted that every piece of content is reviewed by its AI-powered moderation framework to ensure quality and originality. It also claims its AI moderation checks for things like duplication, copyright issues, content health, and other quality measures before approving audio to go live. Each show receives an equal push, and user engagement ultimately determines a show’s ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another concern is that writers could become overly dependent on AI over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Germany, AI is writing more content than humans per show for select titles. With Pocket FM’s plans to roll out more AI tools, the amount of AI-written content could increase. And with that, the expectation of churning out more shows could rise, too. Unless user adoption also rises rapidly, average returns could drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company didn’t directly address TechCrunch’s questions about returns, but said that its AI tools can speed up a writer’s work and help them edit an episode based on numbers and audience feedback. That is they could make targeted improvements, instead of doing a full rewrite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This way, faster content creation doesn’t necessarily dilute quality or relevance; it just shifts the writer’s role towards editing, refining, and steering more productive output,” a spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Fill out&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;this survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to let us know how we’re doing and get the chance to win a prize in return!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;India-based audio series platform maker Pocket FM aims to be the Netflix of audio. That is, the company intends to match its audio series with hundreds of episodes to its users’ tastes. For that to work, it needs to release content rapidly — something it’s now turning to AI to help with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lightspeed-backed startup is giving its writers an AI tool set that can do things like suggest better endings to an episode or make the narrative more engaging. The hope is that the tools will speed up the story-writing process.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pocket FM already uses some AI tools like ElevenLabs to generate voices for audio series. It also tested AI tools for writing and adaptation assistance internally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohan Nayak, Pocket FM’s founder, said it’s rolling out the AI tools to all writers, so it will take them less time to finish their episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3036537" height="334" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-5.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pocket FM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The writing tool, dubbed CoPilot, can be used to help any writer create a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CoPilot can transform narrative-based writing into dialog-based writing for a specific segment. It can also do “beat analysis” to shape the writing in a way to makes it more engaging for an audio series of a particular genre. The tool additionally has basic chatbot-style writing features such as “shorten,” “expand,” and the ability to generate text via a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To build CoPilot, the company examined thousands of hours of data points to understand what makes users engage more with a particular storyline in a specific genre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based on that, it added writing suggestion features designed to increase conflict between characters and recommend endings for an episode to make it more exciting. AI can also suggest tags for background effects that can be used while producing the audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool can automatically generate bios of characters, their relationships, and summarize plot points of different episodes, allowing creators to refer back to these details while writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CoPilot also has a review tool, which checks for plot points, grammar, and leaves qualitative feedback through comments on an episode.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the hood, Pocket FM is training smaller models to maintain context for a story for character arcs and relations, along with narrative consistency. Plus, utilizing signals from users, the startup is nudging AI to add more drama to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-international-expansion-and-localization-plans"&gt;International expansion and localization plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside the arrival of the AI tools, Pocket FM launched adaptation tools for various markets that not only translate the text from one language to another but also change names and phrases that are more suited to that region’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first debuted this tool as a part of the CoPilot suite in Germany earlier this year to convert stories from other regions after reportedly struggling to engage users in the European country last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nayak said the company saw great results from this trial, with a constant increase in monthly in-app revenue, which crossed $700,000 in June.&lt;/p&gt;
