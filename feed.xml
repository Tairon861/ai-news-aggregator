(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/nvidia-ai-chip-ban-china-market-share/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially told the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that China would “win the AI race” before softening his stance, it crystallised a predicament that’s been years in the making. The world’s most valuable chipmaker now finds itself caught between two superpowers, each wielding the Nvidia AI chip ban as a weapon in a broader technological cold war—and the company’s attempt to please both sides may ultimately satisfy neither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-dominance-to-zero-a-market-collapse"&gt;From dominance to zero: A market collapse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell a stark story.&amp;nbsp;Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in October, Huang revealed that Nvidia’s share of China’s AI accelerator market has collapsed from roughly 95% to zero,&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;the company now&amp;nbsp;assuming&amp;nbsp;no revenue from China in its forecasts.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;isn’t just a revenue hiccup—China previously represented between 20% and 25% of Nvidia’s data centre revenue, a segment that generated more than US$41 billion in its most recent financial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest blow came this week when&amp;nbsp;sources&amp;nbsp;claimed that the White House informed federal agencies it will not permit Nvidia to sell its latest scaled-down AI chips to China, specifically the B30A chip designed to train large language models. Despite Nvidia providing samples to Chinese customers and reportedly working to modify the design, the Trump administration has drawn a hard line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Washington’s restrictions represent only half of Nvidia’s problem. Beijing has issued guidance requiring new data centre projects receiving state funds to use only domestically-made AI chips, with projects less than 30% complete ordered to remove all installed foreign chips or cancel purchase plans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a pincer movement that leaves Nvidia with virtually no room to manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-lobbying-game-too-much-too-late"&gt;The lobbying game: Too much, too late?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huang has long argued that maintaining China’s dependence on American hardware serves US interests. His logic? Keep Chinese AI developers hooked on Nvidia’s ecosystem, and America retains technological leverage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following meetings with President Trump in July, it appeared Huang’s lobbying had worked, with Washington agreeing to ease some chip curbs under a plan&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;Nvidia and AMD would pay the US government 15% of their Chinese revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That optimism proved short-lived. Beijing has since shut Nvidia out of the market through a national security review of its chips, with Huang stating the firm’s market share has&amp;nbsp;been reduced&amp;nbsp;to zero. The irony is palpable: while Huang lobbied Washington to allow more sales to China, Beijing was simultaneously building barriers to keep Nvidia out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Huang contrasted China’s pro-industry energy subsidies with what he described as excessive Western regulation, it revealed the fundamental tension in Nvidia’s position. The company needs a favourable policy from both capitals, but operates in an environment where pleasing one increasingly means antagonising the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-cost-of-technological-nationalism"&gt;The cost of technological nationalism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;isn’t merely a corporate problem—it’s reshaping the global AI landscape.&amp;nbsp;China’s ban would eliminate foreign chipmakers like Nvidia from a significant portion of the market, even if a deal is&amp;nbsp;agreed&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;allow the resumption ofadvanced chip sales to China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Chinese companies have over US$100 billion in state funding for AI data centre projects since 2021, creating a massive captive market for domestic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy whiplash has real consequences. Following Trump’s meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, highly anticipated trade talks yielded no concessions from either side on chip policy, with top US officials rallying against Trump’s initial consideration of Huang’s request to allow sales of new AI chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Nvidia spokesperson’s response to the latest restrictions was telling&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;: “zero share in China’s highly competitive market for datacenter compute, and do not include it in our guidance”. It’s a public acknowledgement of defeat wrapped in corporate speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-s-calculated-response"&gt;China’s calculated response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s moves reveal a strategy that extends beyond mere retaliation. China has discouraged local tech giants from purchasing advanced Nvidia chips over security concerns this year, while showing off a new data centre powered solely by domestic AI chips. The message is clear: foreign dependence is a vulnerability to&amp;nbsp;be eliminated, not managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government is carving out market share for domestic chipmakers ranging from Huawei Technologies to smaller players like Shanghai-listed Cambricon and startups including MetaX, Moore Threads, and Enflame.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these companies struggle to match Nvidia’s performance and software ecosystem, they’re getting exactly what they need most: time, money, and a protected market to mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-impossible-balance"&gt;The impossible balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s predicament exposes a broader truth about technology in an era of great power competition: the middle ground is disappearing. Companies can optimise for American national security priorities or Chinese market access, but increasingly not both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huang expressed concerns that the West was&amp;nbsp;being held back&amp;nbsp;by “cynicism” and excessive regulation, contrasting this with China’s energy subsidies aimed at lowering costs for local developers using domestic chips. But this comparison misses the point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether China’s industrial policy is more effective—it’s whether Nvidia can operate in an environment where technology has become inseparable from geopolitics. The B30A saga illustrates the futility of technical compromises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a chip deliberately neutered to comply with US export controls finds no approval from Washington, while Beijing increasingly views any foreign chip as a strategic vulnerability. Nvidia could design a thousand variants, each weaker than the last, and still find itself shut out by one capital or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-comes-next"&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, Nvidia faces a stark reality: the company now assumes 0% revenue from China in all forecasts, with Huang stating, “If anything happens in China… it will be a bonus”. This conservative guidance protects the stock but signals that management sees no near-term resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real question is whether this represents a temporary freeze or a permanent fracture. While the move helps boost sales of domestically developed chips, it also risks widening the US-China gap in AI computing power, as US tech giants continue spending hundreds of billions on data centres powered by Nvidia’s most advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nvidia, the path forward likely involves doubling down on markets where geopolitics align with business—the US, Europe, and&amp;nbsp;friendly Asian nations. The China dream, at least in its previous form, appears over. Huang’s softening of his “China will win” comments reflects this new reality. America might not win by keeping China dependent on its chips, but Nvidia certainly loses by being caught in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nvidia AI chip ban—from both directions—represents more than&amp;nbsp;export controls or industrial policy. It’s evidence that in the AI race, there won’t be neutral suppliers. Technology companies will increasingly&amp;nbsp;be forced&amp;nbsp;to choose sides, and those who hesitate will find the choice made for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s plunge from 95% to zero market share in China took just months. The question now is whether Washington and Beijing will leave any space for global tech companies to operate at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo b&lt;/em&gt;y OpenAI and Nvidia plan $100B chip deal for AI future)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft AI research team working on humanist superintelligence project" class="wp-image-110411" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The former quarterback revealed that his Junie is actually a clone of Lua, a pit bull mix that died in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brady’s announcement follows those of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Barbra Streisand, who also famously cloned their pet dogs. But some believe there are better ways to make use of cloning technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the pampered pooches of the rich and famous may dominate this week’s headlines, cloning technologies are also being used to diversify the genetic pools of inbred species and potentially bring other animals back from the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloning itself isn’t new. &lt;/strong&gt;The first mammal cloned from an adult cell, Dolly the sheep, was born in the 1990s. The technology has been used in livestock breeding over the decades since.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Say you’ve got a particularly large bull, or a cow that has an especially high milk yield. Those animals are valuable. You could selectively breed for those kinds of characteristics. Or you could clone the original animals—essentially creating genetic twins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists can take some of the animals’ cells, freeze them, and store them in a biobank. &lt;/strong&gt;That opens&amp;nbsp;the option to clone them in the future. It’s possible to thaw those cells, remove the DNA-containing nuclei of the cells, and insert them into donor egg cells.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Those donor egg cells, which come from another animal of the same species, have their own nuclei removed. So it’s a case of swapping out the DNA. The resulting cell is stimulated and grown in the lab until it starts to look like an embryo. Then it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate animal—which eventually gives birth to a clone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a handful of companies offering to clone pets. &lt;/strong&gt;Viagen, which claims to have “cloned more animals than anyone else on Earth,” will clone a dog or cat for $50,000. That’s the company that cloned Streisand’s pet dog Samantha, twice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This week, Colossal Biosciences—the “de-extinction” company that claims to have resurrected the dire wolf and&amp;nbsp;created a “woolly mouse” as a precursor to reviving the woolly mammoth—announced that it had acquired Viagen, but that Viagen&amp;nbsp;will “continue to operate under its current leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet cloning is controversial, for a few reasons. &lt;/strong&gt;The companies themselves point out that, while the cloned animal will be a genetic twin of the original animal, it won’t be identical. One issue is mitochondrial DNA—a tiny fraction of DNA that sits outside the nucleus and is inherited from the mother. The cloned animal may inherit some of this from the surrogate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is unlikely to have much of an impact on the animal itself. More important are the many, many factors thought to shape an individual’s personality and temperament. “It’s the old nature-versus-nurture question,” says Samantha Wisely, a conservation geneticist at the University of Florida. After all, human identical twins are never carbon copies of each other. Anyone who clones a pet expecting a like-for-like reincarnation is likely to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some animal welfare groups are opposed to the practice of pet cloning. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) described it as “a horror show,” and the UK’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) says that “there is&amp;nbsp;no justification for cloning animals for such trivial purposes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there are other uses for cloning technology that are arguably less trivial. &lt;/strong&gt;Wisely has long been interested in diversifying the gene pool of the critically endangered black-footed ferret, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, there are around 10,000 black-footed ferrets that have been captively bred from only seven individuals, says Wisely. That level of inbreeding isn’t good for any species—it tends to leave organisms at risk of poor health. They are less able to reproduce or adapt to changes in their environment.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Wisely and her colleagues had access to frozen tissue samples taken from two other ferrets. Along with colleagues at not-for-profit Revive and Restore, the team created clones of those two individuals. The first clone, Elizabeth Ann,&amp;nbsp;was born in 2020. Since then, other clones have been born, and the team has started breeding the cloned animals with the descendants of the other seven ferrets, says Wisely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same approach has been used to&amp;nbsp;clone the endangered Przewalski’s horse, using decades-old tissue samples stored by the San Diego Zoo. It’s too soon to predict the impact of these efforts. Researchers are still evaluating the cloned ferrets and their offspring to see if they behave like typical animals and could survive in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even this practice is not without its critics. &lt;/strong&gt;Some have pointed out that cloning alone will not save any species. After all, it doesn’t address the habitat loss or human-wildlife conflict that is responsible for the endangerment of these animals in the first place. And there will always be detractors who accuse people who clone animals of “playing God.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all her involvement in cloning endangered ferrets, Wisely tells me she would not consider cloning her own pets. She currently has three rescue dogs, a rescue cat, and “geriatric chickens.” “I love them all dearly,” she says. “But there are a lot of rescue animals out there that need homes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

But some believe there are better ways to make use of cloning technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the pampered pooches of the rich and famous may dominate this week’s headlines, cloning technologies are also being used to diversify the genetic pools of inbred species and potentially bring other animals back from the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloning itself isn’t new. &lt;/strong&gt;The first mammal cloned from an adult cell, Dolly the sheep, was born in the 1990s. The technology has been used in livestock breeding over the decades since.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Say you’ve got a particularly large bull, or a cow that has an especially high milk yield. Those animals are valuable. You could selectively breed for those kinds of characteristics. Or you could clone the original animals—essentially creating genetic twins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists can take some of the animals’ cells, freeze them, and store them in a biobank. &lt;/strong&gt;That opens&amp;nbsp;the option to clone them in the future. It’s possible to thaw those cells, remove the DNA-containing nuclei of the cells, and insert them into donor egg cells.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Those donor egg cells, which come from another animal of the same species, have their own nuclei removed. So it’s a case of swapping out the DNA. The resulting cell is stimulated and grown in the lab until it starts to look like an embryo. Then it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate animal—which eventually gives birth to a clone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a handful of companies offering to clone pets. &lt;/strong&gt;Viagen, which claims to have “cloned more animals than anyone else on Earth,” will clone a dog or cat for $50,000. That’s the company that cloned Streisand’s pet dog Samantha, twice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This week, Colossal Biosciences—the “de-extinction” company that claims to have resurrected the dire wolf and&amp;nbsp;created a “woolly mouse” as a precursor to reviving the woolly mammoth—announced that it had acquired Viagen, but that Viagen&amp;nbsp;will “continue to operate under its current leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet cloning is controversial, for a few reasons. &lt;/strong&gt;The companies themselves point out that, while the cloned animal will be a genetic twin of the original animal, it won’t be identical. One issue is mitochondrial DNA—a tiny fraction of DNA that sits outside the nucleus and is inherited from the mother. The cloned animal may inherit some of this from the surrogate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is unlikely to have much of an impact on the animal itself. More important are the many, many factors thought to shape an individual’s personality and temperament. “It’s the old nature-versus-nurture question,” says Samantha Wisely, a conservation geneticist at the University of Florida. After all, human identical twins are never carbon copies of each other. Anyone who clones a pet expecting a like-for-like reincarnation is likely to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some animal welfare groups are opposed to the practice of pet cloning. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) described it as “a horror show,” and the UK’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) says that “there is&amp;nbsp;no justification for cloning animals for such trivial purposes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there are other uses for cloning technology that are arguably less trivial. &lt;/strong&gt;Wisely has long been interested in diversifying the gene pool of the critically endangered black-footed ferret, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, there are around 10,000 black-footed ferrets that have been captively bred from only seven individuals, says Wisely. That level of inbreeding isn’t good for any species—it tends to leave organisms at risk of poor health. They are less able to reproduce or adapt to changes in their environment.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Wisely and her colleagues had access to frozen tissue samples taken from two other ferrets. Along with colleagues at not-for-profit Revive and Restore, the team created clones of those two individuals. The first clone, Elizabeth Ann,&amp;nbsp;was born in 2020. Since then, other clones have been born, and the team has started breeding the cloned animals with the descendants of the other seven ferrets, says Wisely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same approach has been used to&amp;nbsp;clone the endangered Przewalski’s horse, using decades-old tissue samples stored by the San Diego Zoo. It’s too soon to predict the impact of these efforts. Researchers are still evaluating the cloned ferrets and their offspring to see if they behave like typical animals and could survive in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even this practice is not without its critics. &lt;/strong&gt;Some have pointed out that cloning alone will not save any species. After all, it doesn’t address the habitat loss or human-wildlife conflict that is responsible for the endangerment of these animals in the first place. And there will always be detractors who accuse people who clone animals of “playing God.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all her involvement in cloning endangered ferrets, Wisely tells me she would not consider cloning her own pets. She currently has three rescue dogs, a rescue cat, and “geriatric chickens.” “I love them all dearly,” she says. “But there are a lot of rescue animals out there that need homes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

It has long, gray banquettes that convert into bunks, a microwave cleverly hidden under a counter, a functional steel sink with a French press and crockery above. A weird little toilet hides behind a curtain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some clues hint that you can’t just fire up Vanguard’s engine and roll off the lot. The least subtle is its door, a massive disc of steel complete with a wheel that spins to lock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vanguard subsea human habitat from the outside door." class="wp-image-1127708" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MarkHarris_20251029_171637167.MP_.jpg?w=2363" width="2363" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY MARK HARRIS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it is sealed and moved to its permanent home beneath the waves of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary early next year, Vanguard will be the world’s first new subsea habitat in nearly four decades. Teams of four scientists will live and work on the seabed for a week at a time, entering and leaving the habitat as scuba divers. Their missions could include reef restoration, species surveys, underwater archaeology, or even astronaut training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of Vanguard’s modules, unappetizingly named the “wet porch,” has a permanent opening in the floor (a.k.a. a “moon pool”) that doesn’t flood because Vanguard’s air pressure is matched to the water around it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It is this pressurization that makes the habitat so useful. Scuba divers working at its maximum operational depth of 50 meters would typically need to make a lengthy stop on their way back to the surface to avoid decompression sickness. This painful and potentially fatal condition, better known as the bends, develops if divers surface too quickly. A traditional 50-meter dive gives scuba divers only a handful of minutes on the seafloor, and they can make only a couple of such dives a day. With Vanguard’s atmosphere at the same pressure as the water, its aquanauts need to decompress only once, at the end of their stay. They can potentially dive for many hours every day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could unlock all kinds of new science and exploration. “More time in the ocean opens a world of possibility, accelerating discoveries, inspiration, solutions,” said Kristen Tertoole, Deep’s chief operating officer, at Vanguard’s unveiling in Miami in October. “The ocean is Earth’s life support system. It regulates our climate, sustains life, and holds mysteries we’ve only begun to explore, but it remains 95% undiscovered.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vanguard subsea human habitat unveiled in Miami" class="wp-image-1127705" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CourtesyDEEP_Vanguard-subsea-human-habitat-unveiled-in-Miami.jpg?w=2144" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY DEEP&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subsea habitats are not a new invention. Jacques Cousteau (naturally) built the first in 1962, although it was only about the size of an elevator. Larger habitats followed in the 1970s and ’80s, maxing out at around the size of Vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the technology has come a long way since then. Vanguard uses a tethered connection to a buoy above, known as the “surface expression,” that pipes fresh air and water down to the habitat. It also hosts a diesel generator to power a Starlink internet connection and a tank to hold wastewater. Norman Smith, Deep’s chief technology officer, says the company modeled the most severe hurricanes that Florida expects over the next 20 years and designed the tether to withstand them. Even if the worst happens and the link is broken, Deep says, Vanguard has enough air, water, and energy storage to support its crew for at least 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That number came from DNV, an independent classification agency that inspects and certifies all types of marine vessels so that they can get commercial insurance. Vanguard will be the first subsea habitat to get a DNV classification. “That means you have to deal with the rules and all the challenging, frustrating things that come along with it, but it means that on a foundational level, it’s going to be safe,” says Patrick Lahey, founder of Triton Submarines, a manufacturer of classed submersibles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An interior view of Vanguard during Life Under The Sea: Ocean Engineering and Technology Company DEEP's unveiling of Vanguard, its pilot subsea human habitat at The Hangar at Regatta Harbour on October 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida." class="wp-image-1127704" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244006535.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JASON KOERNER/GETTY IMAGES FOR DEEP&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Deep hopes Vanguard itself will enable decades of useful science, its prime function for the company is to prove out technologies for its planned successor, an advanced modular habitat called Sentinel. Sentinel modules will be six meters wide, twice the diameter of Vanguard, complete with sweeping staircases and single-occupant cabins. A small deployment might have a crew of eight, about the same as the International Space Station. A big Sentinel system could house 50, up to 225 meters deep. Deep claims that Sentinel will be launched at some point in 2027.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, according to its mission statement, Deep seeks to “make humans aquatic,” an indication that permanent communities are on its long-term road map.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Deep has not publicly disclosed the identity of its principal funder, but business records in the UK indicate that as of January 31, 2025 a Canadian man, Robert MacGregor, owned at least 75% of its holding company. According to a Reuters investigation, MacGregor was once linked with Craig Steven Wright, a computer scientist who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, as bitcoin’s elusive creator is pseudonymously known. However, Wright’s claims to be Nakamoto later collapsed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MacGregor has kept a very low public profile in recent years. When contacted for comment, Deep spokesperson Mike Bohan refused to comment on the link with Wright, only to say it was inaccurate, but said: “Robert MacGregor started his career as an IP lawyer in the dot-com era, moving into blockchain technology and has diverse interests including philanthropy, real estate, and now Deep.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, MacGregor could find keeping that low profile more difficult if Vanguard is successful in reinvigorating ocean science and exploration as the company hopes. The habitat is due to be deployed early next year, following final operational tests at Triton’s facility in Florida. It will welcome its first scientists shortly after.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The ocean is not just our resource; it is our responsibility,” says Tertoole. “Deep is more than a single habitat.

He said he will head the group and that Microsoft plans to put “a lot of money” behind the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are doing this to solve real, concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,” Suleyman wrote. “We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a ‘humanist’ approach to superintelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as big tech companies race to attract top AI researchers. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, recently created its own Meta Superintelligence Labs and spent billions recruiting experts, even offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million. Suleyman didn’t comment on whether Microsoft plans to match such offers but said the new team will include both internal talent and new hires, with Karen Simonyan as chief scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Microsoft, Suleyman co-founded DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. He later led the AI startup Inflection, which Microsoft acquired last year along with several of its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiring push reflects a broader trend. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, companies have raced to bring generative AI into their products. Microsoft uses OpenAI’s models in Bing and Copilot, while OpenAI relies on Microsoft’s Azure cloud to power its tools. Microsoft also holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI after a recent restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reducing reliance on OpenAI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the partnership, Microsoft has been working to diversify its AI sources as it lays the groundwork for future superintelligence research. Following the Inflection acquisition, the company began experimenting with models from Google and Anthropic, another AI startup founded by former OpenAI executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Microsoft AI research group will aim to build useful AI companions that assist people in education and other areas. Suleyman said the team also plans to focus on projects in medicine and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A different path from rivals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some peers, Suleyman said Microsoft isn’t trying to build an “infinitely capable generalist” AI. He doubts such systems could be kept under control and instead wants to develop what he calls “humanist superintelligence” – AI that serves human needs and delivers real-world benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humanism requires us to always ask the question: does this technology serve human interests?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the risks of AI are widely debated – from bias to existential threats – Suleyman said his team’s goal is to create specialist systems that achieve “superhuman performance” without posing major risks. He cited examples like AI that could improve battery storage or design new molecules, similar to DeepMind’s AlphaFold project that predicts protein structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medical superintelligence on the horizon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman said Microsoft is especially focused on healthcare, predicting that AI capable of expert-level diagnosis could emerge in the next two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described it as technology that can reason through complex medical problems and detect preventable diseases much earlier. “We’ll have expert-level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As investors question whether massive AI spending will translate into profits, Suleyman emphasised that Microsoft is setting clear limits. “We are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Praswin Prakashan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Microsoft gives free Copilot AI services to US government workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

 &lt;p&gt;The fertile river valleys of the American Midwest hide tens of thousands of Indigenous earthworks, according to experts: geometric structures consisting of walls, mounds, ditches, and berms, some dating back nearly 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists now believe that the earthworks functioned as religious gathering places, tombs for culturally important clans, and annual calendars, perhaps all at the same time. They can take the form of giant circles and squares, cloverleafs and octagons, complex S-curves and simple mounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it seemed as if much of the continent’s pre-European archaeological heritage had been carelessly wiped out, uprooted, and lost for good. But traces remain: electromagnetic remnants in the soil that can be detected using specialty surveying equipment. And archaeologists and tribal historians are working together to uncover them.

 &lt;p&gt;The fertile river valleys of the American Midwest hide tens of thousands of Indigenous earthworks, according to experts: geometric structures consisting of walls, mounds, ditches, and berms, some dating back nearly 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists now believe that the earthworks functioned as religious gathering places, tombs for culturally important clans, and annual calendars, perhaps all at the same time. They can take the form of giant circles and squares, cloverleafs and octagons, complex S-curves and simple mounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it seemed as if much of the continent’s pre-European archaeological heritage had been carelessly wiped out, uprooted, and lost for good. But traces remain: electromagnetic remnants in the soil that can be detected using specialty surveying equipment. And archaeologists and tribal historians are working together to uncover them.

      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, extremely personal and sensitive ChatGPT conversations have been leaking into an unexpected destination: Google Search Console (GSC), a tool that developers typically use to monitor search traffic, not lurk private chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, when site managers access GSC performance reports, they see queries based on keywords or short phrases that Internet users type into Google to find relevant content. But starting this September, odd queries, sometimes more than 300 characters long, could also be found in GSC. Showing only user inputs, the chats appeared to be from unwitting people prompting a chatbot to help solve relationship or business problems, who likely expected those conversations would remain private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Packer, owner of an analytics consulting firm called Quantable, was among the first to flag the issue in a detailed blog last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to figure out what exactly was causing the leaks, he teamed up with “Internet sleuth” and web optimization consultant Slobodan Manić. Together, they conducted testing that they believe may have surfaced “the first definitive proof that OpenAI directly scrapes Google Search with actual user prompts.” Their investigation seemed to confirm the AI giant was compromising user privacy, in some cases in order to maintain engagement by seizing search data that Google otherwise wouldn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI declined Ars’ request to confirm if Packer and Manić’s theory posed in their blog was correct or answer any of their remaining questions that could help users determine the scope of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company was “aware” of the issue and has since “resolved” a glitch “that temporarily affected how a small number of search queries were routed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer told Ars that he’s “very pleased that OpenAI was able to resolve the issue quickly.” But he suggested that OpenAI’s response failed to confirm whether or not OpenAI was scraping Google, and that leaves room for doubt that the issue was completely resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Weirder” than prior ChatGPT leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first odd ChatGPT query to appear in GSC that Packer reviewed was a wacky stream-of-consciousness from a likely female user asking ChatGPT to assess certain behaviors to help her figure out if a boy who teases her had feelings for her. Another odd query seemed to come from an office manager sharing business information while plotting a return-to-office announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were just two of 200 odd queries—including “some pretty crazy ones,” Packer told Ars—that he reviewed on one site alone. In his blog, Packer concluded that the queries should serve as “a reminder that prompts aren’t as private as you think they are!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer suspected that these queries were connected to reporting from The Information in August that cited sources claiming OpenAI was scraping Google search results to power ChatGPT responses. Sources claimed that OpenAI was leaning on Google to answer prompts to ChatGPT seeking information about current events, like news or sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has not confirmed that it’s scraping Google search engine results pages (SERPs). However, Packer thinks his testing of ChatGPT leaks may be evidence that OpenAI not only scrapes “SERPs in general to acquire data,” but also sends user prompts to Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manić helped Packer solve a big part of the riddle. He found that the odd queries were turning up in one site’s GSC because it ranked highly in Google Search for “https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/”—a ChatGPT URL that was appended at the start of every strange query turning up in GSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that Google had tokenized the URL, breaking it up into a search for keywords “openai + index + chatgpt.” Sites using GSC that ranked highly for those keywords were therefore likely to encounter ChatGPT leaks, Parker and Manić proposed, including sites that covered prior ChatGPT leaks where chats were being indexed in Google search results. Using their recommendations to seek out queries in GSC, Ars was able to verify similar strings.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get confused though, this is a new and completely different ChatGPT screw-up than having Google index stuff we don’t want them to,” Packer wrote. “Weirder, if not as serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what exactly OpenAI fixed, but Packer and Manić have a theory about one possible path for leaking chats. Visiting the URL that starts every strange query found in GSC, ChatGPT users encounter a prompt box that seemed buggy, causing “the URL of that page to be added to the prompt.” The issue, they explained, seemed to be that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally ChatGPT 5 will choose to do a web search whenever it thinks it needs to, and is more likely to do that with an esoteric or recency-requiring search. But this bugged prompt box also contains the query parameter ‘hints=search’ to cause it to basically always do a search: https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search&amp;amp;openaicom_referred=true&amp;amp;model=gpt-5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly some of those searches relied on Google, Packer’s blog said, mistakenly sending to GSC “whatever” the user says in the prompt box, with “https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/” text added to the front of it.” As Packer explained, “we know it must have scraped those rather than using an API or some kind of private connection—because those other options don’t show inside GSC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means “that OpenAI is sharing any prompt that requires a Google Search with both Google and whoever is doing their scraping,” Packer alleged. “And then also with whoever’s site shows up in the search results! Yikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Packer, it appeared that “ALL ChatGPT prompts” that used Google Search risked being leaked during the past two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI claimed only a small number of queries were leaked but declined to provide a more precise estimate. So, it remains unclear how many of the 700 million people who use ChatGPT each week had prompts routed to GSC.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI’s response leaves users with “lingering questions”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ChatGPT prompts were found surfacing in Google’s search index in August, OpenAI clarified that users had clicked a box making those prompts public, which OpenAI defended as “sufficiently clear.” The AI firm later scrambled to remove the chats from Google’s SERPs after it became obvious that users felt misled into sharing private chats publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer told Ars that a major difference between those leaks and the GSC leaks is that users harmed by the prior scandal, at least on some level, “had to actively share” their leaked chats. In the more recent case, “nobody clicked share” or had a reasonable way to prevent their chats from being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did OpenAI go so fast that they didn’t consider the privacy implications of this, or did they just not care?” Packer posited in his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most troubling to some users—whose identities are not linked in chats unless their prompts perhaps share identifying information—there does not seem to be any way to remove the leaked chats from GSC, unlike the prior scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer and Manić are left with “lingering questions” about how far OpenAI’s fix will go to stop the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manić was hoping OpenAI might confirm if prompts entered on https://chatgpt.com that trigger Google Search were also affected. But OpenAI did not follow up on that question, or a broader question about how big the leak was. To Manić, a major concern was that OpenAI’s scraping may be “contributing to ‘crocodile mouth’ in Google Search Console,” a troubling trend SEO researchers have flagged that causes impressions to spike but clicks to dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also declined to clarify Packer’s biggest question. He’s left wondering if the company’s “fix” simply ended OpenAI’s “routing of search queries, such that raw prompts are no longer being sent to Google Search, or are they no longer scraping Google Search at all for data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know if it’s that one particular page that has this bug or whether this is really widespread,” Packer told Ars. “In either case, it’s serious and just sort of shows how little regard OpenAI has for moving carefully when it comes to privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, extremely personal and sensitive ChatGPT conversations have been leaking into an unexpected destination: Google Search Console (GSC), a tool that developers typically use to monitor search traffic, not lurk private chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, when site managers access GSC performance reports, they see queries based on keywords or short phrases that Internet users type into Google to find relevant content. But starting this September, odd queries, sometimes more than 300 characters long, could also be found in GSC. Showing only user inputs, the chats appeared to be from unwitting people prompting a chatbot to help solve relationship or business problems, who likely expected those conversations would remain private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Packer, owner of an analytics consulting firm called Quantable, was among the first to flag the issue in a detailed blog last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to figure out what exactly was causing the leaks, he teamed up with “Internet sleuth” and web optimization consultant Slobodan Manić. Together, they conducted testing that they believe may have surfaced “the first definitive proof that OpenAI directly scrapes Google Search with actual user prompts.” Their investigation seemed to confirm the AI giant was compromising user privacy, in some cases in order to maintain engagement by seizing search data that Google otherwise wouldn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI declined Ars’ request to confirm if Packer and Manić’s theory posed in their blog was correct or answer any of their remaining questions that could help users determine the scope of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company was “aware” of the issue and has since “resolved” a glitch “that temporarily affected how a small number of search queries were routed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer told Ars that he’s “very pleased that OpenAI was able to resolve the issue quickly.” But he suggested that OpenAI’s response failed to confirm whether or not OpenAI was scraping Google, and that leaves room for doubt that the issue was completely resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Weirder” than prior ChatGPT leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first odd ChatGPT query to appear in GSC that Packer reviewed was a wacky stream-of-consciousness from a likely female user asking ChatGPT to assess certain behaviors to help her figure out if a boy who teases her had feelings for her. Another odd query seemed to come from an office manager sharing business information while plotting a return-to-office announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were just two of 200 odd queries—including “some pretty crazy ones,” Packer told Ars—that he reviewed on one site alone. In his blog, Packer concluded that the queries should serve as “a reminder that prompts aren’t as private as you think they are!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer suspected that these queries were connected to reporting from The Information in August that cited sources claiming OpenAI was scraping Google search results to power ChatGPT responses. Sources claimed that OpenAI was leaning on Google to answer prompts to ChatGPT seeking information about current events, like news or sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has not confirmed that it’s scraping Google search engine results pages (SERPs). However, Packer thinks his testing of ChatGPT leaks may be evidence that OpenAI not only scrapes “SERPs in general to acquire data,” but also sends user prompts to Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manić helped Packer solve a big part of the riddle. He found that the odd queries were turning up in one site’s GSC because it ranked highly in Google Search for “https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/”—a ChatGPT URL that was appended at the start of every strange query turning up in GSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that Google had tokenized the URL, breaking it up into a search for keywords “openai + index + chatgpt.” Sites using GSC that ranked highly for those keywords were therefore likely to encounter ChatGPT leaks, Parker and Manić proposed, including sites that covered prior ChatGPT leaks where chats were being indexed in Google search results. Using their recommendations to seek out queries in GSC, Ars was able to verify similar strings.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get confused though, this is a new and completely different ChatGPT screw-up than having Google index stuff we don’t want them to,” Packer wrote. “Weirder, if not as serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what exactly OpenAI fixed, but Packer and Manić have a theory about one possible path for leaking chats. Visiting the URL that starts every strange query found in GSC, ChatGPT users encounter a prompt box that seemed buggy, causing “the URL of that page to be added to the prompt.” The issue, they explained, seemed to be that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally ChatGPT 5 will choose to do a web search whenever it thinks it needs to, and is more likely to do that with an esoteric or recency-requiring search. But this bugged prompt box also contains the query parameter ‘hints=search’ to cause it to basically always do a search: https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search&amp;amp;openaicom_referred=true&amp;amp;model=gpt-5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly some of those searches relied on Google, Packer’s blog said, mistakenly sending to GSC “whatever” the user says in the prompt box, with “https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/” text added to the front of it.” As Packer explained, “we know it must have scraped those rather than using an API or some kind of private connection—because those other options don’t show inside GSC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means “that OpenAI is sharing any prompt that requires a Google Search with both Google and whoever is doing their scraping,” Packer alleged. “And then also with whoever’s site shows up in the search results! Yikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Packer, it appeared that “ALL ChatGPT prompts” that used Google Search risked being leaked during the past two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI claimed only a small number of queries were leaked but declined to provide a more precise estimate. So, it remains unclear how many of the 700 million people who use ChatGPT each week had prompts routed to GSC.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI’s response leaves users with “lingering questions”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ChatGPT prompts were found surfacing in Google’s search index in August, OpenAI clarified that users had clicked a box making those prompts public, which OpenAI defended as “sufficiently clear.” The AI firm later scrambled to remove the chats from Google’s SERPs after it became obvious that users felt misled into sharing private chats publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer told Ars that a major difference between those leaks and the GSC leaks is that users harmed by the prior scandal, at least on some level, “had to actively share” their leaked chats. In the more recent case, “nobody clicked share” or had a reasonable way to prevent their chats from being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did OpenAI go so fast that they didn’t consider the privacy implications of this, or did they just not care?” Packer posited in his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most troubling to some users—whose identities are not linked in chats unless their prompts perhaps share identifying information—there does not seem to be any way to remove the leaked chats from GSC, unlike the prior scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer and Manić are left with “lingering questions” about how far OpenAI’s fix will go to stop the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manić was hoping OpenAI might confirm if prompts entered on https://chatgpt.com that trigger Google Search were also affected. But OpenAI did not follow up on that question, or a broader question about how big the leak was. To Manić, a major concern was that OpenAI’s scraping may be “contributing to ‘crocodile mouth’ in Google Search Console,” a troubling trend SEO researchers have flagged that causes impressions to spike but clicks to dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also declined to clarify Packer’s biggest question. He’s left wondering if the company’s “fix” simply ended OpenAI’s “routing of search queries, such that raw prompts are no longer being sent to Google Search, or are they no longer scraping Google Search at all for data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know if it’s that one particular page that has this bug or whether this is really widespread,” Packer told Ars. “In either case, it’s serious and just sort of shows how little regard OpenAI has for moving carefully when it comes to privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a Vanity Fair interview, Kim Kardashian — who has been studying to become a lawyer — discussed her “toxic” friendship with ChatGPT, admitting that she has failed law exams after it told her false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I use [ChatGPT] for legal advice, so when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I will take a picture and snap it and put it in there,” she said. “They’re always wrong. It has made me fail tests… And then I’ll get mad and I’ll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail!’” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is prone to hallucinations, meaning that the LLM will create fake answers sometimes, rather than admit that it cannot confidently respond to a prompt. This technology isn’t necessarily programmed to know what information is “correct” or not — rather, it is trained on an unfathomably massive heap of data and prompted to predict the most likely response to an input, which may not be factually accurate. Some lawyers have been sanctioned for using ChatGPT when writing legal briefs, which becomes obvious to those reviewing the briefs, since they cite cases that don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kardashian said she will try to appeal to ChatGPT’s emotions after it lets her down — but this is a futile plan, since ChatGPT does not have feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you’re going to make me fail, how does that make you feel that you need to really know these answers?’” she said. “And then it’ll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts.’”&lt;/p&gt;

However, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), a few fundamental challenges persist, especially around continual learning, the ability for a model to actively acquire new knowledge and skills over time without forgetting old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to continual learning and self-improvement, the human brain is the gold standard. It adapts through neuroplasticity — the remarkable capacity to change its structure in response to new experiences, memories, and learning. Without this ability, a person is limited to immediate context (like anterograde amnesia). We see a similar limitation in current LLMs: their knowledge is confined to either the immediate context of their input window or the static information that they learn during pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple approach, continually updating a model's parameters with new data, often leads to “catastrophic forgetting” (CF), where learning new tasks sacrifices proficiency on old tasks. Researchers traditionally combat CF through architectural tweaks or better optimization rules. However, for too long, we have treated the model's architecture (the network structure) and the optimization algorithm (the training rule) as two separate things, which prevents us from achieving a truly unified, efficient learning system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our paper, “Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures”, published at NeurIPS 2025, we introduce Nested Learning, which bridges this gap. Nested Learning treats a single ML model not as one continuous process, but as a system of interconnected, multi-level learning problems that are optimized simultaneously. We argue that the model's architecture and the rules used to train it (i.e., the optimization algorithm) are fundamentally the same concepts; they are just different "levels" of optimization, each with its own internal flow of information ("context flow") and update rate. By recognizing this inherent structure, Nested Learning provides a new, previously invisible dimension for designing more capable AI, allowing us to build learning components with deeper computational depth, which ultimately helps solve issues like catastrophic forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We test and validate Nested Learning through a proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture that we call “Hope”, which achieves superior performance in language modeling and demonstrates better long-context memory management than existing state-of-the-art models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last decade has seen incredible progress in machine learning (ML), primarily driven by powerful neural network architectures and the algorithms used to train them.
