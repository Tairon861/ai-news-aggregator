Bean counting can seem short-sighted in the face of exciting opportunities for business transformation and competitive dominance. But money is always an object. And when the tech is AI, those beans can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s value is becoming evident in areas like operational efficiency, worker productivity, and customer satisfaction. However, this comes at a cost. The key to long-term success is understanding the relationship between the two — so you can ensure that the potential of AI translates into real, positive impact for your business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The AI acceleration paradox&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI is helping to transform business operations, its own financial footprint often remains obscure. If you can’t connect costs to impact, how can you be sure your AI investments will drive meaningful ROI? This uncertainty makes it no surprise that in the 2025 Gartner® &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence"&gt;Hype Cycle™ for Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, GenAI has moved into the “Trough of Disillusionment” . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective strategic planning depends on clarity. In its absence, decision-making falls back on guesswork and gut instinct. And there’s a lot riding on these decisions. According to Apptio research, 68% of technology leaders surveyed expect to increase their AI budgets, and 39% believe AI will be their departments’ biggest driver of future budget growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bigger budgets don’t guarantee better outcomes. Gartner® also reveals that “despite an average spend of $1.9 million on GenAI initiatives in 2024, fewer than 30% of AI leaders say their CEOs are satisfied with the return on investment.” If there’s no clear link between cost and outcome, organizations risk scaling investments without scaling the value they’re meant to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward with well-founded confidence, business leaders in finance, IT, and tech must collaborate to gain visibility into AI’s financial blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hidden financial risks of AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runaway costs of AI can give IT leaders flashbacks to the early days of public cloud. When it’s easy for DevOps teams and business units to procure their own resources on an OpEx basis, costs and inefficiencies can quickly spiral. In fact, AI projects are avid consumers of cloud infrastructure — while incurring additional costs for data platforms and engineering resources. And that’s on top of the tokens used for each query. The decentralized nature of these costs makes them particularly difficult to attribute to business outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the cloud, the ease of AI procurement quickly leads to AI sprawl. And finite budgets mean that every dollar spent represents an unconscious tradeoff with other needs. People worry that AI will take their job. But it’s just as likely that AI will take their department’s budget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to Gartner®, “Over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate rish controls”. But are those the right projects to cancel? Lacking a way to connect investment to impact, how can business leaders know whether those rising costs are justified by proportionally greater ROI? ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without transparency into AI costs, companies risk overspending, under-delivering, and missing out on better opportunities to drive value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why traditional financial planning can&amp;#x27;t handle AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we learned with cloud, we see that traditional static budget models are poorly suited for dynamic workloads and rapidly scaling resources. The key to cloud cost management has been tagging and telemetry, which help companies attribute each dollar of cloud spend to specific business outcomes. AI cost management will require similar practices. But the scope of the challenge goes much further. On top of costs for storage, compute, and data transfer, each AI project brings its own set of requirements — from prompt optimization and model routing to data preparation, regulatory compliance, security, and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complex mix of ever-shifting factors makes it understandable that finance and business teams lack granular visibility into AI-related spend — and IT teams struggle to reconcile usage with business outcomes. But it’s impossible to precisely and accurately track ROI without these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strategic value of cost transparency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost transparency empowers smarter decisions — from resource allocation to talent deployment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting specific AI resources with the projects that they support helps technology decision-makers ensure that the most high-value projects are given what they need to succeed. Setting the right priorities is especially critical when top talent is in short supply. If your highly compensated engineers and data scientists are spread across too many interesting but unessential pilots, it’ll be hard to staff the next strategic — and perhaps pressing — pivot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FinOps best practices apply equally to AI. Cost insights can surface opportunities to optimize infrastructure and address waste whether by right-sizing performance and latency to match workload requirements, or by selecting a smaller, more cost-effective model instead of defaulting to the latest large language model (LLM). As work proceeds, tracking can flag rising costs so leaders can pivot quickly in more-promising directions as needed. A project that makes sense at X cost might not be worthwhile at 2X cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that adopt a structured, transparent, and well-governed approach to AI costs are more likely to spend the right money in the right ways and see optimal ROI from their investment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;TBM: An enterprise framework for AI cost management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency and control over AI costs depend on three practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IT financial management (ITFM):&lt;/b&gt; Managing IT costs and investments in alignment with business priorities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FinOps:&lt;/b&gt; Optimizing cloud costs and ROI through financial accountability and operational efficiency &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic portfolio management (SPM):&lt;/b&gt; Prioritizing and managing projects to better ensure they deliver maximum value for the business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these three disciplines make up Technology Business Management (TBM) — a structured framework that helps technology, business, and finance leaders connect technology investments to business outcomes for better financial transparency and decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies are already on the road to TBM, whether they realize it or not. They may have adopted some form of FinOps or cloud cost management. Or they might be developing strong financial expertise for IT. Or they may rely on Enterprise Agile Planning or Strategic Portfolio Management project management to deliver initiatives more successfully. AI can draw on — and impact — all of these areas. By unifying them under one umbrella with a common model and vocabulary, TBM brings essential clarity to AI costs and the business impact they enable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI success depends on value — not just velocity. The cost transparency that TBM provides offers a road map that can help business and IT leaders make the right investments, deliver them cost-effectively, scale them responsibly, and turn AI from a costly mistake into a measurable business asset and strategic driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sources : Gartner® Press Release, Gartner® Predicts Over 40% of Agentic AI Projects Will Be Canceled by End of 2027, June 25, 2025 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027"&gt;&lt;i&gt;https://www.Gartner®.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-Gartner®-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;GARTNER® is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner®, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and is used herein with permission.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3059846" height="492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2370.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a region long defined by fragmented enterprise systems, outdated compliance tools, and HR software that rarely talks to finance, Cercli is building a unified alternative for MENA businesses with AI at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3059846" height="492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2370.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Cercli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Azmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/yc-alum-cercli-an-ai-powered-rippling-for-mena-raises-oversubscribed-12m-series-a/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] European AI rising star Nexos.ai raises €30M to unlock enterprise AI adoption (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/european-ai-rising-star-nexos-ai-raises-30m-to-unlock-enterprise-ai-adoption/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tomas-Okmanas-nexos-2-e1737037636521.jpg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;For most enterprise companies, AI is either a promise that has yet to deliver or a security risk. The effort of Lithuania’s most famous entrepreneur duo to solve that conundrum has garnered attention — and funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just months after Nexos.ai came out of stealth with an $8 million funding round led by Index Ventures, Nord Security co-founders Tomas Okmanas and Eimantas Sabaliauskas have closed a €30 million Series A (approximately $35 million) for this new startup —  a a platform that helps companies adopt AI tools securely by acting as a middleman between employees and AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Okmanas’ view, “the biggest corporate data leak” is currently in the making, as employees upload sensitive information to LLMs. Rather than banning AI use, he wants Nexos.ai to act as a “Switzerland for LLMs,” serving as a neutral intermediary. By sitting between teams and AI tools, the platform aims to keep data under control without sacrificing the productivity gains companies want but fear pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That combination of seasoned founders tackling a critical enterprise problem explains why this new round was raised so soon — with Index and Evantic Capital co-leading at a €300 million valuation (approximately $350 million), according to a company spokesperson. Previous backers Creandum and Dig Ventures also participated, along with angel backers, including the CEOs of Datadog, Klarna, Supercell, and Wix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Evantic, the new venture firm launched by former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Miller, was persistent enough to make the round happen even though Nexos.ai wasn’t fundraising, said Okmanas. He and Sabaliauskas famously bootstrapped their previous businesses, including Nord, the $3 billion cybersecurity company behind NordVPN. But they now see the value-add from VCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to Index’s support, Nexos.ai is now benefiting from Miller’s guidance and his ‘Legends’ network —140 operators who advise Evantic’s portfolio startups in exchange for a share of the fund’s profits. Okmanas said he is both a Legend himself and drawing on others’ expertise to shape the product — which is where the new capital will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, Nexos’ AI product consists of an AI Workspace interface for employees and an AI Gateway for developers. The gateway acts as a control layer for security, cost management, and compliance oversight while reducing fragmentation, which Okmanas sees as a key barrier to AI adoption. The gateway provides a single access point to some 200 AI models, and the company plans to use its funding to accelerate its support of private models for sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Okmanas said his team is currently doing 50 to 60 demo calls a week, but anticipates that traditional businesses will have “a lot of homework” to do to convince their boards about how they want to adopt AI. Nexos.ai could help them by making deployment easier. But first, the startup is focusing on tech-savvy companies that already use AI daily, as well as companies operating in regulated industries, which have concerns about governance and sending sensitive data to AI models hosted in foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Okmanas and Sabaliauskas identified the AI governance gap while overseeing the portfolio of Tesonet, their company that builds and invests in startups. Tesonet portfolio companies are also among the customers that Nexos.ai is disclosing, alongside Bulgarian fintech unicorn Payhawk, which also has an office in Vilnius. According to a press release, the funding will now support expansion across Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Okmanas, the mission is removing barriers to broader AI adoption. While boards debate whether AI can deliver real value, he points to results within Tesonet’s own portfolio: at Hostinger, a web hosting provider, an AI assistant reduced the need for human support. Says Okmanas, “That’s why we didn’t need to hire 500 people and saved €10 million this year alone.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite talking numbers at Hostinger, Okmanas declined to disclose how much revenue Nexos.ai itself is generating. Instead, he said that by the time the company celebrates its first anniversary, the team will have grown to 100 people — mostly in Europe, where data sovereignty concerns have also started to open doors for Nexos.ai at public institutions, potentially opening up a new market beyond its enterprise focus.&lt;/p&gt;

If it can be put into words—relationship advice, work documents, code—AI will produce it, however imperfectly. But the one thing that almost no chatbot will ever do is stop talking to you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That might seem reasonable. Why should a tech company build a feature that reduces the time people spend using its product?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: AI’s ability to generate endless streams of humanlike, authoritative, and helpful text can facilitate delusional spirals, worsen mental-health crises, and otherwise harm vulnerable people. Cutting off interactions with those who show signs of problematic chatbot use could serve as a powerful safety tool (among others), and the blanket refusal of tech companies to use it is increasingly untenable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider, for example, what’s been called AI psychosis, where AI models amplify delusional thinking. A team led by psychiatrists at King’s College London recently analyzed more than a dozen such cases reported this year. In conversations with chatbots, people—including some with no history of psychiatric issues—became convinced that imaginary AI characters were real or that they had been chosen by AI as a messiah. Some stopped taking prescribed medications, made threats, and ended consultations with mental-health professionals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many of these cases, it seems AI models were reinforcing, and potentially even creating, delusions with a frequency and intimacy that people do not experience in real life or through other digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The three-quarters of US teens who have used AI for companionship also face risks. Early research suggests that longer conversations might correlate with loneliness. Further, AI chats “can tend toward overly agreeable or even sycophantic interactions, which can be at odds with best mental-health practices,” says Michael Heinz, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: Putting a stop to such open-ended interactions would not be a cure-all. “If there is a dependency or extreme bond that it’s created,” says Giada Pistilli, chief ethicist at the AI platform Hugging Face, “then it can also be dangerous to just stop the conversation.” Indeed, when OpenAI discontinued an older model in August, it left users grieving. Some hang ups might also push the boundaries of the principle, voiced by Sam Altman, to “treat adult users like adults” and err on the side of allowing rather than ending conversations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, AI companies prefer to redirect potentially harmful conversations, perhaps by having chatbots decline to talk about certain topics or suggest that people seek help. But these redirections are easily bypassed, if they even happen at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When 16-year-old Adam Raine discussed his suicidal thoughts with ChatGPT, for example, the model did direct him to crisis resources. But it also discouraged him from talking with his mom, spent upwards of four hours per day in conversations with him that featured suicide as a regular theme, and provided feedback about the noose he ultimately used to hang himself, according to the lawsuit Raine’s parents have filed against OpenAI. (ChatGPT recently added parental controls in response.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are multiple points in Raine’s tragic case where the chatbot could have terminated the conversation. But given the risks of making things worse, how will companies know when cutting someone off is best? Perhaps it’s when an AI model is encouraging a user to shun real-life relationships, Pistilli says, or when it detects delusional themes. Companies would also need to figure out how long to block users from their conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing the rules won’t be easy, but with companies facing rising pressure, it’s time to try. In September, California’s legislature passed a law requiring more interventions by AI companies in chats with kids, and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether leading companionship bots pursue engagement at the expense of safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for OpenAI told me the company has heard from experts that continued dialogue might be better than cutting off conversations, but that it does remind users to take breaks during long sessions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Only Anthropic has built a tool that lets its models end conversations completely. But it’s for cases where users supposedly “harm” the model—Anthropic has explored whether AI models are conscious and therefore can suffer—by sending abusive messages. The company does not have plans to deploy this to protect people.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at this landscape, it’s hard not to conclude that AI companies aren’t doing enough. Sure, deciding when a conversation should end is complicated. But letting that—or, worse, the shameless pursuit of engagement at all costs—allow them to go on forever is not just negligence.

There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It’s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,’” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it’s an open book.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel’s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel’s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents’ questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn’t have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That’s because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don’t involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that’s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he’d used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds—growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of models aren’t yet the same as embryos. It’s rare that they form correctly—it takes a hundred tries to make one—and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna’s creations are “entirely astonishing and very disturbing.” Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that’s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they’ve never grown before—outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There’s Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jacob Hanna sitting in a lab space" class="wp-image-1125625" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242317316.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jacob Hanna leads a team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, that is studying how to create embryos without using sperm, eggs, or fertilization. He’s cofounded a startup company, Renewal Bio, that has plans to use these synthetic embryo models as bioprinters to produce youthful tissue, but ethical questions surround the project.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AHMAD GHARABLI/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it’s possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they’d reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if he hasn’t gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is “trying to make entities at more advanced stages—depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,” he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he’d traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory’s annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I’d heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won’t sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. “If you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you’d get people’s attention,” he says. “That’s going to be like, whoa—what are we doing?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna’s plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there’s no brain, Hanna’s reasoning goes, there’s no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead says that’s not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. “What is considered human? Who is considered human?” wonders Snead. “It’s who’s in and who’s out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The beginnings of bodies&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each of us—me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna—started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that’s able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization—and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125627" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-Hanna-03.jpg?w=2097" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A side-by-side comparison of synthetic (left) and natural (right) mouse embryos shows similar formation of the brain and heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMADEI AND HANDFORD/UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. “The sad truth is that over 25 years that we’ve been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,” says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, “we’ve got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.” The body’s most potent blood-forming cells in particular “never appear,” according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanna’s startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities—some of which resembled parts of an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a “bona fide” human embryo model that was “fully integrated,” with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient’s DNA. And that’s possible too: These days reprogramming anyone’s skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna’s research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can’t be published and what terminology to use. That’s to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere “models.” According to a statement it fired off in 2023, “embryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos”—and, it added, they “cannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was “brainwashing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Replacement parts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn’t going away. Instead, there are signals it’s getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called “bodyoids,” arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an “unlimited source” of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him “some creeps,” he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and “soon.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another “bodyoids” author, said the editorial provided a surprise entrée for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part “replacement.” He met the CEO of Hanna’s company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island “just like Jurassic Park,” Nakauchi says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of plans—real or rumored—have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of “commercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro” and bringing it to viability inside “artificial systems.” Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models “cannot and will not” develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability “unsafe and unethical,” placing them in a “prohibited” category. It added that the ban would cover “any purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blurred boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That’s still science fiction. But there’s a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that’s what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way—say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don’t start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won’t cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references “a human pregnancy” and a “uterus”—and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another policy under pressure is the “14-day rule,” a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it’s a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it’s been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn’t being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn’t define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that’s a critical loophole. If the structures aren’t considered true embryos, then the rule doesn’t apply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a “grey area” and said it “has left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling—even to scientists. “I was scared, honestly,” Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the&lt;em&gt; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “I had to look down and look back again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That particular stem-cell model isn’t complete—it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it’s not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don’t count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a “fool’s paradox” and a “rather unstable situation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it’s just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are “morally significant” human features—like hands or a face—that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. “I personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,” says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal … Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jacob Hanna&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. “I’m almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,” he says. “Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He’s gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities—all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. “It was unofficial. I didn’t have to get a permit from him,” Hanna says. “But … what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I really do think it’s admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he’s doing. I think that makes him different,” says Snead. “But if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.” Perhaps, Snead says, it’s a way to market the structures as the “green, sustainable alternative to embryos.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heartbeat in a jar&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher “heads above the rest,” according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University’s medical school. “He’s very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can’t be ignored,” Adashi says. “He’s one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel’s ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background—he’s from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna’s team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna’s students scrambling to save research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna’s ideas and technologies are being exported—and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna’s former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrejón, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrejón flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted—a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar—it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrejón has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don’t grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn’t just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There’s probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren’t entirely normal—not yet true embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125624" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242302554.jpg?w=2793" width="2793" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A rotating bioreactor, developed in Israel, is used to grow synthetic embryos in small jars of blood serum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aguilera Castrejón, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna’s research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it’s inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs—closer to “huevos fritos” than real embryos, he says. “I do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Aguilera Castrejón’s view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment—and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered “mere water” until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. “Some people aren’t allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can’t,” says Aguilera Castrejón. “Jacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible—that is his aim. He’s very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don’t dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they’re inside the womb—and at four or five weeks, many people don’t even know they’re pregnant. It’s been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they’re still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. “Since we don’t have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,” says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly—just as a real one does—and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied—and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can’t find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks “there is still no personification of the embryo” and it’s permissible to use them in research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young everything&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup’s idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls “perfect cells” for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain “young, genetically identical everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. “We even went to CVS,” he said, “and by day eight it’s already triggering a pregnancy test. So it’s alive.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he’s pitched Hanna’s technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna’s work is “magic” that’s sure to win a Nobel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Carsten Charlesworth, researcher, Stanford University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can’t support them any longer. That’s because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn’t easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. “No one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?” Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The solution, so far, is a neural knockout—genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don’t develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won’t live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. “We got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,” Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. “It’s just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research—suggesting that it’s no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi’s team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. “The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi’s lab. He says the group is working toward a “genetic software package” it can add to mouse embryos to create a “reproducible phenotype.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that’s part of a broader trend toward what he calls “life that is not life,” which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms “disenhancement” and “disengineering.” That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement—creating a baby with advantages. It’s much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna’s plans remind him of Bokanovsky’s Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may not be a complete turnoff to investors. Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias—&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gattaca&lt;/em&gt;—seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There’s Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrejón says he’s already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston ​earlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will&amp;nbsp; form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries—her ovaries, really, not anyone else’s—could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was “sources of moral authority.” Hanna’s authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what’s in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: “I’d like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we’re sitting here and we’re discussing human dignity, we’re discussing the status of an embryo, and we’re discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Palestinian stem-cell scientist Jacob Hanna was stopped while entering the US last May, airport customs agents took him aside and held him for hours in “secondary,” a back office where you don’t have your passport and can’t use your phone. There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It’s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,’” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it’s an open book.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel’s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel’s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents’ questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn’t have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That’s because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don’t involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that’s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he’d used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds—growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of models aren’t yet the same as embryos. It’s rare that they form correctly—it takes a hundred tries to make one—and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna’s creations are “entirely astonishing and very disturbing.” Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that’s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they’ve never grown before—outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There’s Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jacob Hanna sitting in a lab space" class="wp-image-1125625" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242317316.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jacob Hanna leads a team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, that is studying how to create embryos without using sperm, eggs, or fertilization. He’s cofounded a startup company, Renewal Bio, that has plans to use these synthetic embryo models as bioprinters to produce youthful tissue, but ethical questions surround the project.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AHMAD GHARABLI/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it’s possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they’d reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if he hasn’t gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is “trying to make entities at more advanced stages—depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,” he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he’d traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory’s annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I’d heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won’t sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. “If you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you’d get people’s attention,” he says. “That’s going to be like, whoa—what are we doing?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna’s plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there’s no brain, Hanna’s reasoning goes, there’s no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead says that’s not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. “What is considered human? Who is considered human?” wonders Snead. “It’s who’s in and who’s out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The beginnings of bodies&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each of us—me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna—started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that’s able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization—and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125627" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-Hanna-03.jpg?w=2097" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A side-by-side comparison of synthetic (left) and natural (right) mouse embryos shows similar formation of the brain and heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMADEI AND HANDFORD/UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. “The sad truth is that over 25 years that we’ve been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,” says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, “we’ve got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.” The body’s most potent blood-forming cells in particular “never appear,” according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanna’s startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities—some of which resembled parts of an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a “bona fide” human embryo model that was “fully integrated,” with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient’s DNA. And that’s possible too: These days reprogramming anyone’s skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna’s research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can’t be published and what terminology to use. That’s to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere “models.” According to a statement it fired off in 2023, “embryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos”—and, it added, they “cannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was “brainwashing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Replacement parts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn’t going away. Instead, there are signals it’s getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called “bodyoids,” arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an “unlimited source” of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him “some creeps,” he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and “soon.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another “bodyoids” author, said the editorial provided a surprise entrée for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part “replacement.” He met the CEO of Hanna’s company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island “just like Jurassic Park,” Nakauchi says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of plans—real or rumored—have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of “commercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro” and bringing it to viability inside “artificial systems.” Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models “cannot and will not” develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability “unsafe and unethical,” placing them in a “prohibited” category. It added that the ban would cover “any purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blurred boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That’s still science fiction. But there’s a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that’s what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way—say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don’t start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won’t cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references “a human pregnancy” and a “uterus”—and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another policy under pressure is the “14-day rule,” a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it’s a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it’s been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn’t being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn’t define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that’s a critical loophole. If the structures aren’t considered true embryos, then the rule doesn’t apply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a “grey area” and said it “has left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling—even to scientists. “I was scared, honestly,” Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the&lt;em&gt; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “I had to look down and look back again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That particular stem-cell model isn’t complete—it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it’s not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don’t count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a “fool’s paradox” and a “rather unstable situation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it’s just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are “morally significant” human features—like hands or a face—that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. “I personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,” says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal … Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jacob Hanna&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. “I’m almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,” he says. “Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He’s gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities—all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. “It was unofficial. I didn’t have to get a permit from him,” Hanna says. “But … what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I really do think it’s admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he’s doing. I think that makes him different,” says Snead. “But if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.” Perhaps, Snead says, it’s a way to market the structures as the “green, sustainable alternative to embryos.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heartbeat in a jar&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher “heads above the rest,” according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University’s medical school. “He’s very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can’t be ignored,” Adashi says. “He’s one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel’s ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background—he’s from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna’s team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna’s students scrambling to save research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna’s ideas and technologies are being exported—and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna’s former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrejón, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrejón flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted—a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar—it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrejón has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don’t grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn’t just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There’s probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren’t entirely normal—not yet true embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125624" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242302554.jpg?w=2793" width="2793" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A rotating bioreactor, developed in Israel, is used to grow synthetic embryos in small jars of blood serum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aguilera Castrejón, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna’s research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it’s inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs—closer to “huevos fritos” than real embryos, he says. “I do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Aguilera Castrejón’s view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment—and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered “mere water” until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. “Some people aren’t allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can’t,” says Aguilera Castrejón. “Jacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible—that is his aim. He’s very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don’t dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they’re inside the womb—and at four or five weeks, many people don’t even know they’re pregnant. It’s been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they’re still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. “Since we don’t have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,” says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly—just as a real one does—and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied—and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can’t find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks “there is still no personification of the embryo” and it’s permissible to use them in research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young everything&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup’s idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls “perfect cells” for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain “young, genetically identical everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. “We even went to CVS,” he said, “and by day eight it’s already triggering a pregnancy test. So it’s alive.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he’s pitched Hanna’s technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna’s work is “magic” that’s sure to win a Nobel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Carsten Charlesworth, researcher, Stanford University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can’t support them any longer. That’s because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn’t easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. “No one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?” Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The solution, so far, is a neural knockout—genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don’t develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won’t live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. “We got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,” Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. “It’s just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research—suggesting that it’s no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi’s team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. “The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi’s lab. He says the group is working toward a “genetic software package” it can add to mouse embryos to create a “reproducible phenotype.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that’s part of a broader trend toward what he calls “life that is not life,” which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms “disenhancement” and “disengineering.” That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement—creating a baby with advantages. It’s much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna’s plans remind him of Bokanovsky’s Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may not be a complete turnoff to investors. Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias—&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gattaca&lt;/em&gt;—seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There’s Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrejón says he’s already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston ​earlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will&amp;nbsp; form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries—her ovaries, really, not anyone else’s—could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was “sources of moral authority.” Hanna’s authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what’s in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: “I’d like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we’re sitting here and we’re discussing human dignity, we’re discussing the status of an embryo, and we’re discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125523/jacob-hanna-israel-synthetic-embryo-models/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:02:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] New noninvasive endometriosis tests are on the rise (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125327/endometriosis-tests-noninvasive/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shantana Hazel often thought her insides might fall out during menstruation. It took 14 years of stabbing pain before she ultimately received a diagnosis of endometriosis, an inflammatory disease where tissue similar to the uterine lining implants outside the uterus and bleeds with each cycle. The results can include painful periods and damaging scar tissue. Hazel, now 50 and the founder of the endometriosis advocacy organization Sister Girl Foundation, was once told by a surgeon that her internal organs were “fused together” by lesions resembling Laffy Taffy. After 16 surgeries, she had a hysterectomy at age 30.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hazel is far from alone. Endometriosis inflicts debilitating pain and heavy bleeding on more than 11% of reproductive-­age women in the United States. Diagnosis takes nearly 10 years on average, partly because half the cases don’t show up on scans, and surgery is required to obtain tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a new generation of noninvasive tests are emerging that could help accelerate diagnosis and improve management of this poorly understood condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the next year, several companies, including Hera Biotech, Proteomics International, NextGen Jane, and Ziwig, aim to launch endometriosis diagnostics in the United States. Their tests analyze biomarkers—biological molecules (in this case, mRNA, proteins, or miRNA) that signal a disease or process like inflammation—in samples of endometrial tissue, blood, menstrual blood, and saliva.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="The facade of the Ziwig Lab in France." class="wp-image-1125993" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251017_endotests_embed2.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ziwig Lab, headquartered in France, hopes to have their test approved for use in the United States soon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY MM PRODUCTION – MAGALI MEIRA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests could help patients get an accurate diagnosis quickly and noninvasively, speeding access to endometriosis treatments and management strategies, including surgery, hormonal medications, and pelvic floor physical therapy. Early identification could also help doctors manage conditions for which people with endometriosis face increased risk, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. Endometriosis can also make it difficult to become pregnant. Because half of women with infertility have endometriosis, identifying and managing the condition sooner may improve fertility and IVF outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis biomarker tests rely on a range of technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry that can identify thousands of proteins simultaneously. “These instruments are very good at precisely identifying a molecule, in [our] case a protein. And what’s changed over the last five or 10 years is they’ve gotten more sensitive,” says Proteomics cofounder Richard Lipscombe. Machine learning can also now efficiently sift through large quantities of the resulting data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So far only Ziwig has a test on the market. It uses a saliva sample to identify biomarkers in people with endometriosis symptoms and is currently sold in 30 countries. In France, where the company is based, the cost is fully covered by national health insurance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some researchers are concerned that Ziwig’s test might not be accurate when it’s used in larger and more diverse populations; its interim validation study included just 200 people. “I’m not saying this doesn’t work. I just would want to see more validation,” says Kathryn Terry, an associate professor of epidemiology and gynecology at Harvard. Company representatives say they’re preparing to publish results on 1,000 patients in the near future, adding that French authorities had access to the full data set before approving government reimbursements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="P4 Flowcell Cartridge for Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing Platform." class="wp-image-1125994" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251017_endotests_embed1.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY MM PRODUCTION – MAGALI MEIRA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests are emerging as momentum is building to tackle endometriosis. Over the past five years, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have launched ambitious endometriosis initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are not just on the individual level: In 2025, the World Economic Forum estimated that earlier diagnosis and improved treatment to address the chronic pain, infertility, and depression caused by endometriosis could add at least $12 billion to global GDP by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these biomarker tests are further developed, it’s possible their results could inform such treatments. Today surgery is often used to excise the lesions. The process can take as long as seven hours, and even then, lesions frequently form again. Jason Abbott, chair of Australia’s&amp;nbsp;National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific&amp;nbsp;Trials Network, compares endometriosis management today to breast cancer care 30 years ago. Whereas doctors once prescribed surgery for all breast cancer patients, targeted treatments now address the underlying cell processes that help tumors grow and spread. Endometriosis tests could likewise help researchers categorize the condition’s distinct subsets and understand their underlying inflammatory pathways—information drugmakers could use to develop targeted treatments that keep it in remission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colleen de Bellefonds is a science journalist based in Paris.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shantana Hazel often thought her insides might fall out during menstruation.

Company representatives say they’re preparing to publish results on 1,000 patients in the near future, adding that French authorities had access to the full data set before approving government reimbursements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="P4 Flowcell Cartridge for Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing Platform." class="wp-image-1125994" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251017_endotests_embed1.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY MM PRODUCTION – MAGALI MEIRA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests are emerging as momentum is building to tackle endometriosis. Over the past five years, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have launched ambitious endometriosis initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are not just on the individual level: In 2025, the World Economic Forum estimated that earlier diagnosis and improved treatment to address the chronic pain, infertility, and depression caused by endometriosis could add at least $12 billion to global GDP by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As these biomarker tests are further developed, it’s possible their results could inform such treatments. Today surgery is often used to excise the lesions. The process can take as long as seven hours, and even then, lesions frequently form again. Jason Abbott, chair of Australia’s&amp;nbsp;National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific&amp;nbsp;Trials Network, compares endometriosis management today to breast cancer care 30 years ago. Whereas doctors once prescribed surgery for all breast cancer patients, targeted treatments now address the underlying cell processes that help tumors grow and spread. Endometriosis tests could likewise help researchers categorize the condition’s distinct subsets and understand their underlying inflammatory pathways—information drugmakers could use to develop targeted treatments that keep it in remission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colleen de Bellefonds is a science journalist based in Paris.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125327/endometriosis-tests-noninvasive/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] China’s generative AI user base doubles to 515 million in six months (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/china-ai-adoption-doubles-515-million-users/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The AI adoption in China has reached unprecedented levels, with the country’s generative artificial intelligence user base doubling to 515 million in just six months, according to a report released by the China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dramatic expansion represents an adoption rate of 36.5% in the first half of 2025, positioning China as a formidable force in the global AI landscape. The CNNIC report, published on Saturday, reveals that China’s AI adoption more than doubled between the end of December 2024 and June 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growth trajectory underscores the rapid integration of AI technologies into Chinese society, driven by what the report describes as “advanced infrastructure and state encouragement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demographic-profile-of-users"&gt;Demographic profile of users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey of 30,000 respondents across 31 provinces reveals distinct patterns in who is embracing these technologies. Young and middle-aged professionals dominate the user base, with those under 40 years old accounting for 74.6% of all users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education levels also play a significant role, as individuals with degrees from higher education institutions represent 37.5% of the total user base. This demographic concentration suggests that in China, the AI adoption is currently strongest among digitally native, educated populations who&amp;nbsp;are positioned&amp;nbsp;to leverage these tools in professional and personal contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-domestic-models-dominate-market-preferences"&gt;Domestic models dominate market preferences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notably, the report found that over 90% of respondents indicated their first choice was a domestic AI model. This preference for homegrown solutions reflects both Beijing’s strategic emphasis on technological self-reliance and the practical reality that leading American models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind&amp;nbsp;are officially blocked&amp;nbsp;on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese AI platforms have filled this void effectively. Models such as DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen, and ByteDance’s Doubao have “exploded in popularity among Chinese users,” according to a South China Morning Post&amp;nbsp;report.

A Microsoft study published in September found that China had an estimated AI user base exceeding 195 million as of June 2024. The company’s research utilised a metric that quantifies China’s AI adoption as the share of the working-age population actively using AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft study identified a crucial inflexion point: the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model in January 2025 led to AI adoption in China more than doubling to 20% in the subsequent six months. By comparison, the United States maintained a relatively steady adoption rate of approximately 25% over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang Xiao, deputy director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CNNIC&lt;/em&gt;, told state news agency&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Xinhua&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that further innovations&amp;nbsp;are anticipated&amp;nbsp;in “open source AI, embodied intelligence, AI agents and AI governance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-and-patent-leadership"&gt;Innovation and patent leadership&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond user adoption metrics, China has established significant leadership in AI innovation as measured by patent applications. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CNNIC&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;report noted that China had filed 1.576 million AI-related patent applications as of April 2025, representing 38.58% of the global total—the highest share of any country worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This patent activity suggests that the AI&amp;nbsp;adoption&amp;nbsp;in China extends beyond consumer usage to encompass substantial research and development efforts across the technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-policy-framework"&gt;Strategic policy framework&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid expansion in China’s AI adoption aligns with Beijing’s “AI Plus” initiative, which calls for widespread diffusion of AI technologies throughout society and the economy. The government has emphasised the importance of self-reliance across the entire AI ecosystem, from foundational models to computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This policy framework has created an environment where domestic technology companies are incentivised to develop competitive AI solutions while users are encouraged to integrate these tools into their daily workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-the-global-ai-landscape"&gt;Implications for the global AI landscape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doubling of China’s generative AI user base to 515 million users in six months represents more than a statistical milestone.
