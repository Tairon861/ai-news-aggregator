The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unlimited Bio’s muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genes for life&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the VEGF therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other researchers aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limited bio&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.&amp;nbsp; “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A penis project&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be &lt;em&gt;safer or more effective&lt;/em&gt; than existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_muscle-gene-therapy-hero_3fff36.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial.

It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:55:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s what brought Octavia Carbon here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="large pipes run along the ground with the buildings of the Climeworks' Mammoth plant in the distance" class="wp-image-1126480" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2154475415.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Climeworks’ Mammoth carbon removal plant near Reykjavik, Iceland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JOHN MOORE/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130194" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/h_15989125.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Maasai men walk along the road beside the Olkaria geothermal plant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;REDUX PICTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Challenging the power dynamic&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate &lt;em&gt;solutions&lt;/em&gt;. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130185" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bilha_Portrait.jpg?w=1667" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF BILHA NDIRANGU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="drone view of shipping container buildings next to a solar array" class="wp-image-1130188" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pilot-Plant-2_Sirona.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cella and Sirona Technologies have a pilot program in the Great Rift Valley called Project Jacaranda.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SIRONA TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The chance to solve a “real-world issue”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130187" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/M_Ng-01712.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In June, Octavia started testing its technology in the field in a pilot project in Gilgil.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130201" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1h_Octavia.jpg?w=2632" width="2632" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Octavia relies on an amine absorption method similar to the one used by other DAC plants around the world, but its project stands apart—having been tailored to suit the local climate and run on more than 80% thermal energy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Once the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130186" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/M_Ng-01708-1.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The modular design of Octavia's device can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once demand is there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An uphill climb&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130195" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JMTEHK.jpg?w=2997" width="2997" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In pitching the Great Carbon Valley, Ndirangu has played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there's no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130175" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/martincic-greatcarbonvalley-square.jpg?w=1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MIRIAM MARTINCIC&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Back to the land&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130193" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BE8JR4.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Maasai people have inhabited swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, for centuries, though many still lack access to the power that’s now produced there.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diana Kruzman is a freelance journalist covering environmental and human rights issues around the world.

Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s what brought Octavia Carbon here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="large pipes run along the ground with the buildings of the Climeworks' Mammoth plant in the distance" class="wp-image-1126480" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2154475415.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Climeworks’ Mammoth carbon removal plant near Reykjavik, Iceland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JOHN MOORE/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130194" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/h_15989125.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Maasai men walk along the road beside the Olkaria geothermal plant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;REDUX PICTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Challenging the power dynamic&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate &lt;em&gt;solutions&lt;/em&gt;. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130185" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bilha_Portrait.jpg?w=1667" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF BILHA NDIRANGU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="drone view of shipping container buildings next to a solar array" class="wp-image-1130188" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pilot-Plant-2_Sirona.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cella and Sirona Technologies have a pilot program in the Great Rift Valley called Project Jacaranda.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SIRONA TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The chance to solve a “real-world issue”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130187" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/M_Ng-01712.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In June, Octavia started testing its technology in the field in a pilot project in Gilgil.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130201" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1h_Octavia.jpg?w=2632" width="2632" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Octavia relies on an amine absorption method similar to the one used by other DAC plants around the world, but its project stands apart—having been tailored to suit the local climate and run on more than 80% thermal energy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Once the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130186" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/M_Ng-01708-1.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The modular design of Octavia's device can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once demand is there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OCTAVIA CARBON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An uphill climb&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130195" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JMTEHK.jpg?w=2997" width="2997" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In pitching the Great Carbon Valley, Ndirangu has played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there's no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130175" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/martincic-greatcarbonvalley-square.jpg?w=1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MIRIAM MARTINCIC&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Back to the land&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_32"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1130193" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BE8JR4.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Maasai people have inhabited swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, for centuries, though many still lack access to the power that’s now produced there.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diana Kruzman is a freelance journalist covering environmental and human rights issues around the world.

A new three-year AI partnership by Tesco points to how one of the UK’s biggest supermarket groups is trying to achieve just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesco plans to work with Mistral to develop AI tools that can be used in its business, from internal workflows to customer-facing systems. The aim, according to the retailer, is to save staff time, improve how teams work, and strengthen customer service. Ruben Lara Hernandez, Tesco’s Data, analytics &amp;amp; AI director, said the partnership brings together Tesco’s retail experience with Mistral’s technology, with the hope that it will help colleagues work more efficiently and support customers more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tesco moves AI into day-to-day retail operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s focus reflects a wider shift in how enterprises are using AI. Early retail experiments often centred on customer-facing tools that were easy to see but hard to scale. More recent efforts are aimed at internal use, where AI can reduce repetitive work, support planning, and help staff make decisions faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, the retailer has doubled the size of its technology team, signalling that software and data are now core to how the business operates. AI is already used in several parts of the organisation, in in-house development and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In online grocery, AI helps find more efficient delivery routes, which can open up additional delivery slots for customers. In supply planning, AI supports demand forecasting, helping stores maintain product availability. The company also uses AI to personalise how it engages with customers through its Clubcard loyalty scheme, tailoring offers and communications based on shopping behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Mistral is meant to build on this existing work. One factor behind the collaboration is Mistral’s approach to model deployment, which allows AI systems to run in more controlled environments. For a retailer handling large volumes of customer and operational data, that level of control matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistral’s chief revenue officer and US general manager, Marjorie Janiewicz, said the company’s Applied AI team will work closely with Tesco’s internal experts. She described the goal as building AI products that are customisable and controllable, with a focus on improving internal workflows and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A long-term partnership, not a one-off project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure of the partnership also suggests a cautious approach to scale. Tesco plans to create an internal AI lab as part of the agreement, giving teams space to test and refine tools before wider deployment. For large organisations, this kind of setup can help prevent AI projects from remaining stuck in isolated pilots or specialist teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a strategic angle to the choice of partner. Mistral AI is the only European company developing large language models, and Tesco is the first major UK retailer to form a partnership with the startup as part of its broader AI and technology plans. Founded in April 2023, Mistral has grown quickly and counts enterprises like HSBC, AXA, and Stellantis among its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Tesco, the harder work now lies in execution. Retail data is often fragmented in regions, systems, and channels, and AI systems depend on that data being accurate and consistent. Rolling tools out in a business of this size also requires training, oversight, and trust from staff who use them daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the partnership succeeds will likely depend on how visible its impact becomes inside the organisation. If AI tools help store teams, planners, and analysts work more smoothly, the gains may be gradual rather than dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As retailers look to move beyond experimentation, Tesco’s approach offers a view of how enterprise AI is starting to settle into routine operations – not as a single solution, but as a steady process of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Shashank Verma)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Zara’s use of AI shows how retail workflows are quietly changing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek, all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington, pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Most recently though, headlines around OpenAI have focused on its competition gaining ground, with CEO Sam Altman’s “code red” internal memo shifting company focus toward its flagship chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And going further into the archives for context, this year came after a packed 2024, from OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-lets-users-tweak-chatgpt-s-energy-and-tone"&gt;OpenAI lets users tweak ChatGPT’s energy and tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new controls in ChatGPT that let users adjust the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, emoji use, and formatting style. This builds on existing tone options, addressing past complaints about the AI being too sycophantic or cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-updates-chatgpt-guidelines-to-protect-teen-users"&gt;OpenAI updates ChatGPT guidelines to protect teen users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its guidelines for users under 18 and released new resources for parents to promote safer interactions with ChatGPT. Experts caution that while the rules are clearer on paper, it’s unclear how consistently the AI follows them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-3b-in-mobile-app-revenue-faster-than-tiktok"&gt;ChatGPT hits $3B in mobile app revenue faster than TikTok &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT has surpassed $3 billion in global consumer spending on mobile since its 2023 launch. This makes it one of the fastest-growing apps in terms of revenue, outpacing rivals like TikTok, Disney+, and HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-an-updated-image-generation-model"&gt;OpenAI rolls out an updated image generation model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT Image 1.5, a new version of ChatGPT Images that’s faster and better at following instructions and making precise edits. The update comes as OpenAI races to keep up with Google’s Gemini and Nano Banana Pro in AI image generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disney-gives-openai-a-one-year-exclusive-period-before-expanding-ai-licensing"&gt;Disney gives OpenAI a one-year exclusive period before expanding AI licensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney is putting $1 billion into OpenAI as a way to dive into AI, letting users on Sora create videos using over 200 Disney characters, at least for the first year exclusively. Bob Iger says the deal gives Disney a chance to explore AI while protecting its characters and figuring out how to use this technology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-highlights-enterprise-surge-as-google-pressure-grows"&gt;OpenAI highlights enterprise surge as Google pressure grows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says enterprise use of its AI tools has surged, with ChatGPT message volume up 8x since late 2024 and workers saving up to an hour a day. The data underscores OpenAI’s push to win enterprise customers as competition heats up from Google, Anthropic, and open-model rivals, a recurring theme you’ll see in recent updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-2-as-google-rivalry-heats-up"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5.2 as Google rivalry heats up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its latest model, GPT-5.2, as competition with Google continued to heat up.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disney-partners-with-openai-to-bring-its-characters-to-sora-ai-videos"&gt;Disney partners with OpenAI to bring its characters to Sora AI videos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney has signed a three-year deal with OpenAI, investing $1 billion and bringing characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to OpenAI’s Sora video generator. The partnership will let users create AI videos using hundreds of Disney-owned characters, costumes, and props. On the same day, Disney notably launched a lawsuit against Google alleging “massive” copyright infringement occurring in its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-calls-code-red-inside-openai-as-chatgpt-faces-rising-competition"&gt;Altman calls ‘code red’ inside OpenAI as ChatGPT faces rising competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has put OpenAI on “code red,” telling staff the company will prioritize improving ChatGPT as pressure mounts from Google and other AI competitors, according to The Information. As part of the move, OpenAI plans to put some other initiatives, including advertising, on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-2025"&gt;November 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-ai-assistant-for-online-shopping"&gt;OpenAI introduces AI assistant for online shopping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI shopping feature in ChatGPT ahead of the peak holiday shopping window to help users research potential purchases. OpenAI’s new ChatGPT shopping feature lets users get product recommendations by describing features or sharing photos to find similar items at different prices. And they’re not alone, with both Perplexity and a slew of competitor startups playing in the commerce space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-refutes-claims-linking-chatgpt-to-teen-s-death"&gt;OpenAI refutes claims linking ChatGPT to teen’s death&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After Adam Raine’s family sued OpenAI in August, claiming their teen used ChatGPT as a “suicide coach,” OpenAI said in a new court filing that it isn’t liable, arguing the chatbot was misused. This marks OpenAI’s first response to a case that has raised wider concerns about chatbots and mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-integrates-voice-mode-into-main-interface"&gt;ChatGPT integrates voice mode into main interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT’s voice mode straight into the main chat, so you no longer have to jump to a separate screen. Now you can talk to ChatGPT and see everything it says and shows right in the same window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-blocked-from-cameo-following-trademark-lawsuit"&gt;OpenAI blocked from ‘Cameo’ following trademark lawsuit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI can’t use “cameo” for Sora features for now, following a trademark lawsuit from the video app Cameo, with the ban lasting until December 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-group-chat-feature-now-available-to-all-chatgpt-users"&gt;Group chat feature now available to all ChatGPT users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is now getting group chats for everyone — Free, Go, Plus, and Pro users alike — after testing it in a few regions last week. You can now team up with friends, family, or co-workers in one chat with ChatGPT to plan, create, or make decisions together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-1-with-advanced-reasoning-and-user-friendly-tone"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT‑5.1 with advanced reasoning and user-friendly tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-munich-court-says-chatgpt-violated-music-copyright-laws"&gt;Munich court says ChatGPT violated music copyright laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-eyes-consumer-health-market-with-ai-powered-tools"&gt;OpenAI eyes consumer health market with AI-powered tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-more-families-accuse-openai-of-negligence-over-chatgpt-related-suicides"&gt;Seven more families accuse OpenAI of negligence over ChatGPT-related suicides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reaches-1-million-business-clients-in-record-time"&gt;OpenAI reaches 1 million business clients in record time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xai-claims-apple-s-app-store-practices-give-openai-an-unfair-advantage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI claims Apple’s App Store practices give OpenAI an unfair advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2191707579.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek, all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington, pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Most recently though, headlines around OpenAI have focused on its competition gaining ground, with CEO Sam Altman’s “code red” internal memo shifting company focus toward its flagship chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And going further into the archives for context, this year came after a packed 2024, from OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new controls in ChatGPT that let users adjust the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, emoji use, and formatting style. This builds on existing tone options, addressing past complaints about the AI being too sycophantic or cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-updates-chatgpt-guidelines-to-protect-teen-users"&gt;OpenAI updates ChatGPT guidelines to protect teen users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its guidelines for users under 18 and released new resources for parents to promote safer interactions with ChatGPT. Experts caution that while the rules are clearer on paper, it’s unclear how consistently the AI follows them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-3b-in-mobile-app-revenue-faster-than-tiktok"&gt;ChatGPT hits $3B in mobile app revenue faster than TikTok &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT has surpassed $3 billion in global consumer spending on mobile since its 2023 launch. This makes it one of the fastest-growing apps in terms of revenue, outpacing rivals like TikTok, Disney+, and HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-an-updated-image-generation-model"&gt;OpenAI rolls out an updated image generation model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT Image 1.5, a new version of ChatGPT Images that’s faster and better at following instructions and making precise edits. The update comes as OpenAI races to keep up with Google’s Gemini and Nano Banana Pro in AI image generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disney-gives-openai-a-one-year-exclusive-period-before-expanding-ai-licensing"&gt;Disney gives OpenAI a one-year exclusive period before expanding AI licensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney is putting $1 billion into OpenAI as a way to dive into AI, letting users on Sora create videos using over 200 Disney characters, at least for the first year exclusively. Bob Iger says the deal gives Disney a chance to explore AI while protecting its characters and figuring out how to use this technology in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-highlights-enterprise-surge-as-google-pressure-grows"&gt;OpenAI highlights enterprise surge as Google pressure grows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says enterprise use of its AI tools has surged, with ChatGPT message volume up 8x since late 2024 and workers saving up to an hour a day. The data underscores OpenAI’s push to win enterprise customers as competition heats up from Google, Anthropic, and open-model rivals, a recurring theme you’ll see in recent updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-2-as-google-rivalry-heats-up"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5.2 as Google rivalry heats up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its latest model, GPT-5.2, as competition with Google continued to heat up. The model will roll out to paid ChatGPT users and developers in three versions — Instant, Thinking, and Pro — tailored for everything from everyday tasks to complex reasoning and high-accuracy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disney-partners-with-openai-to-bring-its-characters-to-sora-ai-videos"&gt;Disney partners with OpenAI to bring its characters to Sora AI videos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney has signed a three-year deal with OpenAI, investing $1 billion and bringing characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to OpenAI’s Sora video generator. The partnership will let users create AI videos using hundreds of Disney-owned characters, costumes, and props. On the same day, Disney notably launched a lawsuit against Google alleging “massive” copyright infringement occurring in its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-calls-code-red-inside-openai-as-chatgpt-faces-rising-competition"&gt;Altman calls ‘code red’ inside OpenAI as ChatGPT faces rising competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has put OpenAI on “code red,” telling staff the company will prioritize improving ChatGPT as pressure mounts from Google and other AI competitors, according to The Information. As part of the move, OpenAI plans to put some other initiatives, including advertising, on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-2025"&gt;November 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-ai-assistant-for-online-shopping"&gt;OpenAI introduces AI assistant for online shopping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI shopping feature in ChatGPT ahead of the peak holiday shopping window to help users research potential purchases. OpenAI’s new ChatGPT shopping feature lets users get product recommendations by describing features or sharing photos to find similar items at different prices. And they’re not alone, with both Perplexity and a slew of competitor startups playing in the commerce space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-refutes-claims-linking-chatgpt-to-teen-s-death"&gt;OpenAI refutes claims linking ChatGPT to teen’s death&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After Adam Raine’s family sued OpenAI in August, claiming their teen used ChatGPT as a “suicide coach,” OpenAI said in a new court filing that it isn’t liable, arguing the chatbot was misused. This marks OpenAI’s first response to a case that has raised wider concerns about chatbots and mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-integrates-voice-mode-into-main-interface"&gt;ChatGPT integrates voice mode into main interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT’s voice mode straight into the main chat, so you no longer have to jump to a separate screen. Now you can talk to ChatGPT and see everything it says and shows right in the same window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-blocked-from-cameo-following-trademark-lawsuit"&gt;OpenAI blocked from ‘Cameo’ following trademark lawsuit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI can’t use “cameo” for Sora features for now, following a trademark lawsuit from the video app Cameo, with the ban lasting until December 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-group-chat-feature-now-available-to-all-chatgpt-users"&gt;Group chat feature now available to all ChatGPT users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is now getting group chats for everyone — Free, Go, Plus, and Pro users alike — after testing it in a few regions last week. You can now team up with friends, family, or co-workers in one chat with ChatGPT to plan, create, or make decisions together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-1-with-advanced-reasoning-and-user-friendly-tone"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT‑5.1 with advanced reasoning and user-friendly tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-munich-court-says-chatgpt-violated-music-copyright-laws"&gt;Munich court says ChatGPT violated music copyright laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-eyes-consumer-health-market-with-ai-powered-tools"&gt;OpenAI eyes consumer health market with AI-powered tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is exploring the consumer health sector, developing AI tools like personal health assistants and data aggregators, according to a report by Business Insider.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-more-families-accuse-openai-of-negligence-over-chatgpt-related-suicides"&gt;Seven more families accuse OpenAI of negligence over ChatGPT-related suicides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reaches-1-million-business-clients-in-record-time"&gt;OpenAI reaches 1 million business clients in record time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On November 5, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally now use its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries like finance, healthcare, and retail, including Amgen, Booking.com, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, T-Mobile, Target, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, are using ChatGPT and OpenAI’s developer tools to enhance operations and customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-october-2025"&gt;October 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-handles-over-a-million-suicide-related-conversations-weekly"&gt;ChatGPT handles over a million suicide-related conversations weekly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-working-on-ai-that-create-music-from-text-and-audio"&gt;OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-atlas-to-make-chatgpt-your-main-search-tool"&gt;OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-chatgpt-go-plan-to-16-more-asian-countries"&gt;OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-surpasses-800-million-weekly-active-users"&gt;ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-can-now-build-apps-inside-chatgpt"&gt;Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-chatgpt-pulse-for-personalized-morning-briefs"&gt;OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-budget-friendly-chatgpt-go-to-indonesian-users"&gt;OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Splat’s app uses AI to turn your photos into coloring pages for kids (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/splats-app-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-coloring-pages-for-kids/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there’s a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don’t want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids’ scribbled-on art projects.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3078259" height="359" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/splat-2025-12-22-at-11.33.59-AM-1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That inspired Retro’s team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or, those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To get started with Splat, you’ll take a picture or pick a photo from your Camera Roll. You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you’re prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You can also choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don’t want them sucked into a TV or game).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3078260" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?w=510" width="510" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent’s birth year.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Splat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids’ creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Splat is available on Splat is available on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent’s birth year.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Splat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids’ creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.&lt;/p&gt;
