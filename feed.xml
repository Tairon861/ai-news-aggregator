            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial intelligence has captured headlines recently for its&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;rapidly growing energy demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and particularly the surging&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;electricity usage of data centers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; that enable the training and deployment of the latest generative AI models. But it’s not all bad news — some AI tools have the potential to reduce some forms of energy consumption and enable cleaner grids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most promising applications is using AI to optimize the power grid, which would improve efficiency, increase resilience to extreme weather, and enable the integration of more renewable energy. To learn more,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Priya Donti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), whose work focuses on applying machine learning to optimize the power grid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why does the power grid need to be optimized in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We need to maintain an exact balance between the amount of power that is put into the grid and the amount that comes out at every moment in time. But on the demand side, we have some uncertainty. Power companies don’t ask customers to pre-register the amount of energy they are going to use ahead of time, so some estimation and prediction must be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on the supply side, there is typically some variation in costs and fuel availability that grid managers need to be responsive to. That has become an even bigger issue because of the integration of energy from time-varying renewable sources, like solar and wind, where uncertainty in the weather can have a major impact on how much power is available. Then, at the same time, depending on how power is flowing in the grid, there is some power lost through resistive heat on the power lines. So, as a grid operator, how do you make sure all that is working all the time? That is where optimization comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;How can AI be most useful in power grid optimization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;One way AI can be helpful is to use a combination of historical and real-time data to make more precise predictions about how much renewable energy will be available at a certain time. This could lead to a cleaner power grid by allowing us to handle and better utilize these resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI could also help tackle the complex optimization problems that power grid operators must solve to balance supply and demand in a way that also reduces costs. These optimization problems are used to determine which power generators should produce power, how much they should produce, and when they should produce it, as well as when batteries should be charged and discharged, and whether we can leverage flexibility in power loads. These optimization problems are so computationally expensive that operators use approximations so they can solve them in a feasible amount of time. But these approximations are often wrong, and when we integrate more renewable energy into the grid, they are thrown off even farther. AI can help by providing more accurate approximations in a faster manner, which can be deployed in real-time to help grid operators responsively and proactively manage the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI could also be useful in the planning of next-generation power grids. Planning for power grids requires one to use huge simulation models, so AI can play a big role in running those models more efficiently. The technology can also help with predictive maintenance by detecting where anomalous behavior on the grid is likely to happen, reducing inefficiencies that come from outages. More broadly, AI could also be applied to accelerate experimentation aimed at creating better batteries, which would allow the integration of more energy from renewable sources into the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;How should we think about the pros and cons of AI, from an energy sector perspective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One important thing to remember is that AI refers to a heterogeneous set of technologies. There are different types and sizes of models that are used, and different ways that models are used. If you are using a model that is trained on a smaller amount of data with a smaller number of parameters, that is going to consume much less energy than a large, general-purpose model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of the energy sector, there are a lot of places where, if you use these application-specific AI models for the applications they are intended for, the cost-benefit tradeoff works out in your favor. In these cases, the applications are enabling benefits from a sustainability perspective — like incorporating more renewables into the grid and supporting decarbonization strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s important to think about whether the types of investments we are making into AI are actually matched with the benefits we want from AI. On a societal level, I think the answer to that question right now is “no.” There is a lot of development and expansion of a particular subset of AI technologies, and these are not the technologies that will have the biggest benefits across energy and climate applications. I’m not saying these technologies are useless, but they are incredibly resource-intensive, while also not being responsible for the lion’s share of the benefits that could be felt in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to develop AI algorithms that respect the physical constraints of the power grid so that we can credibly deploy them. This is a hard problem to solve. If an LLM says something that is slightly incorrect, as humans, we can usually correct for that in our heads. But if you make the same magnitude of a mistake when you are optimizing a power grid, that can cause a large-scale blackout. We need to build models differently, but this also provides an opportunity to benefit from our knowledge of how the physics of the power grid works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And more broadly, I think it’s critical that those of us in the technical community put our efforts toward fostering a more democratized system of AI development and deployment, and that it’s done in a way that is aligned with the needs of on-the-ground applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multi-step workflows with a human in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-12.22.37PM.png?resize=1200,671" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals.

Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can’t have a separate [clinical trial] for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Urnov had written a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which&amp;nbsp; is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260108_GeneEditing_hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;em&gt;MIT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can’t have a separate [clinical trial] for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it.
