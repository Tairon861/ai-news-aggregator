The game is an ancient one, with sacred stature in South Korea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But inside the building, rooms once filled with the soft clatter of hands dipping into wooden bowls of stones now echo with mouse clicks. Players hunch over their monitors and replay their matches in an AI program. Others huddle around a Go board and debate the best next move, while coaches report how their choices stack up against the AI’s. Some sit in silence, watching AI programs play against each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago AlphaGo, Google DeepMind’s AI program, stunned the world by defeating the South Korean Go player Lee Sedol. And in the years since, AI has upended the game. It’s overturned centuries-old principles about the best moves and introduced entirely new ones. Players now train to replicate AI’s moves as closely as they can rather than inventing their own, even when the machine’s thinking remains mysterious to them. Today, it is essentially impossible to compete professionally without using AI. Some say the technology has drained the game of its creativity, while others think there is still room for human invention. Meanwhile, AI is democratizing access to training, and more female players are climbing the ranks as a result.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Shin Jin-seo, the top-ranked Go player in the world, AI is an invaluable training partner. Every morning, he sits at his computer and opens a program called KataGo. Nicknamed “Shintelligence” for how closely his moves mimic AI’s, he traces the glowing “blue spot” that represents the program’s suggestion for the best next move, rearranging the stones on the digital grid to try to understand the machine’s thinking. “I constantly think about why AI chose a move,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When training for a match, Shin spends most of his waking hours poring over KataGo. “It’s almost like an ascetic practice,” he says. According to a study in 2022 by the Korean Baduk League, Shin’s moves match AI’s 37.5% of the time, well above the 28.5% average the study found among all players.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“My game has changed a lot,” says Shin, “because I have to follow the directions suggested by AI to some extent.” The Korea Baduk Association says it has reached out to Google DeepMind in the hopes of arranging a match between Shin and AlphaGo, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its victory over Lee. A spokesperson for Google DeepMind said the company could not provide information at this time. But if a new match does happen, Shin, who has trained on more advanced AI programs, is optimistic that he’d win. “AlphaGo still had some flaws then, so I think I could beat it if I target those weaknesses,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI rewrites the Go playbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Go is an abstract strategy board game invented in China more than 2,500 years ago. Two players take turns placing black and white stones on a 19x19 grid, aiming to conquer territory by surrounding their opponent’s stones. It’s a game of striking mathematical complexity. The number of possible board configurations—roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;170&lt;/sup&gt;—dwarfs the number of atoms in the universe. If chess is a battle, Go is a war. You suffocate your enemy in one corner while fending off an invasion in another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To train AI to play Go, a vast trove of human Go moves are fed into a neural network, a computing system that mimics the web of neurons in the human brain. AlphaGo, which was later christened AlphaGo Lee after its victory over Lee Sedol, was trained on 30 million Go moves and refined by playing millions of games against itself. In 2017, its successor, AlphaGo Zero, picked up Go from scratch. Without studying any human games, it learned by playing against itself, with moves based only on the rules of the game. The blank-slate approach proved more powerful, unconstrained by the limits of human knowledge. After three days of training, it beat AlphaGo Lee 100 games to zero.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind retired AlphaGo that same year. But then a wave of open-source models inspired by AlphaGo Zero emerged. Today, KataGo is the program most widely used by professional Go players in South Korea. It’s faster and sharper than AlphaGo. It’s learned to predict not just who will win, but also who owns each point on the board at any given moment. While AlphaGo Zero pieced together its understanding of the board by looking at small sections, KataGo learned to read the whole board, developing better judgment for long-term strategies. Instead of just learning how to win, it learned to maximize its score.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The software has reshaped how people play. For hundreds of years, professional Go players have navigated the game’s astronomical complexity by developing heuristics that replaced brute calculation. Elegant opening strategies imposed abstract order on the empty grid. Invading corners early was a bad bargain. Each generation of Go players added new principles to the canon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But “AI has changed everything,” says Park Jeong-sang, a South Korean Go commentator. “Fundamental moves that were once considered common sense aren’t played at all today, and techniques that didn’t exist before have become popular.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The starkest shift has been in opening moves. Go starts on a blank grid, and the first 50 moves were canvases for abstract thinking and creativity, where players etched their personalities and philosophies. Lee Sedol fashioned provocative moves that invited chaos. Ke Jie, a Chinese player who was defeated by AlphaGo Master in 2017, dazzled with agile, imaginative moves. Now, players memorize the same strain of efficient, calculated opening moves suggested by AI. The crux of the game has shifted to the middle moves, where raw calculation matters more than creativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Training with AI has led to a homogenization of playing styles. Ke Jie has lamented the strain of watching the same opening moves recycled endlessly. “I feel the exact same way as the fans watching. It’s very tiring and painful to watch,” he told a Chinese news outlet in 2021. Fans revel when a player breaks from the script with offbeat moves, but those moments have become rarer. Over a third of moves by the top Go players replicate AI’s recommendations, according to a study in 2023. The first 50 moves of each game are often identical to what AI suggests, many players say.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Go has become a mind sport,” says Lee Sedol, who retired three years after his 2016 defeat to AlphaGo. “Before AI, we sought something greater. I learned Go as an art,” he says. “But if you copy your moves from an answer key, that’s no longer art.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Playing Go is no longer about charting new frontiers, some players say, but about following the dictates of a superhuman oracle. “I used to inspire fans by advancing the techniques of Go and presenting a new paradigm,” says Lee. “My reason for playing Go has vanished.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mysterious mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The players who have stayed in the game are trying to reinvent their craft. But it can be hard to discern what the new principles are.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Disarmingly slight and formidably calm, Kim Chae-young, one of the top female Go players in the world, grew up learning the game from her father, who was also a professional Go player. But when AI began to reshape the game, she found herself starting over. “I needed time to abandon everything I had learned before,” says Kim who shared her screen with me as she pointed her cursor to the blue spots suggested by KataGo. “The intuition I had built up over the years turned out to be wrong.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As she leaned close to her monitor, her blinking screen showed the winning probabilities of each move, with no explanations. Even top players like Kim and Shin don’t understand all of AI’s moves. “It seems like it’s thinking in a higher dimension,” she says. When she tries to learn from AI, she adds, “it’s less about rationally thinking through each move, but more about developing a gut feeling—an intuition.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers are trying to discover the superhuman knowledge encoded in game-playing AI programs so that humans can learn it too. In 2024, researchers at Google DeepMind extracted new chess concepts from AlphaZero, a generalized version of AlphaGo Zero that can also play chess, and taught them to chess grandmasters using chess puzzles. The Go concepts that players have picked up from AI systems so far are “probably only a small portion of what you could potentially learn,” says Nicholas Tomlin, a computer scientist at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, who coauthored a study probing Go concepts encoded in AlphaGo Zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But extracting those lessons remains a struggle. “Top-tier players haven’t yet been able to deduce the general principles behind AI moves,” says Nam Chi-hyung, a Go professor at Myongji University. Although they can emulate AI’s moves, they have yet to glean a new paradigm for the game because its reasoning is a black box, she says. Go may be in an epistemic limbo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if AI is an opaque teacher, it’s a democratic one. It has supercharged training for female Go players, who have long been underdogs of the game. For decades, training meant studying under top male players, and the most competitive matches took place in male circles that were difficult for women to break into, says Nam. “Female players never had access to that experience,” she says. “But now they can study with AI, which has made their training environment much more favorable.” More broadly, AI has narrowed the gap between players by helping everyone perfect their opening moves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Female players have climbed the ranks over the last few years as a result. In 2022, Choi Jeong, then the top female player in the world, became the first woman to reach the finals of a major international Go tournament. Dubbed “Girl Wrestler” for her fierce, combative style of play, she took on Shin. She lost, but the match broke new ground for women in Go. In 2024, Kim made headlines for winning the Korean Go League’s postseason playoffs. She was the only female player in the tournament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Training with AI has given Kim newfound confidence. Analyzing male players’ moves with AI has shattered their veneer of infallibility. “Before, I couldn't gauge just how strong top male players were—they felt invincible. Now, I know that they make mistakes, and their moves aren’t always brilliant,” she says. “AI broke the psychological barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go players find a new identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although AI has mastered Go far better than any player, fans continue to prefer watching people play. “A Go game between AI programs is not very fun for fans to watch,” says Park, the Go commentator. Such matches are too complex for fans to follow, too flawless to be thrilling, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Players can mimic AI’s opening moves, but in the middle game—where the board branches into too many possibilities to memorize—their own judgment takes over. Fans revel in watching players make mistakes and mount comebacks, exuding personality in every stone on the board. Shin's playing style is combative but marked by machinelike poise. Kim deftly navigates&amp;nbsp; the most chaotic positions on the board.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"In Go, every move is a choice you make, and your opponent responds with a choice of their own," says Kim Dae-hui, 27, a Go fan and amateur player. “Watching that process unfold is fun.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fans like Kim still watching, Shin finds meaning in his game. “I can play a kind of Go that tells a story that only a human can,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After his retirement, Lee searched for a new job where he could have an edge as a human. He started making board games, giving speeches, and teaching students at a university. “I’m looking for a new domain that I can enjoy and excel at,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But lately, he feels more hopeful for the game he left behind. “It’s every Go player’s dream to play a masterpiece game,” he says—a game of technical brilliance, with no mistakes, fought to a razor’s edge between evenly matched players. “It’s like a mirage,” Lee says, chuckling. “Maybe AI can help us play a masterpiece.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shin hopes he can do that. To Shin, AI is a teacher, a companion, and a North Star. “I may be one of the strongest human players, but with AI around, I can’t be so arrogant,” he says. “AI gives me a reason to keep improving.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260205-AIGO-tease.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Burrowed in the alleys of Hongik-dong, a hushed residential neighborhood in eastern Seoul, is a faded stone-tiled building stamped “Korea Baduk Association,” the governing body for professional Go. The game is an ancient one, with sacred stature in South Korea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But inside the building, rooms once filled with the soft clatter of hands dipping into wooden bowls of stones now echo with mouse clicks.

Nicknamed “Shintelligence” for how closely his moves mimic AI’s, he traces the glowing “blue spot” that represents the program’s suggestion for the best next move, rearranging the stones on the digital grid to try to understand the machine’s thinking. “I constantly think about why AI chose a move,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When training for a match, Shin spends most of his waking hours poring over KataGo. “It’s almost like an ascetic practice,” he says. According to a study in 2022 by the Korean Baduk League, Shin’s moves match AI’s 37.5% of the time, well above the 28.5% average the study found among all players.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“My game has changed a lot,” says Shin, “because I have to follow the directions suggested by AI to some extent.” The Korea Baduk Association says it has reached out to Google DeepMind in the hopes of arranging a match between Shin and AlphaGo, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its victory over Lee.

Such matches are too complex for fans to follow, too flawless to be thrilling, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Players can mimic AI’s opening moves, but in the middle game—where the board branches into too many possibilities to memorize—their own judgment takes over. Fans revel in watching players make mistakes and mount comebacks, exuding personality in every stone on the board. Shin's playing style is combative but marked by machinelike poise. Kim deftly navigates&amp;nbsp; the most chaotic positions on the board.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"In Go, every move is a choice you make, and your opponent responds with a choice of their own," says Kim Dae-hui, 27, a Go fan and amateur player. “Watching that process unfold is fun.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fans like Kim still watching, Shin finds meaning in his game. “I can play a kind of Go that tells a story that only a human can,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After his retirement, Lee searched for a new job where he could have an edge as a human. He started making board games, giving speeches, and teaching students at a university. “I’m looking for a new domain that I can enjoy and excel at,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But lately, he feels more hopeful for the game he left behind. “It’s every Go player’s dream to play a masterpiece game,” he says—a game of technical brilliance, with no mistakes, fought to a razor’s edge between evenly matched players. “It’s like a mirage,” Lee says, chuckling. “Maybe AI can help us play a masterpiece.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shin hopes he can do that. To Shin, AI is a teacher, a companion, and a North Star. “I may be one of the strongest human players, but with AI around, I can’t be so arrogant,” he says. “AI gives me a reason to keep improving.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/27/1133624/ai-is-rewiring-how-the-worlds-best-go-players-think/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank test agentic AI for trade surveillance (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/goldman-sachs-and-deutsche-bank-test-agentic-ai-for-trade-surveillance/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Goldman-Sachs-and-Deutsche-Bank-test-agentic-AI-for-trade-surveillance-scaled-e1772160438137.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are testing a new type of artificial intelligence, like agentic AI, that does more than scan for keywords or follow preset rules. Instead of relying only on static alerts, some trading desks are beginning to use systems designed to reason through patterns in real time and flag conduct that may need human review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; detailed how Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are exploring or deploying so-called “agentic” AI tools for trading surveillance. The goal is to strengthen oversight of orders and trades by using software agents that can analyse activity as it happens and identify patterns that could suggest misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adaptive agents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large banks use automated surveillance systems to monitor trading activity, systems that often rely on predefined rules: if a trade exceeds a certain size, deviates from a benchmark, or fits a known risk pattern, it triggers an alert. Compliance teams then review the case manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is scale and complexity. Modern markets generate huge volumes of data in asset classes, time zones, and trading venues. Static rules can generate large numbers of false positives, while more subtle forms of manipulation may not match known patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the newer agentic systems aim to go beyond that approach. Rather than simply matching trades against a checklist, the AI agents are designed to examine trading behaviour in multiple signals, compare it with historical activity, and detect unusual combinations of actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools are not described as replacing compliance officers. Instead, they appear to function as an additional layer of monitoring, surfacing cases that warrant closer human inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Deutsche Bank’s work with Google Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported that Deutsche Bank is working with Google Cloud on developing AI agents that can monitor trading activity. The system is designed to review large sets of order and execution data and flag anomalies in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been expanding its AI initiatives over the past few years, and this surveillance effort reflects how financial institutions are applying generative and large language model technology beyond chat interfaces. In this context, the AI is not answering customer questions but analysing structured and unstructured data streams tied to trading behaviour. The AI agents can help identify “complex anomalies” in orders and trades. That suggests the system may look at relationships between trades, timing, market conditions, and trader history not single events in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human compliance staff remain responsible for reviewing flagged cases and determining whether further action is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Goldman Sachs’ agentic AI strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also exploring the use of agentic AI for surveillance, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The bank has invested heavily in AI in its trading and risk systems in recent years, and this effort appears to extend that work into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus, as described in the report, is on using AI agents that can operate with a degree of independence in scanning for misconduct indicators. The system may identify patterns that do not fit a clear rule but still stand out as unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For regulators, the appeal is straightforward: earlier detection can reduce market harm and reputational risk. For banks, there is also an operational dimension. Compliance departments face pressure to handle large volumes of alerts while maintaining strict oversight standards. Tools that can reduce noise without lowering scrutiny are likely to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why “agentic AI” matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “agentic AI” refers to systems that can take goal-directed actions not respond to prompts. In practice, that can mean the software is able to decide what data to examine next, compare multiple signals, and escalate findings without constant human input. In a trading context, that might involve monitoring order flows, price movements, communications metadata, and historical behaviour to assess whether activity aligns with normal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean the system makes disciplinary decisions on its own. Financial institutions operate under strict regulatory regimes, and accountability remains with human supervisors. The agent’s role is to identify and organise information more effectively than static systems can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Part of a wider compliance shift&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What appears new is the application of more advanced generative AI architectures to internal control functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators in the US and Europe have encouraged firms to improve the monitoring of market abuse and manipulation. While rules do not mandate agentic AI, they do require firms to maintain effective systems and controls. If AI tools can help meet that standard, adoption is likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, AI in compliance raises its own questions. Banks must ensure that models are explainable, that they do not introduce bias, and that they can withstand regulatory review. Model governance, data security, and audit trails remain central concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What changes for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If agentic surveillance tools prove effective, they could alter how compliance teams work. Instead of sorting through large volumes of simple alerts, staff may spend more time evaluating complex cases surfaced by AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change would not remove the need for human judgement. It may, however, change where human effort is focused. In markets where speed and data volume continue to rise, the ability to analyse patterns in real time is becoming harder to achieve with rule-based systems alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Markus Spiske)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Mastercard’s AI payment demo points to agent-led commerce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This is happening due to poor implementation of human-AI collaboration, according to cloud data and AI consultancy, Datatonic. The company says in the next phase of enterprise AI, success will come from carefully-governed and designed AI that works alongside humans in “human-in-the-loop (HiTL)’ systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company’s research shows that companies that fail to embed AI into their human workflows are falling behind the competition as productivity slows down. Datatonic says a hybrid human-AI approach speeds up decision-making, thus improving overall operations. Scott Eivers, CEO of Datatonic says, “AI [is] about redesigning how work gets done. The biggest risk we see in the market is productivity leakage when AI exists in isolation from the people who actually run the business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After years of AI investment, pressure is mounting on businesses to show returns. However, some research shows some initiatives remaining in their pilot stage due to limited trust among users. As a result, organisations are failing to use AI-powered insights to positively affect decisions and workflows, meaning efficiency gains never materialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Datatonic, HiTL models are crucial for future success, providing a combination of AI speed with human judgement and accountability. This is evident in agent-assisted software development, where AI systems create code from loose prompts and transform them into code. In this case, human teams decide what needs to be developed, inspect all requirements, and review plans before being brought into existence. Once this direction is clear, AI agents construct modular components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trend for AI in the workplace is starting to appear in finance and operations. For instance, in back-office and finance departments, AI-powered document processing is already delivering a 70% reduction in invoice-processing costs according to some, but finance teams still approve the final outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “They’re partnership stories,” says Andrew Harding, CTO of Datatonic. “Humans create evaluation systems, validate plans, set guardrails, and make decisions. AI executes at speed and scale. That combination is where real enterprise value shows up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many enterprises are failing to deploy fully autonomous agents safely, according to Datatonic, with shortfalls in security controls and governance frameworks. Autonomy can only scale when organisations introduce approval checkpoints and benchmark performance standards. Evaluation systems must also be implemented as AI models evolve, ensuring they always operate safely and as intended without violating any compliance obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harding says, “As trust builds, companies can responsibly delegate more to AI. But skipping governance doesn’t build speed, it creates risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Datatonic predicts major acceleration in workloads in the next two years, with preparation and validation handled by AI agents. AI systems may also be implemented to test and invalidate decisions before teams invest resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Eivers believes the future “looks like expert departments run by smaller, nimble teams – finance, HR, marketing – each amplified by AI.

It’s overturned centuries-old principles about the best moves and introduced entirely new ones. Players now train to replicate AI’s moves as closely as they can rather than inventing their own, even when the machine’s thinking remains mysterious to them. Meanwhile, AI is democratizing access to training, and more female players are climbing the ranks as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is essentially impossible to compete professionally without using AI. Some say the technology has drained the game of its creativity, while others think there is still room for human invention.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Narrated: Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, Nixon had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is our latest &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

It’s overturned centuries-old principles about the best moves and introduced entirely new ones. Players now train to replicate AI’s moves as closely as they can rather than inventing their own, even when the machine’s thinking remains mysterious to them. Meanwhile, AI is democratizing access to training, and more female players are climbing the ranks as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is essentially impossible to compete professionally without using AI. Some say the technology has drained the game of its creativity, while others think there is still room for human invention.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Narrated: Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, Nixon had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is our latest &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Sentient itself acts as the architect behind frameworks like ROMA and the Dobby open-source model to assist with these coordination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on computational transparency ensures that when an automated process makes a recommendation on a portfolio, human auditors can track exactly how that conclusion was reached.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By prioritising environments that record full logic traces rather than isolated right answers, technology leaders integrating agentic AI for operations like finance can secure better ROI and maintain regulatory compliance across their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank test agentic AI for trade surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was the largest private funding round on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of its Amazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on Amazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand its previously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Trainium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Information had previously reported that $35 billion of Amazon’s investment could be contingent on the company either achieving AGI or making its IPO by the end of the year. OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI.

          &lt;p&gt;Block, the fintech group headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey, will cut its workforce by “nearly half” in one of the clearest signs of the sweeping changes AI tools are having on employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in the payment company soared more than 25 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday as it announced it would shed more than 4,000 jobs from its 10,000-strong workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We’re already seeing it internally,” Dorsey wrote in a letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A significantly smaller team, using the tools we’re building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsey, who left his role as CEO of Twitter in 2021, is among the first Silicon Valley chiefs to explicitly tie huge job cuts to the ability of AI to replace human workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has sought to play down the link to AI after announcing lay-offs totaling 30,000 roles since October, months after CEO Andy Jassy warned the technology would mean “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in the coming years, especially in white-collar roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsey said he did not think he was early to the realization about the effect that AI could have on work, but that “most companies are late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he expected a “majority of companies” would reach the same conclusion within the next year and make similar structural changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff reduction at Block comes as anxiety rises about AI leading to job losses across vast parts of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and economists are grappling with an influx of US economic data and corporate announcements in an effort to gauge the impact the technology could be having on the labor market. The latest non-farm payrolls figures were better than expected, suggesting the domestic jobs market was stabilizing, but several big US companies have committed to cutting staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, UPS, Dow, Nike, Home Depot, and others in late January announced they would be cutting a combined 52,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsey said the cuts at Block, which owns the payment processor Square, came despite what he described as a “strong” financial performance in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block has made a contrarian bet on bitcoin at a time when many payment companies favored stablecoins: cash-like digital tokens that became regulated in the US last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block’s strategy was spearheaded by Dorsey, a “bitcoin maximalist” who has said he believes the digital currency will eventually eclipse the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company offers payment services in bitcoin for merchants and consumers—and suffered a loss on its own bitcoin holdings as the price of the cryptocurrency dropped 23 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, payment companies that made a bet on stablecoins experienced a boost. Stripe earlier this week said its stablecoin transaction volumes increased fourfold last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its fiscal fourth quarter, Block reported revenue of almost $6.3 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations. Its earnings tumbled to 19 cents a share, owing to a $234 million hit on its bitcoin holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff reduction at Block comes as anxiety rises about AI leading to job losses across vast parts of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and economists are grappling with an influx of US economic data and corporate announcements in an effort to gauge the impact the technology could be having on the labor market. The latest non-farm payrolls figures were better than expected, suggesting the domestic jobs market was stabilizing, but several big US companies have committed to cutting staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, UPS, Dow, Nike, Home Depot, and others in late January announced they would be cutting a combined 52,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsey said the cuts at Block, which owns the payment processor Square, came despite what he described as a “strong” financial performance in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block has made a contrarian bet on bitcoin at a time when many payment companies favored stablecoins: cash-like digital tokens that became regulated in the US last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block’s strategy was spearheaded by Dorsey, a “bitcoin maximalist” who has said he believes the digital currency will eventually eclipse the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company offers payment services in bitcoin for merchants and consumers—and suffered a loss on its own bitcoin holdings as the price of the cryptocurrency dropped 23 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, payment companies that made a bet on stablecoins experienced a boost. Stripe earlier this week said its stablecoin transaction volumes increased fourfold last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its fiscal fourth quarter, Block reported revenue of almost $6.3 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations. Its earnings tumbled to 19 cents a share, owing to a $234 million hit on its bitcoin holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

But as the Pentagon’s Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed an open letter urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mass surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment and has a chilling effect on freedom of expression,” Dean wrote on X. “Surveillance systems are prone to misuse for political or discriminatory purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to an Axios report, the military currently can use X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT for unclassified tasks, and has been negotiating with Google and OpenAI to bring its technology over for use in classified work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Anthropic has an existing partnership with the Pentagon, the AI company has remained firm in maintaining the boundary that its AI be used for neither mass domestic surveillance, nor fully autonomous weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei&amp;nbsp;that if his company doesn’t concede, the Pentagon will either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to comply with military demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Amodei maintained his company’s position. “These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security,” the statement reads. “Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/53202070940_ea57312b1a_k.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic has reached a stalemate with the United States Department of War over the military’s request for unrestricted access to the AI company’s technology. But as the Pentagon’s Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed an open letter urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.”&amp;nbsp;More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year.&amp;nbsp;The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3097675" height="352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Perplexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just three months ago, Suno announced a $250 million funding round that valued the company at $2.45 billion. At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&amp;amp;B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth&amp;nbsp;$3 million. &lt;/p&gt;

As the AI debate has been flattened to “doomers&amp;nbsp;versus boomers,” one state legislator is&amp;nbsp;attempting&amp;nbsp;to walk a middle road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On this episode of TechCrunch’s&amp;nbsp;Equity&amp;nbsp;podcast, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Alex Bores,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;New&amp;nbsp;York&amp;nbsp;State&amp;nbsp;Assemblymember and&amp;nbsp;candidate for U.S. Congress. Bores&amp;nbsp;sponsored&amp;nbsp;New York’s first-of-its-kind AI safety&amp;nbsp;law&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;RAISE Act&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;and quickly became the target of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;Silicon Valley&amp;nbsp;lobbying group&amp;nbsp;with $125 million to spend&amp;nbsp;on attack ads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the 800 million OpenAI reported in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has raised $110 billion in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT has reached 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI announced Friday, putting the AI chatbot within striking distance of 1 billion.
