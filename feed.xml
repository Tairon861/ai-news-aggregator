It doesn’t matter. (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/apples-new-iphone-17-devices-dont-have-an-ai-powered-siri-yet-it-doesnt-matter/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iphone-17-4-up.jpg?resize=1200,662" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;At yet another splashy event, Apple on Tuesday introduced its latest lineup of iPhones: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and a new slimmer version dubbed the iPhone Air. The “Air” branding is meant to bring to mind other lightweight — and sometimes less expensive — Apple products like the MacBook Air and iPad Air. But it also recalls a time when smartphone makers were chasing an ever-thinner phone. In the AI era, however, it’s not necessarily the device’s size that matters; it’s what the software it runs can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On this front, Apple has lagged its competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its iPhone 17 event, the company only referenced AI technology a few times: to rehash some updates announced in June at WWDC, like Visual Intelligence and its on-device models, and in some aspects of its camera upgrades, like the iPhone 17’s front camera, which it calls Center Stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The most compelling use of AI wasn’t even introduced as a phone upgrade; it was the AI-powered Live Translation feature coming to Apple’s AirPods 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There was no mention of Siri at all, AI-powered or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much has been made about how Apple’s miscalculation on AI could negatively affect its industry standing and future success.&amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, Google last month rolled out its latest release of an AI-powered Android phone with its Pixel 10, as iPhone owners still await an AI Siri, which has been delayed until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, Apple has only released what could be considered baseline AI features for its devices, like AI writing tools, summarization, generative AI images (which some complain are not very good), live translation, visual search, and Genmoji, among others. Yet a digital assistant that understands a wide range of questions — without deferring to ChatGPT — or one that can provide further context from your iPhone apps remains overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, it was reported that Apple is looking to third parties to help it catch up in the AI race. An AI-enhanced Siri could be running some other technology — like Google Gemini — under the hood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At first glance, this delay, combined with the decision to rely on a third party — or even possibly a sizable acquisition — seems like it could spell bad news for Apple. However, Apple’s decision to outsource some of the phone’s AI technology could actually become a selling point for consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today’s iPhone owners often swap out Apple’s technology for Google’s by opting for Gmail, Google Drive and Docs, Google Maps, and Chrome over Apple’s own apps like Mail, its iWork suite, Apple Maps, and Safari, for example. When people search the web, they turn to Google’s Search app, not Apple’s built-in Spotlight search, despite its many integrations over the years to offer basic facts and answers, leveraging sources like Wikipedia.&amp;nbsp;Why, then, shouldn’t they be able to use Google’s AI technology, too?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Apple does proceed with a third-party deal to integrate AI into its devices, it may work out to be an even bigger win for iPhone owners. It would mean that high-performing AI technology would be integrated into the device more natively. It would feel more seamless, more a part of the iPhone experience itself than simply running an AI app. And Apple could get there without having to invest as heavily in the infrastructure required to compete in the AI race, which is good for the company’s (already healthy) bottom line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, given the speed with which AI technology has been evolving, this design would leave room for Apple to swap out models or expand support to include others, as AI companies edge themselves ahead of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The result for consumers would be the best of both worlds: the aesthetics and hardware quality (thinness and all!) of the iPhone, with Google’s technology (or Anthropic’s or OpenAI’s) powering some of the key AI components.&amp;nbsp;That could also be beneficial to Apple’s overall brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It also means that the look and feel of updated iPhones and their hardware advances will continue to drive sales and upgrades, allowing Apple to do what it does best: focus on build quality, camera improvements, privacy-preserving tech, intentional software design changes like Liquid Glass — and yes, super-thin phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple could continue to market itself as a best-in-class hardware maker first, not an AI device maker; customers could still long for the latest iPhones, as always, without having to sacrifice the latest technology advances when they make the choice to buy a phone from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, this scenario only plays out if and when Apple opts to launch a version of Siri that runs a third-party’s AI technology to enhance its own (or if it buys an AI company). But if Apple decides to only rely on its Apple Intelligence offerings without getting them up to speed quickly, the outcome could be much different.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iphone-17-4-up.jpg?resize=1200,662" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;At yet another splashy event, Apple on Tuesday introduced its latest lineup of iPhones: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and a new slimmer version dubbed the iPhone Air.

The move means that Anthropic’s tech will help power new features in Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint alongside OpenAI’s, marking the end of Microsoft’s previous reliance solely on the ChatGPT maker for its productivity suite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft’s move to diversify its AI partnerships comes amid a growing rift with OpenAI, which has pursued its own infrastructure projects as well as a potential LinkedIn competitor.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft’s Anthropic deal also comes as the company negotiates a new deal with OpenAI to secure access to its AI models after a pending for-profit restructuring. But The Information says the move isn’t a negotiating tactic. Leaders at Microsoft believe Anthropic’s latest models — Claude Sonnet 4, specifically — perform better than OpenAI’s in certain functions, like creating aesthetically pleasing PowerPoint presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t the first time Microsoft has branched out, though. While OpenAI is the default model, Microsoft offers other models like xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude through GitHub Copilot. Microsoft is also trying to set itself up for self-reliance. The company recently introduced its first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI is similarly seeking to step out from under Microsoft’s influence. Last week, OpenAI launched a jobs platform to take on Microsoft’s LinkedIn, and The Financial Times reported that OpenAI is set to begin mass production on its first AI chips in partnership with Broadcom in 2026. That means it will be able to potentially run training and inference on hardware it controls, rather than being dependent on Microsoft’s Azure setup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As we’ve said, OpenAI will continue to be our partner on frontier models and we remain committed to our long-term partnership,” Microsoft spokesperson Michael Collins told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic launched a new file creation feature for its Claude AI assistant that enables users to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents directly within conversations on the web interface and in the Claude desktop app. While the feature may be handy for Claude users, the company's support documentation also warns that it "may put your data at risk" and details how the AI assistant can be manipulated to transmit user data to external servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature, awkwardly named "Upgraded file creation and analysis," is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's Code Interpreter and an upgraded version of Anthropic's "analysis" tool. It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access "in the coming weeks," according to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. "This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk," Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. "Monitor chats closely when using this feature."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Anthropic's documentation, "a bad actor" manipulating this feature could potentially "inconspicuously add instructions via external files or websites" that manipulate Claude into "reading sensitive data from a claude.ai connected knowledge source" and "using the sandbox environment to make an external network request to leak the data."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This describes a prompt injection attack, where hidden instructions embedded in seemingly innocent content can manipulate the AI model's behavior—a vulnerability that security researchers first documented in 2022. These attacks represent a pernicious, unsolved security flaw of AI language models, since both data and instructions in how to process it are fed through as part of the "context window" to the model in the same format, making it difficult for the AI to distinguish between legitimate instructions and malicious commands hidden in user-provided content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company states in its security documentation that it discovered the vulnerabilities of the new feature through "red-teaming and security testing" before release. Anthropic's recommended mitigation for users is to "monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly," although this places the burden of security entirely on the user in what is marketed as an automated, hands-off system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent AI researcher Simon Willison, reviewing the feature today on his blog, noted that Anthropic's advice to "monitor Claude while using the feature" amounts to "unfairly outsourcing the problem to Anthropic's users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anthropic’s mitigations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is not completely ignoring the problem, however. The company has implemented several security measures for the file creation feature. For Pro and Max users, Anthropic disabled public sharing of conversations that use the file creation feature. For Enterprise users, the company implemented sandbox isolation so that environments are never shared between users. The company also limited task duration and container runtime "to avoid loops of malicious activity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Team and Enterprise administrators, Anthropic also provides an allowlist of domains Claude can access, including api.anthropic.com, github.com, registry.npmjs.org, and pypi.org. The documentation states that "Claude can only be tricked into leaking data it has access to in a conversation via an individual user's prompt, project or activated connections."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic's documentation states the company has "a continuous process for ongoing security testing and red-teaming of this feature." The company encourages organizations to "evaluate these protections against their specific security requirements when deciding whether to enable this feature."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prompt injections galore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with Anthropic's security measures, Willison says he'll be cautious. "I plan to be cautious using this feature with any data that I very much don’t want to be leaked to a third party, if there’s even the slightest chance that a malicious instruction might sneak its way in," he wrote on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We covered a similar potential prompt injection vulnerability with Anthropic's Claude for Chrome, which launched as a research preview last month. For enterprise customers considering Claude for sensitive business documents, Anthropic's decision to ship with documented vulnerabilities suggests competitive pressure may be overriding security considerations in the AI arms race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of "ship first, secure it later" philosophy has caused frustrations among some AI experts like Willison, who has extensively documented prompt injection vulnerabilities (and coined the term). He recently described the current state of AI security as "horrifying" on his blog, noting that these prompt injection vulnerabilities remain widespread "almost three years after we first started talking about them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prescient warning from September 2022, Willison wrote that "there may be systems that should not be built at all until we have a robust solution." His recent assessment in the present? "It looks like we built them anyway!"&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Anthropic launched a new file creation feature for its Claude AI assistant that enables users to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents directly within conversations on the web interface and in the Claude desktop app. While the feature may be handy for Claude users, the company's support documentation also warns that it "may put your data at risk" and details how the AI assistant can be manipulated to transmit user data to external servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature, awkwardly named "Upgraded file creation and analysis," is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's Code Interpreter and an upgraded version of Anthropic's "analysis" tool. It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access "in the coming weeks," according to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. "This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk," Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. "Monitor chats closely when using this feature."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Anthropic's documentation, "a bad actor" manipulating this feature could potentially "inconspicuously add instructions via external files or websites" that manipulate Claude into "reading sensitive data from a claude.ai connected knowledge source" and "using the sandbox environment to make an external network request to leak the data."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This describes a prompt injection attack, where hidden instructions embedded in seemingly innocent content can manipulate the AI model's behavior—a vulnerability that security researchers first documented in 2022. These attacks represent a pernicious, unsolved security flaw of AI language models, since both data and instructions in how to process it are fed through as part of the "context window" to the model in the same format, making it difficult for the AI to distinguish between legitimate instructions and malicious commands hidden in user-provided content.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company states in its security documentation that it discovered the vulnerabilities of the new feature through "red-teaming and security testing" before release. Anthropic's recommended mitigation for users is to "monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly," although this places the burden of security entirely on the user in what is marketed as an automated, hands-off system.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Reddit has addressed a problem where the description of subreddits originally written by moderators appeared differently—and, often, inaccurately—on Reddit’s Android app. For weeks, the problem was largely suspected to be caused by Reddit clumsily using generative AI to create new subreddit descriptions. However, Reddit says that the changes were the fault of a bug tied to its AI-powered translation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit’s Android app started surfacing on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. On August 29, a moderator&amp;nbsp;reported on the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from “The wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth” to “The crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.” The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians’ Android app description described the community as “a place for straight and transgender lesbians …” instead of “a place for cis and trans lesbians …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other complaints followed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose description was changed to say that it is a group for “parents of autistic children.” A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our subreddit’s users have seen their communities get overrun time and time again, so it is completely understandable that there would be a great deal of panic and concern when it became apparent that the description had been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reddit blames a translation glitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a Reddit admin, going by redtaboo on the site, apologized and offered an explanation for the inaccurate subreddit descriptions, saying that "a bug with our translation service took to translating from [E]nglish to [E]nglish."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Explaining further to Ars, Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a small bug in a test we ran that mistakenly caused the English-to-English translation(s) you saw. That bug has been resolved. Unsurprisingly, English-to-English translations are not part of our strategy, as they aren't necessary. English-to-English translations were not a desired or expected outcome of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit pulled the test it was running,&amp;nbsp;but its machine learning-powered translations are still functioning, Rathschmidt said. The company plans to fix the bug and run its unspecified "test" again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s explanation differs from user theories floating around beforehand, which were mainly that Reddit was rewriting user-created summaries with generative AI, possibly to boost SEO. Some may still be perturbed by the problem persisting for weeks without explanation and the apparent lack of manual checks for the translation service. However, Redditors can now take comfort in knowing that Reddit is not currently using generative AI to alter user-generated content without notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paige_Railstone, however, maintains frustration and wants to tell Reddit admins, “STOP. Hand off.” The translation bug, they noted, led to people posting on a subreddit for parents with autism that their child might be autistic, “and how terrible that would be for them,” Paige_Railstone recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are the kind of unintentionally insulting posts that drive autistics into leaving a community, and it increases the workload of us moderators,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paige_Railstone also sees the incident as a reason for moderators to be more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This never used to be a concern, but this translation service was rolled out without any notification that I’m aware of, and no option to disable it within the mods' control. That has the potential to cause problems, as we’ve seen over the past two weeks,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Reddit has addressed a problem where the description of subreddits originally written by moderators appeared differently—and, often, inaccurately—on Reddit’s Android app. For weeks, the problem was largely suspected to be caused by Reddit clumsily using generative AI to create new subreddit descriptions. However, Reddit says that the changes were the fault of a bug tied to its AI-powered translation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit’s Android app started surfacing on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. On August 29, a moderator&amp;nbsp;reported on the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from “The wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth” to “The crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.” The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians’ Android app description described the community as “a place for straight and transgender lesbians …” instead of “a place for cis and trans lesbians …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other complaints followed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose description was changed to say that it is a group for “parents of autistic children.” A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our subreddit’s users have seen their communities get overrun time and time again, so it is completely understandable that there would be a great deal of panic and concern when it became apparent that the description had been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reddit blames a translation glitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a Reddit admin, going by redtaboo on the site, apologized and offered an explanation for the inaccurate subreddit descriptions, saying that "a bug with our translation service took to translating from [E]nglish to [E]nglish."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Explaining further to Ars, Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a small bug in a test we ran that mistakenly caused the English-to-English translation(s) you saw. That bug has been resolved. Unsurprisingly, English-to-English translations are not part of our strategy, as they aren't necessary. English-to-English translations were not a desired or expected outcome of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit pulled the test it was running,&amp;nbsp;but its machine learning-powered translations are still functioning, Rathschmidt said. The company plans to fix the bug and run its unspecified "test" again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s explanation differs from user theories floating around beforehand, which were mainly that Reddit was rewriting user-created summaries with generative AI, possibly to boost SEO. Some may still be perturbed by the problem persisting for weeks without explanation and the apparent lack of manual checks for the translation service. However, Redditors can now take comfort in knowing that Reddit is not currently using generative AI to alter user-generated content without notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paige_Railstone, however, maintains frustration and wants to tell Reddit admins, “STOP.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Felicis, a returning investor, is considering doubling down on the company for the Series C, according to two sources. Felicis declined to comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is currently targeting a valuation of $10 billion or more, one person said. That’s up from an $8 billion target valuation that the company discussed a couple of months ago, one person said. However, terms of the final deal could still change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has told potential investors that it already has multiple offers. VCs have been reaching out to Mercor preemptively with offers valuing the company at as much as $10 billion, the Information previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch also understands that the company has brought on at least two new investors to raise funds for the potential deal through special purpose vehicles (SPVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s previous round was announced in February – a $100 million Series B at a $2 billion valuation led by Felicis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2022, Mercor is approaching $450 million in annualized run-rate revenue, one person said. The company told TechCrunch in February that its annual revenue (calculated by multiplying the latest month by 12) had reached $75 million at that time. In March, Mercor CEO Brendan Foody posted on X that ARR was $100 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has told investors it is on track to hit the $500 million ARR milestone faster than Anysphere,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the startup that makes AI coding assistant Cursor, according to one source familiar with the situation. Anysphere famously hit $500 million in ARR about a year after its product launched. Unlike Anysphere, which is still burning cash, Mercor generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor earns revenue by providing companies with specialized domain experts to&amp;nbsp; perform AI model training — such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers — and charging an hourly finder’s fee and matching rate for their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company claims to supply data labeling contractors to five top AI labs, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as to Tesla and Nvidia. According to sources, an outsized portion of its revenue is coming from a subset of those brands, including OpenAI.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To further diversify its business model, Mercor has been telling investors that it is adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning –&amp;nbsp; a training method where a model or agent’s decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company also intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Mercor faces competition from companies like Surge AI, which is reportedly in talks to raise funding at a $25 billion valuation, as well as from Turing Labs and other data labeling firms like Scale AI that are also expanding into RL services. Some believe that OpenAI’s recently launched hiring platform could lead the AI giant to create its own human-expert-powered RL training service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When reached for comment, Foody told TechCrunch, “We haven’t been trying to raise at all,” and, “We turn down offers every month.” He also said the company’s ARR is higher than $450 million. However, he clarified that the company’s revenue includes the total amount that customers pay Mercor for services before its contractors receive their portion. He added this is a common accounting practice recommended by audit firms and used by competitors Surge AI and Scale AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was co-founded in 2023 by Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts Brendan Foody (CEO), Adarsh Hiremath (CTO), and Surya Midha (COO). All three co-founders are still in their early twenties. To take the company to the next level, Mercor recently appointed Sundeep Jain, a former chief product officer at Uber with decades of experience, as its first president, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor was recently sued by competitor Scale AI for misappropriation of trade secrets. Scale AI alleges that one of its former employees who later joined Mercor “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy of the lawsuit TechCrunch previously reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has told investors it is on track to hit the $500 million ARR milestone faster than Anysphere,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the startup that makes AI coding assistant Cursor, according to one source familiar with the situation. Anysphere famously hit $500 million in ARR about a year after its product launched. Unlike Anysphere, which is still burning cash, Mercor generated $6 million in profit in the first half of the year, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor earns revenue by providing companies with specialized domain experts to&amp;nbsp; perform AI model training — such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers — and charging an hourly finder’s fee and matching rate for their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company claims to supply data labeling contractors to five top AI labs, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as to Tesla and Nvidia. According to sources, an outsized portion of its revenue is coming from a subset of those brands, including OpenAI.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To further diversify its business model, Mercor has been telling investors that it is adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning –&amp;nbsp; a training method where a model or agent’s decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company also intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Mercor faces competition from companies like Surge AI, which is reportedly in talks to raise funding at a $25 billion valuation, as well as from Turing Labs and other data labeling firms like Scale AI that are also expanding into RL services. Some believe that OpenAI’s recently launched hiring platform could lead the AI giant to create its own human-expert-powered RL training service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When reached for comment, Foody told TechCrunch, “We haven’t been trying to raise at all,” and, “We turn down offers every month.” He also said the company’s ARR is higher than $450 million. However, he clarified that the company’s revenue includes the total amount that customers pay Mercor for services before its contractors receive their portion. He added this is a common accounting practice recommended by audit firms and used by competitors Surge AI and Scale AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was co-founded in 2023 by Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts Brendan Foody (CEO), Adarsh Hiremath (CTO), and Surya Midha (COO). All three co-founders are still in their early twenties. To take the company to the next level, Mercor recently appointed Sundeep Jain, a former chief product officer at Uber with decades of experience, as its first president, Forbes reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor was recently sued by competitor Scale AI for misappropriation of trade secrets. Scale AI alleges that one of its former employees who later joined Mercor “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy of the lawsuit TechCrunch previously reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
