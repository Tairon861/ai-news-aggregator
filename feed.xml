&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Marsha Blackburn — a Republican from Tennessee — said that when Gemma was asked, “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” it responded by falsely claiming that during a 1987 state senate campaign, a state trooper alleged that Blackburn “pressured him to obtain prescription drugs for her and that the relationship involved non-consensual acts.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“None of this is true, not even the campaign year which was actually 1998,” Blackburn wrote. While there are links to news articles that supposedly support these claims, she said, “The links lead to error pages and unrelated news articles. There has never been such an accusation, there is no such individual, and there are no such news stories.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also said that during a recent Senate Commerce hearing, Blackburn brought up conservative activist Robby Starbuck’s lawsuit against Google, in which Starbuck claims Google’s AI models (including Gemma) generated defamatory claims about him being a “child rapist” and “serial sexual abuser.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As recounted in Blackburn’s letter, Google’s Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Markham Erickson responded that hallucinations are a known issue and Google is “working hard to mitigate them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blackburn’s letter argued that on the contrary, Gemma’s fabrications are “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but rather “an act of defamation produced and distributed by a Google-owned AI model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;President Donald Trump’s tech industry supporters have complained that “AI censorship” causes popular chatbots to show a liberal bias, and Trump even signed an executive order banning “woke AI” earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Blackburn hasn’t always backed the Trump administration’s tech policies — she helped to strip a moratorium on state-level AI regulation from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — she echoed those complaints in her letter, writing that there’s “a consistent pattern of bias against conservative figures demonstrated by Google’s AI systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a Friday night post on X, Google did not reference the specifics of Blackburn’s letter, but the company said it’s “seen reports of non-developers trying to use Gemma in AI Studio and ask it factual questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We never intended this to be a consumer tool or model, or to be used this way,” the company said. (Google promotes Gemma as a family of open, lightweight models that developers can integrate into their own products, while AI Studio is the company’s web-based development environment for AI-powered apps.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result, Google said it’s removing Gemma from AI Studio while continuing to make the models available via API.&lt;/p&gt;

(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/kevin-roses-simple-test-for-ai-hardware-would-you-want-to-punch-someone-in-the-face-whos-wearing-it/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54889293139_d6dbc89df2_k.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Kevin Rose has a visceral rule for evaluating AI hardware investments: “If you feel like you should punch someone in the face for wearing it, you probably shouldn’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a typically candid assessment from the veteran investor, and one born from watching the current wave of AI hardware startups repeat mistakes he’s seen before. Rose, a general partner at True Ventures and early investor in Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit, has largely avoided the AI hardware gold rush that’s consumed Silicon Valley. While other VCs rush to fund the next smart glasses or AI pendant, Rose is taking a decidedly different approach.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of it is just like, ‘Let’s listen to the entire conversation,’” Rose says of the current crop of AI wearables. “And to me, that breaks a lot of these social constructs that we have with humans around privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose speaks from experience. He was on the board of Oura, which now commands 80% of the smart ring market, and he’s witnessed firsthand what separates successful wearables from failed ones. The difference isn’t just technical capability; it’s emotional resonance and social acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As an investor, you kind of have to not only say, okay, cool tech, sure, but emotionally, how does it make me feel? And how does it make others feel around me?” he explained on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. “And for me, a lot of that is lost in all the AI stuff, where it’s just always on, always listening, trying to be the smartest person in the room. And it’s just not healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He admits to trying various AI wearables himself, including the failed Humane AI pendant that briefly caught the world’s attention a year ago. But the breaking point came during an argument with his wife. “I was like, I know I didn’t say that. And I was trying to use it to actually win an argument,” he recalled. “That was the last time I wore that thing. You do not want to win a battle by going back and looking at the logs of your AI pin. That doesn’t fly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tourist use case — asking your glasses what monument you’re looking at — isn’t good enough, Rose said. “We tend to bolt AI onto everything and it’s ruining the world,” he said, pointing to features like photo apps that let you erase people from the background. “I had a friend who erased a gate from behind him to make the picture look better. I’m like, ‘That’s your yard! Your kids are gonna look at that and be like, ‘Didn’t we have a gate there?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rose worries we’re in an “early days of social media” moment with AI — making decisions that seem harmless now but will haunt us later. “We’re gonna look back and be like, ‘Wow, that was weird. We just slapped AI on everything, and thought it was a good idea,’ similar to what happened in the early days of social. We look back a decade or two later, and you’re like, ‘I wish I would have done that differently.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He’s experiencing these tensions firsthand with his young children. Using OpenAI’s video generation tool Sora to create videos of tiny Labradoodles, his kids asked where they could get those puppies. “I’m like, that’s not really Dad there. How do you have that conversation? Very awkward,” he says. His solution, he said, is treating AI like movie magic, explaining that just as actors aren’t really flying on screen, Dad’s puppies aren’t real either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Rose isn’t a Luddite. He’s deeply optimistic about how AI is transforming entrepreneurship itself, and by extension, the venture capital industry that funds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are just shrinking with every day that goes by,” Rose observed. He recounted a colleague who had never used AI coding tools before building and deploying a complete app during a drive from LA to San Francisco. Six months ago, the same task would have taken ten times as long and required navigating dozens of errors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In three months, when [Google’s] Gemini 3 hits the market, there’s going to be zero errors or next to it,” Rose predicted. “High school coding classes are no longer coding classes — they’re vibe coding classes, and they will build the next billion-dollar business launched out of some random high school. It will happen. It’s just a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These developments completely change the VC equation, Rose said. Entrepreneurs can now delay fundraising until they absolutely need it, or potentially skip raising outside funding altogether. “It’s really going to change the world of VC, and I think for the better,” Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many venture firms have responded by hiring armies of engineers—Sequoia Capital, for instance, now employs as many developers as investors. But Rose doesn’t think that’s the answer. Instead, he believes the value proposition for VCs shifts to something more fundamental. “At the end of the day, the entrepreneur is going to have issues that are not technical,” he argued. “They’re very emotional problems. And so I think the VCs with the highest EQ that can show up best for the founders as their long term partner — that have been with firms and aren’t hopping around, that aren’t just fly-by-night VCs but have been around and seen these problems at scale — they’re going to be sought after.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does Rose look for when making investments? He circles back to something Larry Page told him years ago when Rose was at Google Ventures, his first institutional investing job after co-founding the social news platform Digg and before joining True Ventures in 2017. “A healthy disregard for the impossible is what’s important to look for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want founders that aren’t just sanding down the rough edges, but they’re really swinging for the fences with big, bold ideas that everyone else says, ‘That is a horrible idea. Why are you doing this?’” Rose said. “That’s what I’m drawn to. Because even if it doesn’t work, we love your mind. We love where you are, and we gladly back you the second time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54889293139_d6dbc89df2_k.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Kevin Rose has a visceral rule for evaluating AI hardware investments: “If you feel like you should punch someone in the face for wearing it, you probably shouldn’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Managing a power grid is like trying to solve an enormous puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid operators must ensure the proper amount of power is flowing to the right areas at the exact time when it is needed, and they must do this in a way that minimizes costs without overloading physical infrastructure. Even more, they must solve this complicated problem repeatedly, as rapidly as possible, to meet constantly changing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help crack this consistent conundrum, MIT researchers developed a problem-solving tool that finds the optimal solution much faster than traditional approaches while ensuring the solution doesn’t violate any of the system’s constraints. In a power grid, constraints could be things like generator and line capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new tool incorporates a feasibility-seeking step into a powerful machine-learning model trained to solve the problem. The feasibility-seeking step uses the model’s prediction as a starting point, iteratively refining the solution until it finds the best achievable answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT system can unravel complex problems several times faster than traditional solvers, while providing strong guarantees of success. For some extremely complex problems, it could find better solutions than tried-and-true tools. The technique also outperformed pure machine learning approaches, which are fast but can’t always find feasible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping schedule power production in an electric grid, this new tool could be applied to many types of complicated problems, such as designing new products, managing investment portfolios, or planning production to meet consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solving these especially thorny problems well requires us to combine tools from machine learning, optimization, and electrical engineering to develop methods that hit the right tradeoffs in terms of providing value to the domain, while also meeting its requirements. You have to look at the needs of the application and design methods in a way that actually fulfills those needs,” says Priya Donti, the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donti, senior author of an open-access paper on this new tool, called FSNet, is joined by lead author Hoang Nguyen, an EECS graduate student. The paper will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring optimal power flow in an electric grid is an extremely hard problem that is becoming more difficult for operators to solve quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we try to integrate more renewables into the grid, operators must deal with the fact that the amount of power generation is going to vary moment to moment. At the same time, there are many more distributed devices to coordinate,” Donti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid operators often rely on traditional solvers, which provide mathematical guarantees that the optimal solution doesn’t violate any problem constraints. But these tools can take hours or even days to arrive at that solution if the problem is especially convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, deep-learning models can solve even very hard problems in a fraction of the time, but the solution might ignore some important constraints. For a power grid operator, this could result in issues like unsafe voltage levels or even grid outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine-learning models struggle to satisfy all the constraints due to the many errors that occur during the training process,” Nguyen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For FSNet, the researchers combined the best of both approaches into a two-step problem-solving framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on feasibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first step, a neural network predicts a solution to the optimization problem. Very loosely inspired by neurons in the human brain, neural networks are deep learning models that excel at recognizing patterns in data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, a traditional solver that has been incorporated into FSNet performs a feasibility-seeking step. This optimization algorithm iteratively refines the initial prediction while ensuring the solution does not violate any constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the feasibility-seeking step is based on a mathematical model of the problem, it can guarantee the solution is deployable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This step is very important. In FSNet, we can have the rigorous guarantees that we need in practice,” Hoang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed FSNet to address both main types of constraints (equality and inequality) at the same time. This makes it easier to use than other approaches that may require customizing the neural network or solving for each type of constraint separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here, you can just plug and play with different optimization solvers,” Donti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By thinking differently about how the neural network solves complex optimization problems, the researchers were able to unlock a new technique that works better, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared FSNet to traditional solvers and pure machine-learning approaches on a range of challenging problems, including power grid optimization. Their system cut solving times by orders of magnitude compared to the baseline approaches, while respecting all problem constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FSNet also found better solutions to some of the trickiest problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this was surprising to us, it does make sense. Our neural network can figure out by itself some additional structure in the data that the original optimization solver was not designed to exploit,” Donti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to make FSNet less memory-intensive, incorporate more efficient optimization algorithms, and scale it up to tackle more realistic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding solutions to challenging optimization problems that are feasible is paramount to finding ones that are close to optimal. Especially for physical systems like power grids, close to optimal means nothing without feasibility. This work provides an important step toward ensuring that deep-learning models can produce predictions that satisfy constraints, with explicit guarantees on constraint enforcement,” says Kyri Baker, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Managing a power grid is like trying to solve an enormous puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid operators must ensure the proper amount of power is flowing to the right areas at the exact time when it is needed, and they must do this in a way that minimizes costs without overloading physical infrastructure. Even more, they must solve this complicated problem repeatedly, as rapidly as possible, to meet constantly changing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help crack this consistent conundrum, MIT researchers developed a problem-solving tool that finds the optimal solution much faster than traditional approaches while ensuring the solution doesn’t violate any of the system’s constraints. In a power grid, constraints could be things like generator and line capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new tool incorporates a feasibility-seeking step into a powerful machine-learning model trained to solve the problem. The feasibility-seeking step uses the model’s prediction as a starting point, iteratively refining the solution until it finds the best achievable answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT system can unravel complex problems several times faster than traditional solvers, while providing strong guarantees of success. For some extremely complex problems, it could find better solutions than tried-and-true tools. The technique also outperformed pure machine learning approaches, which are fast but can’t always find feasible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping schedule power production in an electric grid, this new tool could be applied to many types of complicated problems, such as designing new products, managing investment portfolios, or planning production to meet consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solving these especially thorny problems well requires us to combine tools from machine learning, optimization, and electrical engineering to develop methods that hit the right tradeoffs in terms of providing value to the domain, while also meeting its requirements. You have to look at the needs of the application and design methods in a way that actually fulfills those needs,” says Priya Donti, the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donti, senior author of an open-access paper on this new tool, called FSNet, is joined by lead author Hoang Nguyen, an EECS graduate student. The paper will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring optimal power flow in an electric grid is an extremely hard problem that is becoming more difficult for operators to solve quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we try to integrate more renewables into the grid, operators must deal with the fact that the amount of power generation is going to vary moment to moment. At the same time, there are many more distributed devices to coordinate,” Donti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid operators often rely on traditional solvers, which provide mathematical guarantees that the optimal solution doesn’t violate any problem constraints. But these tools can take hours or even days to arrive at that solution if the problem is especially convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, deep-learning models can solve even very hard problems in a fraction of the time, but the solution might ignore some important constraints. For a power grid operator, this could result in issues like unsafe voltage levels or even grid outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine-learning models struggle to satisfy all the constraints due to the many errors that occur during the training process,” Nguyen explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For FSNet, the researchers combined the best of both approaches into a two-step problem-solving framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on feasibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first step, a neural network predicts a solution to the optimization problem.
