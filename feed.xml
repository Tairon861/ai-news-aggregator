&lt;p&gt;xAI continues to face backlash over its Memphis data center, as the NAACP joined groups today appealing the issuance of a recently granted permit that the groups say will allow xAI to introduce major new sources of pollutants without warning at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle over the gas turbines powering xAI's data center began last April when thermal imaging seemed to show that the firm was lying about dozens of seemingly operational turbines that could be a major source of smog-causing pollution. By June, the NAACP got involved, notifying the Shelby County Health Department (SCHD) of its intent to sue xAI to force Elon Musk's AI company to engage with community members in historically Black neighborhoods who are believed to be most affected by the pollution risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the NAACP's letter seemingly did nothing to stop the SCHD from granting the permits two weeks later on July 2, as well as exemptions that xAI does not appear to qualify for, the appeal noted. Now, the NAACP—alongside environmental justice groups; the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC); and Young, Gifted and Green—is appealing. The groups are hoping the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board will revoke the permit and block the exemptions, agreeing that the SCHD's decisions were fatally flawed, violating the Clean Air Act and local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHD's permit granted xAI permission to operate 15 gas turbines at the Memphis data center, while the SELC's imaging showed that xAI was potentially operating as many as 24. Prior to the permitting, xAI was accused of operating at least 35 turbines without the best-available pollution controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their appeal, the NAACP and other groups argued that the SCHD put xAI profits over Black people's health, granting unlawful exemptions while turning a blind eye to xAI's operations, which allegedly started in 2024 but were treated as brand new in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the groups claimed that the health department "improperly ignored" the prior turbine activity and the additional turbines still believed to be on site, unlawfully deeming some of the turbines as "temporary" and designating xAI's facility a new project with no prior emissions sources. Had xAI's data center been categorized as a modification to an existing major source of pollutants, the appeal said, xAI would've faced stricter emissions controls and "robust ambient air quality impacts assessments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps more concerningly, the exemptions granted could allow xAI—or any other emerging major sources of pollutants in the area—to "install and operate any number of new polluting turbines at any time without any written approval from the Health Department, without any public notice or public participation, and without pollution controls," the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCHD and xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials accused of cherry-picking Clean Air Act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal called out the SCHD for "tellingly" omitting key provisions of the Clean Air Act that allegedly undermined the department's "position" when explaining why xAI qualified for exemptions. Groups also suggested that xAI was getting preferential treatment, providing as evidence a side-by-side comparison of a permit with stricter emissions requirements granted to a natural gas power plant, issued within months of granting xAI's permit with only generalized emissions requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Department cannot cherry pick which parts of the federal Clean Air Act it believes are relevant," the appeal said, calling the SCHD's decisions a "blatant" misrepresentation of the federal law while pointing to statements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that allegedly "directly" contradict the health department's position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some Memphians protesting xAI's facility, it seems "indisputable" that xAI's turbines fall outside of the Clean Air Act requirements, whether they're temporary or permanent, and if that's true, it is "undeniable" that the activity violates the law. They're afraid the health department is prioritizing xAI's corporate gains over their health by "failing to establish enforceable emission limits" on the data center, which powers what xAI hypes as the world's largest AI supercomputer, Colossus, the engine behind its controversial Grok models.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a minor source, as the SCHD designated the facility, Memphians think the data center is already a major source of pollutants, with its permitted turbines releasing, at minimum, 900 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per year. That's more than three times the threshold that the Clean Air Act uses to define a major source: "one that 'emits, or has the potential to emit,' at least 250 tons of NOx per year," the appeal noted. Further, the allegedly overlooked additional turbines that were on site at xAI when permitting was granted "have the potential to emit at least 560 tons of NOx per year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so far, Memphians appear stuck with the SCHD's generalized emissions requirements and xAI's voluntary emission limits, which the appeal alleged "fall short" of the stringent limits imposed if xAI were forced to use best-available control technologies. Fixing that is "especially critical given the ongoing and worsening smog problem in Memphis," environmental groups alleged, which is an area that has "failed to meet EPA’s air quality standard for ozone for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI also apparently conducted some "air dispersion modeling" to appease critics. But, again, that process was not comparable to the more rigorous analysis that would've been required to get what the EPA calls a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit, the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Groups want xAI’s permit revoked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shield Memphians from ongoing health risks, the NAACP and environmental justice groups have urged the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board to act now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memphis is a city already grappling with high rates of emergency room visits and deaths from asthma, with cancer rates four times the national average. Residents have already begun wearing masks, avoiding the outdoors, and keeping their windows closed since xAI's data center moved in, the appeal noted. Residents remain "deeply concerned" about feared exposure to alleged pollutants that can "cause a variety of adverse health effects," including "increased risk of lung infection, aggravated respiratory diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and increased frequency of asthma attack," as well as certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In an SELC press release, LaTricea Adams, CEO and President of Young, Gifted and Green, called the SCHD's decisions on xAI's permit "reckless."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a Black woman born and raised in Memphis, I know firsthand how industry harms Black communities while those in power cower away from justice," Adams said. "The Shelby County Health Department needs to do their job to protect the health of ALL Memphians, especially those in frontline communities… that are burdened with a history of environmental racism, legacy pollution, and redlining."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups also suspect xAI is stockpiling dozens of gas turbines to potentially power a second facility nearby—which could lead to over 90 turbines in operation. To get that facility up and running, Musk claimed that he will be "copying and pasting" the process for launching the first data center, SELC's press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups appealing have asked the board to revoke xAI's permits and declare that xAI's turbines do not qualify for exemptions from the Clean Air Act or other laws and that all permits for gas turbines must meet strict EPA standards. If successful, groups could force xAI to redo the permitting process "pursuant to the major source requirements of the Clean Air Act" and local law. At the very least, they've asked the board to remand the permit to the health department to "reconsider its determinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the pollution control board intervenes, Memphians worry xAI's "unlawful conduct risks being repeated and evading review," with any turbines removed easily brought back with "no notice" to residents if xAI's exemptions remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is stopping xAI from installing additional unpermitted turbines at any time to meet its widely-publicized demand for additional power," the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAACP's director of environmental justice, Abre' Conner, confirmed in the SELC's press release that his group and community members "have repeatedly shared concerns that xAI is causing a significant increase in the pollution of the air Memphians breathe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The health department should focus on people’s health—not on maximizing corporate gain," Conner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the groups claimed that the health department "improperly ignored" the prior turbine activity and the additional turbines still believed to be on site, unlawfully deeming some of the turbines as "temporary" and designating xAI's facility a new project with no prior emissions sources. Had xAI's data center been categorized as a modification to an existing major source of pollutants, the appeal said, xAI would've faced stricter emissions controls and "robust ambient air quality impacts assessments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps more concerningly, the exemptions granted could allow xAI—or any other emerging major sources of pollutants in the area—to "install and operate any number of new polluting turbines at any time without any written approval from the Health Department, without any public notice or public participation, and without pollution controls," the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCHD and xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials accused of cherry-picking Clean Air Act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal called out the SCHD for "tellingly" omitting key provisions of the Clean Air Act that allegedly undermined the department's "position" when explaining why xAI qualified for exemptions. Groups also suggested that xAI was getting preferential treatment, providing as evidence a side-by-side comparison of a permit with stricter emissions requirements granted to a natural gas power plant, issued within months of granting xAI's permit with only generalized emissions requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Department cannot cherry pick which parts of the federal Clean Air Act it believes are relevant," the appeal said, calling the SCHD's decisions a "blatant" misrepresentation of the federal law while pointing to statements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that allegedly "directly" contradict the health department's position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some Memphians protesting xAI's facility, it seems "indisputable" that xAI's turbines fall outside of the Clean Air Act requirements, whether they're temporary or permanent, and if that's true, it is "undeniable" that the activity violates the law. They're afraid the health department is prioritizing xAI's corporate gains over their health by "failing to establish enforceable emission limits" on the data center, which powers what xAI hypes as the world's largest AI supercomputer, Colossus, the engine behind its controversial Grok models.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a minor source, as the SCHD designated the facility, Memphians think the data center is already a major source of pollutants, with its permitted turbines releasing, at minimum, 900 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per year. That's more than three times the threshold that the Clean Air Act uses to define a major source: "one that 'emits, or has the potential to emit,' at least 250 tons of NOx per year," the appeal noted. Further, the allegedly overlooked additional turbines that were on site at xAI when permitting was granted "have the potential to emit at least 560 tons of NOx per year."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so far, Memphians appear stuck with the SCHD's generalized emissions requirements and xAI's voluntary emission limits, which the appeal alleged "fall short" of the stringent limits imposed if xAI were forced to use best-available control technologies. Fixing that is "especially critical given the ongoing and worsening smog problem in Memphis," environmental groups alleged, which is an area that has "failed to meet EPA’s air quality standard for ozone for years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI also apparently conducted some "air dispersion modeling" to appease critics. But, again, that process was not comparable to the more rigorous analysis that would've been required to get what the EPA calls a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit, the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Groups want xAI’s permit revoked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shield Memphians from ongoing health risks, the NAACP and environmental justice groups have urged the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board to act now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memphis is a city already grappling with high rates of emergency room visits and deaths from asthma, with cancer rates four times the national average. Residents have already begun wearing masks, avoiding the outdoors, and keeping their windows closed since xAI's data center moved in, the appeal noted. Residents remain "deeply concerned" about feared exposure to alleged pollutants that can "cause a variety of adverse health effects," including "increased risk of lung infection, aggravated respiratory diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and increased frequency of asthma attack," as well as certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an SELC press release, LaTricea Adams, CEO and President of Young, Gifted and Green, called the SCHD's decisions on xAI's permit "reckless."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a Black woman born and raised in Memphis, I know firsthand how industry harms Black communities while those in power cower away from justice," Adams said. "The Shelby County Health Department needs to do their job to protect the health of ALL Memphians, especially those in frontline communities… that are burdened with a history of environmental racism, legacy pollution, and redlining."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups also suspect xAI is stockpiling dozens of gas turbines to potentially power a second facility nearby—which could lead to over 90 turbines in operation. To get that facility up and running, Musk claimed that he will be "copying and pasting" the process for launching the first data center, SELC's press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups appealing have asked the board to revoke xAI's permits and declare that xAI's turbines do not qualify for exemptions from the Clean Air Act or other laws and that all permits for gas turbines must meet strict EPA standards. If successful, groups could force xAI to redo the permitting process "pursuant to the major source requirements of the Clean Air Act" and local law. At the very least, they've asked the board to remand the permit to the health department to "reconsider its determinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the pollution control board intervenes, Memphians worry xAI's "unlawful conduct risks being repeated and evading review," with any turbines removed easily brought back with "no notice" to residents if xAI's exemptions remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing is stopping xAI from installing additional unpermitted turbines at any time to meet its widely-publicized demand for additional power," the appeal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAACP's director of environmental justice, Abre' Conner, confirmed in the SELC's press release that his group and community members "have repeatedly shared concerns that xAI is causing a significant increase in the pollution of the air Memphians breathe."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The health department should focus on people’s health—not on maximizing corporate gain," Conner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Indian government’s $750 million National Quantum Mission has co-led QpiAI’s all-equity Series A round, alongside Avataar Ventures, at a post-money valuation of $162 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding reflects India’s broader push to establish itself as a quantum computing power. Launched in 2023, the National Quantum Mission is an Indian government initiative that views quantum computing as both an economic opportunity and a national security imperative. The program aims to help develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits within eight years across platforms including superconducting and photonics. It also targets the development of satellite-based quantum communications, inter-city quantum distribution, multi-node quantum networks, magnetometers, and the design and synthesis of quantum materials, including superconductors, semiconductor structures, and topological materials for quantum device fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;QpiAI is one of eight startups selected by the National Quantum Mission, each receiving an initial grant of up to $3.5 million. Among these companies, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has subsidiaries in the U.S. and Finland, says it has built India’s first full-stack quantum computer, called QpiAI-Indus, which it launched in April with 25 superconducting qubits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2019, QpiAI says it integrates quantum computing and AI to provide optimization capabilities in areas such as manufacturing, industrial, transportation, finance, pharma, and materials. The startup says it has developed specialized software, along with its proprietary hardware, to support real-world quantum applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Quantum can really make sure AI is robust,” said QpiAI founder and CEO Nagendra Nagaraja in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup views simulation, drug synthesis, and material discovery as some of the key use cases where the combination of AI and quantum could provide a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because the design space of a quantum chip is very, very big, and to actually get optimal qubits, which is important when we integrate thousands of qubits to get logical qubits for error correction, AI plays a bigger role there,” Nagaraja told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;QpiAI plans to launch its 64-qubit quantum computer in November, with availability to customers expected by the second or third quarter of next year, Nagaraja said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also working to start manufacturing its quantum hardware locally in 2026. Currently, it assembles 80% of its machines in-house.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;QpiAI employs a 100-person team, comprising 25 PhDs from international institutions or from Indian institutes. About 50 of its employees are based in India. The company says it has around 20 customers in India and the U.S., including the Indian government, which uses its infrastructure to test algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to the company, QpiAI has been profitable at EBITDA level for the past three years, with approximately 60% gross margins and 20% to 30% net margins, Nagaraja told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the fresh funding, QpiAI plans to enter new markets including Singapore and the Middle East. It also aims to allocate funds for its local manufacturing plans and scale its operations to develop a 100-logical qubit system by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June of last year, QpiAI raised $6.5 million in a pre-Series A round led by YourNest and SVCL at a post-money valuation of around $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nagaraja told TechCrunch that QpiAI has a three- to four-year runway, even without accounting for its profitability. He also said the startup is considering an initial public offering in either 2026 or 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The National Quantum Mission’s support extends beyond QpiAI. The Indian government’s program is also backing startups such as QNu Labs (working on quantum-safe networks), Dimira Technologies (cryogenic cables), PrenishQ (diode-laser systems), and QuPrayog (optical atomic clocks). It has also supported Quanastra (cryogenic systems and superconducting detectors), Pristine Diamonds (diamond-based sensing materials), and Quan2D Technologies (single-photon detectors for quantum communication).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to continue to support home-grown product companies like QpiAI to help them expand into large enterprises and position India as global leaders in quantum technologies,” said Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of India’s National Quantum Mission, in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;QpiAI, an Indian startup that claims to integrate AI and quantum computing for enterprise use cases, has raised $32 million in a new funding round co-led by the Indian government as the company aims to expand its presence and develop utility-scale quantum computers for markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the fresh funding, QpiAI plans to enter new markets including Singapore and the Middle East. It also aims to allocate funds for its local manufacturing plans and scale its operations to develop a 100-logical qubit system by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June of last year, QpiAI raised $6.5 million in a pre-Series A round led by YourNest and SVCL at a post-money valuation of around $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nagaraja told TechCrunch that QpiAI has a three- to four-year runway, even without accounting for its profitability. He also said the startup is considering an initial public offering in either 2026 or 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The National Quantum Mission’s support extends beyond QpiAI. The Indian government’s program is also backing startups such as QNu Labs (working on quantum-safe networks), Dimira Technologies (cryogenic cables), PrenishQ (diode-laser systems), and QuPrayog (optical atomic clocks). It has also supported Quanastra (cryogenic systems and superconducting detectors), Pristine Diamonds (diamond-based sensing materials), and Quan2D Technologies (single-photon detectors for quantum communication).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to continue to support home-grown product companies like QpiAI to help them expand into large enterprises and position India as global leaders in quantum technologies,” said Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of India’s National Quantum Mission, in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 20:54:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can AI really code?

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3c70286d-7fff-a737-d9dc-ea0a5bb6f3af"&gt;Imagine a future where artificial intelligence quietly shoulders the drudgery of software development: refactoring tangled code, migrating legacy systems, and hunting down race conditions, so that human engineers can devote themselves to architecture, design, and the genuinely novel problems still beyond a machine’s reach. Recent advances appear to have nudged that future tantalizingly close, but a new paper by researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and several collaborating institutions argues that this potential future reality demands a hard look at present-day challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Titled “Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering,” the work maps the many software-engineering tasks beyond code generation, identifies current bottlenecks, and highlights research directions to overcome them, aiming to let humans focus on high-level design while routine work is automated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Everyone is talking about how we don’t need programmers anymore, and there’s all this automation now available,” says Armando Solar‑Lezama, MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science, CSAIL principal investigator, and senior author of the study. “On the one hand, the field has made tremendous progress. We have tools that are way more powerful than any we’ve seen before. But there’s also a long way to go toward really getting the full promise of automation that we would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Solar-Lezama argues that popular narratives often shrink software engineering to “the undergrad programming part: someone hands you a spec for a little function and you implement it, or solving LeetCode-style programming interviews.” Real practice is far broader. It includes everyday refactors that polish design, plus sweeping migrations that move millions of lines from COBOL to Java and reshape entire businesses. It requires nonstop testing and analysis — fuzzing, property-based testing, and other methods — to catch concurrency bugs, or patch zero-day flaws. And it involves the maintenance grind: documenting decade-old code, summarizing change histories for new teammates, and reviewing pull requests for style, performance, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Industry-scale code optimization — think re-tuning GPU kernels or the relentless, multi-layered refinements behind Chrome’s V8 engine — remains stubbornly hard to evaluate. Today’s headline metrics were designed for short, self-contained problems, and while multiple-choice tests still dominate natural-language research, they were never the norm in AI-for-code. The field’s de facto yardstick, SWE-Bench, simply asks a model to patch a GitHub issue: useful, but still akin to the “undergrad programming exercise” paradigm. It touches only a few hundred lines of code, risks data leakage from public repositories, and ignores other real-world contexts — AI-assisted refactors, human–AI pair programming, or performance-critical rewrites that span millions of lines. Until benchmarks expand to capture those higher-stakes scenarios, measuring progress — and thus accelerating it — will remain an open challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If measurement is one obstacle, human‑machine communication is another. First author Alex  Gu, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, sees today’s interaction as “a thin line of communication.” When he asks a system to generate code, he often receives a large, unstructured file and even a set of unit tests, yet those tests tend to be superficial. This gap extends to the AI’s ability to effectively use the wider suite of software engineering tools, from debuggers to static analyzers, that humans rely on for precise control and deeper understanding. “I don’t really have much control over what the model writes,” he says. “Without a channel for the AI to expose its own confidence — ‘this part’s correct … this part, maybe double‑check’ — developers risk blindly trusting hallucinated logic that compiles, but collapses in production. Another critical aspect is having the AI know when to defer to the user for clarification.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scale compounds these difficulties. Current AI models struggle profoundly with large code bases, often spanning millions of lines. Foundation models learn from public GitHub, but “every company’s code base is kind of different and unique,” Gu says, making proprietary coding conventions and specification requirements fundamentally out of distribution. The result is code that looks plausible yet calls non‑existent functions, violates internal style rules, or fails continuous‑integration pipelines. This often leads to AI-generated code that “hallucinates,” meaning it creates content that looks plausible but doesn’t align with the specific internal conventions, helper functions, or architectural patterns of a given company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Models will also often retrieve incorrectly, because it retrieves code with a similar name (syntax) rather than functionality and logic, which is what a model might need to know how to write the function. “Standard retrieval techniques are very easily fooled by pieces of code that are doing the same thing but look different,” says Solar‑Lezama.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The authors mention that since there is no silver bullet to these issues, they’re calling instead for community‑scale efforts: richer, having data that captures the process of developers writing code (for example, which code developers keep versus throw away, how code gets refactored over time, etc.), shared evaluation suites that measure progress on refactor quality, bug‑fix longevity, and migration correctness; and transparent tooling that lets models expose uncertainty and invite human steering rather than passive acceptance. Gu frames the agenda as a “call to action” for larger open‑source collaborations that no single lab could muster alone. Solar‑Lezama imagines incremental advances—“research results taking bites out of each one of these challenges separately”—that feed back into commercial tools and gradually move AI from autocomplete sidekick toward genuine engineering partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Why does any of this matter? Software already underpins finance, transportation, health care, and the minutiae of daily life, and the human effort required to build and maintain it safely is becoming a bottleneck. An AI that can shoulder the grunt work — and do so without introducing hidden failures — would free developers to focus on creativity, strategy, and ethics” says Gu. “But that future depends on acknowledging that code completion is the easy part; the hard part is everything else. Our goal isn’t to replace programmers. It’s to amplify them. When AI can tackle the tedious and the terrifying, human engineers can finally spend their time on what only humans can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“With so many new works emerging in AI for coding, and the community often chasing the latest trends, it can be hard to step back and reflect on which problems are most important to tackle,” says Baptiste Rozière, an AI scientist at Mistral AI, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “I enjoyed reading this paper because it offers a clear overview of the key tasks and challenges in AI for software engineering. It also outlines promising directions for future research in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gu and Solar-Lezama wrote the paper with University of California at Berkeley Professor Koushik Sen and PhD students Naman Jain and Manish Shetty, Cornell University Assistant Professor Kevin Ellis and PhD student Wen-Ding Li, Stanford University Assistant Professor Diyi Yang and PhD student Yijia Shao, and incoming Johns Hopkins University assistant professor Ziyang Li. Their work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF), SKY Lab industrial sponsors and affiliates, Intel Corp. through an NSF grant, and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are presenting their work at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The babies were born to mothers who carry genes for mitochondrial diseases and risked passing on severe disorders. The eight babies are healthy, say the researchers behind the trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Mitochondrial disease can have a devastating impact on families,” Doug Turnbull of Newcastle University, one of the researchers behind the study, said in a statement. “Today’s news offers fresh hope to many more women at risk of passing on this condition, who now have the chance to have children growing up without this terrible disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, which makes use of a technology called mitochondrial donation, has been described as a “tour de force” and “a remarkable accomplishment” by others in the field. In the team’s approach, patients’ eggs are fertilized with sperm, and the DNA-containing nuclei of those cells are transferred into donated fertilized eggs that have had their own nuclei removed. The new embryos contain the DNA of the intended parents along with a tiny fraction of mitochondrial DNA from the donor, floating in the embryos’ cytoplasm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The concept of [mitochondrial donation] has attracted much commentary and occasionally concern and anxiety,” Stuart Lavery, a consultant in reproductive medicine at University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said in a statement. “The Newcastle team have demonstrated that it can be used in a clinically effective and ethically acceptable way to prevent disease and suffering.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Not everyone sees the trial as a resounding success. While five of the children were born “with no health problems,” one developed a fever and a urinary tract infection, and another had muscle jerks. A third was treated for an abnormal heart rhythm. Three of the babies were born with a low level of the very mitochondrial-DNA mutations the treatment was designed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University, says she is “moderately optimistic.” “I’m happy that it worked,” she says. “But at the same time, it’s concerning … it’s a call for caution and treading carefully.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Pavlo Mazur, a former embryologist who has used a similar approach in the conception of 15 babies in Ukraine, believes that trials like this one should be paused until researchers figure out what’s going on. Others believe that researchers should study the technique in people who don’t have mitochondrial mutations, to lower the risk of passing any disease-causing mutations to children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long time coming&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news of the births has been long awaited by researchers in the field. Mitochondrial donation was first made legal in the UK in 2015. Two years later, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates fertility treatment and research in the UK, granted a fertility clinic in Newcastle the sole license to perform the procedure. Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life launched a trial of mitochondrial donation in 2017 with the aim of treating 25 women a year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was eight years ago. Since then, the Newcastle team have been extremely tight-lipped about the trial. That’s despite the fact that other teams elsewhere have used mitochondrial donation to help people achieve pregnancy. A New York–based doctor used a type of mitochondrial donation to help a Jordanian couple conceive in Mexico in 2016. Mitochondrial donation has also been trialed by teams in Ukraine and Greece.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as the only trial overseen by the HFEA, the Newcastle team’s study was viewed by many as the most “official.” Researchers have been itching to hear how the work has been going, given the potential implications for researchers elsewhere (mitochondrial donation was officially made legal in Australia in 2022). “I’m very glad to see [the results] come out at last,” says Dagan Wells, a reproductive biologist at the University of Oxford who worked on the Greece trial. “It would have been nice to have some information out along the way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Newcastle clinic, each patient must receive approval from the HFEA to be eligible for mitochondrial donation. Since the trial launched in 2017, 39 patients have won this approval. Twenty-five of them underwent hormonal stimulation to release multiple eggs that could be frozen in storage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nineteen of those women went on to have mitochondrial donation. So far, seven of the women have given birth (one had twins), and an eighth is still pregnant. The oldest baby is two years old. The results were published today in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life,” one of the mothers, who is remaining anonymous, said in a statement. “Mitochondrial donation IVF made that possible. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope—and then it gave us our baby … Science gave us a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When each baby was born, the team collected a blood and urine sample to look at the child’s mitochondrial DNA. They found that the levels of mutated DNA were far lower than they would have expected without mitochondrial donation. Three of the mothers were “homoplasmic”—100% of their mitochondrial DNA carried the mutation. But blood tests showed that in the women’s four babies (including the twins), 5% or less of the mitochondrial DNA had the mutation, suggesting they won’t develop disease.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A mixed result&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers see this as a positive result. “Children who would otherwise have inherited very high levels are now inheriting levels that are reduced by 77% to 100%,” coauthor Mary Herbert, a professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and Monash University, told me during a press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But three of the eight babies had health symptoms. At seven months, one was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy, which seemed to resolve within the following three months. Another baby developed a urinary tract infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A third baby developed “prolonged” jaundice, high levels of fat in the blood, and a disturbed heart rhythm that required treatment. The baby seemed to have recovered by 18 months, and doctors believe that the symptoms were not related to the mitochondrial mutations, but the team members admit that they can’t be sure. Given the small sample size, it’s hard to make comparisons with babies conceived in other ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they acknowledge that a phenomenon called “reversal” is happening in some of the babies. In theory, the children shouldn’t inherit any “bad” mitochondrial DNA from their mothers. But three of them did. The levels of “bad” mitochondrial DNA in the babies’ blood ranged between 5% and 16%. And they were higher in the babies’ urine—the highest figure being 20%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t know why this is happening. When an embryologist pulls out the nucleus of a fertilized egg, a bit of mitochondria-containing cytoplasm will inevitably be dragged along with it. But the team didn’t see any link between the amount of carried-over cytoplasm and the level of “bad” mitochondria. “We continue to investigate this issue,” Herbert said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As long as they don’t understand what’s happening, I would still be worried,” says Mertes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such low levels aren’t likely to cause mitochondrial diseases, according to experts contacted by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. But some are concerned that the percentage of mutated DNA could be higher in different tissues, such as the brain or muscle, or that the levels might change with age. “You never know which tissues [reversal] will show up in,” says Mazur, who has seen the phenomenon in babies born through mitochondrial donation to parents who didn’t have mitochondrial mutations. “It’s chaotic.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Newcastle team says it hasn’t looked at other tissues, because it designed the study to be noninvasive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There has been at least one case in which similar levels of “bad” mitochondria have caused symptoms, says Joanna Poulton, a mitochondrial geneticist at the University of Oxford. She thinks it’s unlikely that the children in the trial will develop any symptoms but adds that “it’s a bit of a worry.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The age of reversal&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly when this reversal happens. But Wells and his colleagues have some idea. In their study in Greece, they looked at the mitochondrial DNA of embryos and checked them again during pregnancy and after birth. The trial was designed to study the impact of mitochondrial donation for infertility—none of the parents involved had genes for mitochondrial disease.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The team has seen mitochondrial reversal in two of the seven babies born in the trial, says Wells. If you put the two sets of results together, mitochondrial donation “seems to have this possibility of reversal occurring in maybe about a third of children,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his study, the reversal seemed to occur early on in the embryos’ development, Wells says. Five-day-old embryos “look perfect,” but mitochondrial mutations start showing up in tests taken at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, he says. After that point, the levels appear to be relatively stable. The Newcastle researchers say they will monitor the children until they are five years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People enrolling in future trials might opt for amniocentesis, which involves sampling blood from the fetus’s amniotic sac at around 15 to 18 weeks, suggests Mertes. That test might reveal the likely level of mitochondrial mutations in the resulting child. “Then the parents could decide what to do,” says Mertes. “If you could see there was a 90% mutation load [for a] very serious mitochondrial disease, they would still have an option to cancel the pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wells thinks the Newcastle team’s results are “generally reassuring.” He doesn’t think the trials should be paused. But he wants people to understand that mitochondrial donation is not without risk. “This can only be viewed as a risk reduction strategy, and not a guarantee of having an unaffected child,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, as Mertes points out, there’s another option for women who carry mitochondrial DNA mutations: egg donation. Donor eggs fertilized with a partner’s sperm and transferred to a woman’s uterus won’t have her disease-causing mitochondria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That option won’t appeal to people who feel strongly about having a genetic link to their children. But Poulton asks: “If you know whose uterus you came out of, does it matter that the [egg] came from somewhere else?”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-172594620_1.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eight babies have been born in the UK thanks to a technology that uses DNA from three people: the two biological parents plus a third person who supplies healthy mitochondrial DNA. The babies were born to mothers who carry genes for mitochondrial diseases and risked passing on severe disorders. The eight babies are healthy, say the researchers behind the trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Mitochondrial disease can have a devastating impact on families,” Doug Turnbull of Newcastle University, one of the researchers behind the study, said in a statement. “Today’s news offers fresh hope to many more women at risk of passing on this condition, who now have the chance to have children growing up without this terrible disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, which makes use of a technology called mitochondrial donation, has been described as a “tour de force” and “a remarkable accomplishment” by others in the field. In the team’s approach, patients’ eggs are fertilized with sperm, and the DNA-containing nuclei of those cells are transferred into donated fertilized eggs that have had their own nuclei removed. The new embryos contain the DNA of the intended parents along with a tiny fraction of mitochondrial DNA from the donor, floating in the embryos’ cytoplasm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The concept of [mitochondrial donation] has attracted much commentary and occasionally concern and anxiety,” Stuart Lavery, a consultant in reproductive medicine at University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said in a statement. “The Newcastle team have demonstrated that it can be used in a clinically effective and ethically acceptable way to prevent disease and suffering.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Not everyone sees the trial as a resounding success. While five of the children were born “with no health problems,” one developed a fever and a urinary tract infection, and another had muscle jerks. A third was treated for an abnormal heart rhythm. Three of the babies were born with a low level of the very mitochondrial-DNA mutations the treatment was designed to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University, says she is “moderately optimistic.” “I’m happy that it worked,” she says. “But at the same time, it’s concerning … it’s a call for caution and treading carefully.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Pavlo Mazur, a former embryologist who has used a similar approach in the conception of 15 babies in Ukraine, believes that trials like this one should be paused until researchers figure out what’s going on. Others believe that researchers should study the technique in people who don’t have mitochondrial mutations, to lower the risk of passing any disease-causing mutations to children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long time coming&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news of the births has been long awaited by researchers in the field. Mitochondrial donation was first made legal in the UK in 2015. Two years later, the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates fertility treatment and research in the UK, granted a fertility clinic in Newcastle the sole license to perform the procedure. Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life launched a trial of mitochondrial donation in 2017 with the aim of treating 25 women a year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was eight years ago. Since then, the Newcastle team have been extremely tight-lipped about the trial. That’s despite the fact that other teams elsewhere have used mitochondrial donation to help people achieve pregnancy. A New York–based doctor used a type of mitochondrial donation to help a Jordanian couple conceive in Mexico in 2016. Mitochondrial donation has also been trialed by teams in Ukraine and Greece.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as the only trial overseen by the HFEA, the Newcastle team’s study was viewed by many as the most “official.” Researchers have been itching to hear how the work has been going, given the potential implications for researchers elsewhere (mitochondrial donation was officially made legal in Australia in 2022). “I’m very glad to see [the results] come out at last,” says Dagan Wells, a reproductive biologist at the University of Oxford who worked on the Greece trial. “It would have been nice to have some information out along the way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Newcastle clinic, each patient must receive approval from the HFEA to be eligible for mitochondrial donation. Since the trial launched in 2017, 39 patients have won this approval. Twenty-five of them underwent hormonal stimulation to release multiple eggs that could be frozen in storage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nineteen of those women went on to have mitochondrial donation. So far, seven of the women have given birth (one had twins), and an eighth is still pregnant. The oldest baby is two years old. The results were published today in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life,” one of the mothers, who is remaining anonymous, said in a statement. “Mitochondrial donation IVF made that possible. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope—and then it gave us our baby … Science gave us a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When each baby was born, the team collected a blood and urine sample to look at the child’s mitochondrial DNA. They found that the levels of mutated DNA were far lower than they would have expected without mitochondrial donation. Three of the mothers were “homoplasmic”—100% of their mitochondrial DNA carried the mutation. But blood tests showed that in the women’s four babies (including the twins), 5% or less of the mitochondrial DNA had the mutation, suggesting they won’t develop disease.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A mixed result&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers see this as a positive result. “Children who would otherwise have inherited very high levels are now inheriting levels that are reduced by 77% to 100%,” coauthor Mary Herbert, a professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and Monash University, told me during a press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But three of the eight babies had health symptoms. At seven months, one was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy, which seemed to resolve within the following three months. Another baby developed a urinary tract infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A third baby developed “prolonged” jaundice, high levels of fat in the blood, and a disturbed heart rhythm that required treatment. The baby seemed to have recovered by 18 months, and doctors believe that the symptoms were not related to the mitochondrial mutations, but the team members admit that they can’t be sure. Given the small sample size, it’s hard to make comparisons with babies conceived in other ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they acknowledge that a phenomenon called “reversal” is happening in some of the babies. In theory, the children shouldn’t inherit any “bad” mitochondrial DNA from their mothers. But three of them did. The levels of “bad” mitochondrial DNA in the babies’ blood ranged between 5% and 16%. And they were higher in the babies’ urine—the highest figure being 20%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t know why this is happening. When an embryologist pulls out the nucleus of a fertilized egg, a bit of mitochondria-containing cytoplasm will inevitably be dragged along with it. But the team didn’t see any link between the amount of carried-over cytoplasm and the level of “bad” mitochondria. “We continue to investigate this issue,” Herbert said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As long as they don’t understand what’s happening, I would still be worried,” says Mertes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such low levels aren’t likely to cause mitochondrial diseases, according to experts contacted by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. But some are concerned that the percentage of mutated DNA could be higher in different tissues, such as the brain or muscle, or that the levels might change with age. “You never know which tissues [reversal] will show up in,” says Mazur, who has seen the phenomenon in babies born through mitochondrial donation to parents who didn’t have mitochondrial mutations. “It’s chaotic.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Newcastle team says it hasn’t looked at other tissues, because it designed the study to be noninvasive.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There has been at least one case in which similar levels of “bad” mitochondria have caused symptoms, says Joanna Poulton, a mitochondrial geneticist at the University of Oxford. She thinks it’s unlikely that the children in the trial will develop any symptoms but adds that “it’s a bit of a worry.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The age of reversal&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly when this reversal happens. But Wells and his colleagues have some idea. In their study in Greece, they looked at the mitochondrial DNA of embryos and checked them again during pregnancy and after birth. The trial was designed to study the impact of mitochondrial donation for infertility—none of the parents involved had genes for mitochondrial disease.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The team has seen mitochondrial reversal in two of the seven babies born in the trial, says Wells. If you put the two sets of results together, mitochondrial donation “seems to have this possibility of reversal occurring in maybe about a third of children,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his study, the reversal seemed to occur early on in the embryos’ development, Wells says. Five-day-old embryos “look perfect,” but mitochondrial mutations start showing up in tests taken at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, he says. After that point, the levels appear to be relatively stable. The Newcastle researchers say they will monitor the children until they are five years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People enrolling in future trials might opt for amniocentesis, which involves sampling blood from the fetus’s amniotic sac at around 15 to 18 weeks, suggests Mertes. That test might reveal the likely level of mitochondrial mutations in the resulting child. “Then the parents could decide what to do,” says Mertes. “If you could see there was a 90% mutation load [for a] very serious mitochondrial disease, they would still have an option to cancel the pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wells thinks the Newcastle team’s results are “generally reassuring.” He doesn’t think the trials should be paused. But he wants people to understand that mitochondrial donation is not without risk. “This can only be viewed as a risk reduction strategy, and not a guarantee of having an unaffected child,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, as Mertes points out, there’s another option for women who carry mitochondrial DNA mutations: egg donation.

            &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) excel at using textual reasoning to understand the context of a document and provide a logical answer about its contents. But these same LLMs often struggle to correctly answer even the simplest math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textual reasoning is usually a less-than-ideal way to deliberate over computational or algorithmic tasks. While some LLMs can generate code like Python to handle symbolic queries, the models don’t always know when to use code, or what kind of code would work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs, it seems, may need a coach to steer them toward the best technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter CodeSteer, a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeSteer, itself a smaller LLM, automatically generates a series of prompts to iteratively steer a larger LLM. It reviews the model’s current and previous answers after each round and provides guidance for how it can fix or refine that solution until it deems the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that augmenting a larger LLM with CodeSteer boosted its accuracy on symbolic tasks, like multiplying numbers, playing Sudoku, and stacking blocks, by more than 30 percent. It also enabled less sophisticated models to outperform more advanced models with enhanced reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advance could improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks that are especially difficult to solve with textual reasoning alone, such as generating paths for robots in uncertain environments or scheduling shipments in an international supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a race to develop better and better models that are capable of doing everything, but we’ve taken a complementary approach. Researchers have spent years developing effective technologies and tools to tackle problems in many domains. We want to enable LLMs to select the right tools and methods, and make use of others’ expertise to enhance their own capabilities,” says Chuchu Fan, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics (AeroAstro) and principal investigator in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan, the senior author of the study, is joined on a paper about the work by LIDS graduate student Yongchao Chen; AeroAstro graduate student Yilun Hao; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student Yueying Liu; and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab Research Scientist Yang Zhang. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An LLM “trainer”&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask an LLM which number is bigger, 9.11 or 9.9, and it will often give the wrong answer by using textual reasoning. But ask it to use code to answer the same question, and it can generate and execute a Python script to compare the two numbers, easily solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially trained to understand and predict human language, LLMs are more likely to answer queries using text, even when code would be more effective. And while they have learned to generate code through fine-tuning, these models often generate an incorrect or less efficient version of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to retrain a powerful LLM like GPT-4 or Claude to improve these capabilities, the MIT researchers fine-tune a smaller, lightweight LLM to guide a larger model between text and code. Fine-tuning a smaller model doesn’t change the larger LLM, so there is no risk it would undermine the larger model’s other abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also inspired by humans. In sports, a trainer may not be better than the star athlete on the team, but the trainer can still give helpful suggestions to guide the athlete. This steering method works for LLMs, too,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trainer, CodeSteer, works in conjunction with the larger LLM. It first reviews a query and determines whether text or code is suitable for this problem, and which sort of code would be best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it generates a prompt for the larger LLM, telling it to use a coding method or textual reasoning to answer the query. The larger model follows this prompt to answer the query and sends the result back to CodeSteer, which reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is not correct, CodeSteer will continue prompting the LLM to try different things that might fix the problem, such as incorporating a search algorithm or constraint into its Python code, until the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that oftentimes, the larger LLM will try to be lazy and use a shorter, less efficient code that will not carry the correct symbolic calculation. We’ve designed CodeSteer to avoid this phenomenon,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbolic checker evaluates the code’s complexity and sends a signal to CodeSteer if it is too simple or inefficient. The researchers also incorporate a self-answer checker into CodeSteer, which prompts the LLM to generate code that calculates the answer to verify it is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling complex tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers designed CodeSteer, they couldn’t find suitable symbolic datasets to fine-tune and test the model, since many existing benchmarks don’t point out whether a certain query could be best solved with text or code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, they gathered a corpus of 37 complex symbolic tasks, including spatial reasoning, mathematics, order reasoning, and optimization, and built their own dataset, called SymBench. They implemented a fine-tuning approach that leverages SymBench to maximize the performance of CodeSteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, CodeSteer outperformed all nine baseline methods they evaluated and boosted average accuracy from 53.3 percent to 86.4 percent. It maintains similar performance even on unseen tasks, and on a variety of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a general-purpose model augmented with CodeSteer can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models designed to focus on complex reasoning and planning, while requiring much less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method uses an LLM’s own capabilities. By augmenting an LLM with the ability to smartly use coding, we can take a model that is already very strong and improve its performance even more,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to streamline CodeSteer to speed up its iterative prompting process. In addition, they are studying how to effectively fine-tune a unified model with the ability to switch between textual reasoning and code generation, rather than relying on a separate assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors present an elegant solution to the critical challenge of tool utilization in LLMs. This simple yet impactful method enables state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve significant performance improvements without requiring direct fine-tuning,” says Jinsung Yoon, a staff research scientist at Google Cloud AI, who was not involved with this work. “This research represents a substantial contribution that promises to significantly enhance the application of LLMs to a diverse range of tasks with which they currently struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their success in training a smaller, specialized model to strategically guide larger, advanced models is particularly impactful,” adds Chi Wang, a senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind who was not involved with this work. “This intelligent collaboration among diverse AI ‘agents’ paves the way for more robust and versatile applications in complex real-world scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

It maintains similar performance even on unseen tasks, and on a variety of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a general-purpose model augmented with CodeSteer can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models designed to focus on complex reasoning and planning, while requiring much less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method uses an LLM’s own capabilities. By augmenting an LLM with the ability to smartly use coding, we can take a model that is already very strong and improve its performance even more,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to streamline CodeSteer to speed up its iterative prompting process. In addition, they are studying how to effectively fine-tune a unified model with the ability to switch between textual reasoning and code generation, rather than relying on a separate assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors present an elegant solution to the critical challenge of tool utilization in LLMs. This simple yet impactful method enables state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve significant performance improvements without requiring direct fine-tuning,” says Jinsung Yoon, a staff research scientist at Google Cloud AI, who was not involved with this work. “This research represents a substantial contribution that promises to significantly enhance the application of LLMs to a diverse range of tasks with which they currently struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their success in training a smaller, specialized model to strategically guide larger, advanced models is particularly impactful,” adds Chi Wang, a senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind who was not involved with this work. “This intelligent collaboration among diverse AI ‘agents’ paves the way for more robust and versatile applications in complex real-world scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
