Wastewater tracking could help.

Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; has measles, &lt;em&gt;where &lt;/em&gt;exactly infections are occurring, or even &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents &amp;amp; Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/runaway-train.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws.

Defensive AI is emerging as a practical response, combining machine learning with human oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity rarely fails because teams lack tools. It fails because threats move faster than detection can keep pace. As digital systems expand, attackers adapt in real time while static defences fall behind.

Models learn by observing how users and applications interact. When activity breaks from expected patterns, alerts surface. This approach works even when the threat has never appeared before. Zero-day attacks really become visible because behaviour, not history, triggers concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common detection techniques include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioural base-lining to spot unusual activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anomaly detection in network and application traffic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Classification models trained on diverse threat patterns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time analysis is essential. Modern attacks spread quickly in interconnected systems. Machine learning continuously evaluates streaming data, letting security teams react before damage escalates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability proves especially valuable in cloud environments. Resources change constantly. Traditional perimeter defences lose relevance.

High-risk configuration items and exposed services are identified before deployment to production. That makes them less exposed in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once systems go live, monitoring shifts to runtime behaviour. Access requests, inference activity and data flows receive constant attention. Unusual patterns prompt investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-deployment oversight remains critical.

Isolated alerts become connected stories. Security teams gain context instead of noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning also helps prioritise risk. Not every alert requires immediate action. By scoring threats based on behaviour and impact, AI reduces alert fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prioritisation improves efficiency. Analysts spend time where it matters most.

It can become an assured means of protecting contemporary digital infrastructure, facilitating stable security operations that don’t diminish responsibility or decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/defensive-ai-and-how-machine-learning-strengthens-cyber-defense/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:15:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The Download: chatbots for health, and US fights over AI regulation (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/23/1131708/the-download-chatbots-for-health-and-us-fights-over-ai-regulation/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month.

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America’s coming war over AI regulation&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead.&amp;nbsp;Read our story about what’s on the horizon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Michelle Kim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story is from MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series of stories that look across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future.

Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading.

The report contains the company’s analysis of a million consumer interactions on Claude.ai, plus a million enterprise API calls, all dated from November 2025. The report notes that its figures are based on observations, rather than, for example, a sample of business decision-makers or generic survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limited-use-cases-dominate"&gt;Limited use cases dominate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Anthropic’s AI tends to cluster around a relatively small number of tasks, with the ten most frequently-performed tasks accounting for almost a quarter of consumer interactions, and nearly a third of enterprise API traffic. There’s a focus on the use of Claude for code creation and modification, as readers might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concentration of use of AI as a software development tool has remained fairly constant over time, suggesting that the model’s value is largely based around these types of tasks, with no emerging use of Claude for other purposes of any empirical significance. This suggests that broad, general rollouts of AI are less likely to be successful than those focused on tasks where large language models are proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-augmentation-outperforms-automation"&gt;Augmentation outperforms automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On consumer platforms, collaborative use – where users iterate on queries to the AI over the course of a virtual conversation – is more common than using the AI to produce automated workflows. Enterprise API usage shows the opposite, as businesses attempt to gain savings through automating tasks. However, while Claude succeeds on shorter tasks, the observed quality of outcomes declines the more complex the task (or series of tasks) is, and the longer the required ‘thinking time’ required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies automation is most effective for routine, well-defined tasks that are simpler, require fewer logical steps, and where responses to queries can be quick. Tasks estimated to take humans several hours show significantly lower completion rates than shorter tasks. For longer tasks to succeed, users have to iterate and correct outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users breaking down large tasks into manageable steps and posing each separately (either interactively or via API) have improved success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s observations show most queries put to the LLMs are associated with white-collar roles (although poorer countries tend to use Claude in academic settings more commonly than, for instance, the US).

The report contains the company’s analysis of a million consumer interactions on Claude.ai, plus a million enterprise API calls, all dated from November 2025. The report notes that its figures are based on observations, rather than, for example, a sample of business decision-makers or generic survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limited-use-cases-dominate"&gt;Limited use cases dominate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Anthropic’s AI tends to cluster around a relatively small number of tasks, with the ten most frequently-performed tasks accounting for almost a quarter of consumer interactions, and nearly a third of enterprise API traffic. There’s a focus on the use of Claude for code creation and modification, as readers might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concentration of use of AI as a software development tool has remained fairly constant over time, suggesting that the model’s value is largely based around these types of tasks, with no emerging use of Claude for other purposes of any empirical significance. This suggests that broad, general rollouts of AI are less likely to be successful than those focused on tasks where large language models are proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-augmentation-outperforms-automation"&gt;Augmentation outperforms automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On consumer platforms, collaborative use – where users iterate on queries to the AI over the course of a virtual conversation – is more common than using the AI to produce automated workflows. Enterprise API usage shows the opposite, as businesses attempt to gain savings through automating tasks. However, while Claude succeeds on shorter tasks, the observed quality of outcomes declines the more complex the task (or series of tasks) is, and the longer the required ‘thinking time’ required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies automation is most effective for routine, well-defined tasks that are simpler, require fewer logical steps, and where responses to queries can be quick. Tasks estimated to take humans several hours show significantly lower completion rates than shorter tasks. For longer tasks to succeed, users have to iterate and correct outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users breaking down large tasks into manageable steps and posing each separately (either interactively or via API) have improved success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s observations show most queries put to the LLMs are associated with white-collar roles (although poorer countries tend to use Claude in academic settings more commonly than, for instance, the US).

The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit’s website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers’ day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India’s enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trip would mark Altman’s first visit to India in nearly a year, after he traveled to the country in February 2025. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI’s August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit also comes as India has emerged as a key growth market for American AI companies. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. India has emerged as ChatGPT’s biggest market by downloads and second largest by users. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT’s enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced multibillion-dollar investments in India to expand their AI and cloud footprint. But India’s data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the Indian government is hopeful that the upcoming summit will cement India’s status as a destination for large-scale AI investment. The country’s IT minister said in a recent interview that the event could help attract as much as $100 billion in investment. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to build smaller models for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, India’s IT ministry, and the AI summit’s organizers did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198379368.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to visit India in mid-February, his first visit to the country in nearly a year, TechCrunch has learned. The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit’s website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers’ day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India’s enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trip would mark Altman’s first visit to India in nearly a year, after he traveled to the country in February 2025. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI’s August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit also comes as India has emerged as a key growth market for American AI companies. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. India has emerged as ChatGPT’s biggest market by downloads and second largest by users. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT’s enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced multibillion-dollar investments in India to expand their AI and cloud footprint. But India’s data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;

The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has been cracking down on teens’ access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3059397" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meta-AI-Controls_Visual2-1.jpeg?w=383" width="383" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta’s previously previewed controls around AI characters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user’s age to apply content restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches.

On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time.

                &lt;h3 class="class"&gt;2. Approximating the independent set&lt;/h3&gt;
            
        
        
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;GIST then looks for the maximum-utility subset that can be chosen where no two points are connected in this graph: the classic maximum independent set problem. Imagine planning a dinner party where certain guests can’t sit together. Your goal is to invite the most interesting group of people possible, but you must follow one rule: no two people at the table can have a conflict. This is a massive puzzle because picking one guest might "block" you from inviting three other high-interest people. To find the best combination, you have to check an exponential number of groupings, which is why it is considered one of the hardest problems in computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the max independent set problem itself is NP-complete (meaning that it’s widely believed there does not exist an efficient algorithm to find the absolute “perfect” answer for a massive dataset) and admits no reasonable approximation algorithm, GIST uses a carefully constructed bicriteria greedy algorithm to approximate the solution efficiently. It iterates through many possible distance thresholds, solving the corresponding independent set problem and ultimately selecting the best solution found across all thresholds.

    &lt;p&gt;GIST then looks for the maximum-utility subset that can be chosen where no two points are connected in this graph: the classic maximum independent set problem. Imagine planning a dinner party where certain guests can’t sit together. Your goal is to invite the most interesting group of people possible, but you must follow one rule: no two people at the table can have a conflict. This is a massive puzzle because picking one guest might "block" you from inviting three other high-interest people. To find the best combination, you have to check an exponential number of groupings, which is why it is considered one of the hardest problems in computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the max independent set problem itself is NP-complete (meaning that it’s widely believed there does not exist an efficient algorithm to find the absolute “perfect” answer for a massive dataset) and admits no reasonable approximation algorithm, GIST uses a carefully constructed bicriteria greedy algorithm to approximate the solution efficiently.
