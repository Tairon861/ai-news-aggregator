But it also doesn’t want the U.S.’s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s quite the balance to strike.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If President Trump’s AI Action Plan, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“​​America currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,” the plan stated. “It is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through “creative approaches” followed by a pair of policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn’t a focus on many of the component subsystems — a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“America must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,” the plan states. “We should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there’s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months —&amp;nbsp;including just last week.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD, the green light to start selling AI chips they had developed for China, just months after rolling out licensing restrictions on the same AI chips that effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration’s AI diffusion rule (which put a cap on how much&amp;nbsp;AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it’s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1246479507.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Trump administration wants its AI technology to be considered an industry leader both on home soil and abroad.

          &lt;p&gt;Google is following through on recent promises to add more generative AI features to its photo and video products. Over on YouTube, Google is rolling out the first wave of generative AI video for YouTube Shorts, but even if you're not a YouTuber, you'll be exposed to more AI videos soon. Google Photos, which is integrated with virtually every Android phone on the market, is also getting AI video-generation capabilities. In both cases, the features are currently based on the older Veo 2 model, not the more capable Veo 3 that has been meming across the Internet since it was announced at I/O in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube CEO Neal Mohan confirmed earlier this summer that the company planned to add generative AI to the creator tools for YouTube Shorts. There were already tools to generate backgrounds for videos, but the next phase will involve creating new video elements from a text prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, creators will be able to use a photo as the basis for a new generative AI video. YouTube also promises a collection of easily applied generative effects, which will be accessible from the Shorts camera. There's also a new AI playground hub that the company says will be home to all its AI tools, along with examples and suggested prompts to help people pump out AI content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1920" id="video-2107623-1" preload="metadata" width="1080"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aquatic_Joseph_Street_V01.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;The Veo 2-based videos aren't as realistic as Veo 3 clips, but an upgrade is planned.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      The Veo 2-based videos aren't as realistic as Veo 3 clips, but an upgrade is planned.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all the YouTube AI video features are running on the Veo 2 model. The plan is still to move to Veo 3 later this summer. The AI features in YouTube Shorts are currently limited to the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but they will expand to more countries later.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The new generative AI features in Google Photos are more limited in scale. Starting today, Photos users in the US only will begin seeing a similar set of features. Like YouTube, the app is gaining the ability to turn your photos into short videos, again, based on the older Veo 2 model. There are only two options for these animations: "Subtle movements" or "I'm feeling lucky." In the next few weeks, Photos will also get "Remix," a collection of styles that can be quickly chosen and applied to one of your images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2107623-2" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/UI_Walkthrough_Phototovideo_16x9_v12.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Photo to video capabilities are coming to Google Photos.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Photo to video capabilities are coming to Google Photos.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where YouTube Shorts is getting the AI playground, Photos is getting the Create tab. It will serve a similar function, listing all the generative AI tools in the app, and it's going to make them harder to ignore, as it will get a prominent place in the bottom navigation bar. The Create tab will begin rolling out in August, and it's also US-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is also taking this opportunity to again stress that it uses its SynthID digital watermarking technology on all AI-generated images and videos. That theoretically makes it harder to pass off AI content as authentic. That may not be a big concern with videos based on Veo 2, but we've seen how much better Veo 3 is. Google also notes that it conducts ongoing safety analysis to prevent misuse of its AI video models, but that doesn't always stop determined trolls.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google is following through on recent promises to add more generative AI features to its photo and video products. Over on YouTube, Google is rolling out the first wave of generative AI video for YouTube Shorts, but even if you're not a YouTuber, you'll be exposed to more AI videos soon. Google Photos, which is integrated with virtually every Android phone on the market, is also getting AI video-generation capabilities. In both cases, the features are currently based on the older Veo 2 model, not the more capable Veo 3 that has been meming across the Internet since it was announced at I/O in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube CEO Neal Mohan confirmed earlier this summer that the company planned to add generative AI to the creator tools for YouTube Shorts. There were already tools to generate backgrounds for videos, but the next phase will involve creating new video elements from a text prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, creators will be able to use a photo as the basis for a new generative AI video. YouTube also promises a collection of easily applied generative effects, which will be accessible from the Shorts camera. There's also a new AI playground hub that the company says will be home to all its AI tools, along with examples and suggested prompts to help people pump out AI content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all the YouTube AI video features are running on the Veo 2 model. The plan is still to move to Veo 3 later this summer. The AI features in YouTube Shorts are currently limited to the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but they will expand to more countries later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generative AI features in Google Photos are more limited in scale. Starting today, Photos users in the US only will begin seeing a similar set of features. Like YouTube, the app is gaining the ability to turn your photos into short videos, again, based on the older Veo 2 model. There are only two options for these animations: "Subtle movements" or "I'm feeling lucky." In the next few weeks, Photos will also get "Remix," a collection of styles that can be quickly chosen and applied to one of your images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2107623-2" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/UI_Walkthrough_Phototovideo_16x9_v12.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Photo to video capabilities are coming to Google Photos.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Photo to video capabilities are coming to Google Photos.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where YouTube Shorts is getting the AI playground, Photos is getting the Create tab. It will serve a similar function, listing all the generative AI tools in the app, and it's going to make them harder to ignore, as it will get a prominent place in the bottom navigation bar. The Create tab will begin rolling out in August, and it's also US-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is also taking this opportunity to again stress that it uses its SynthID digital watermarking technology on all AI-generated images and videos. That theoretically makes it harder to pass off AI content as authentic. That may not be a big concern with videos based on Veo 2, but we've seen how much better Veo 3 is. Google also notes that it conducts ongoing safety analysis to prevent misuse of its AI video models, but that doesn't always stop determined trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced a partnership with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional data center capacity for its Stargate AI infrastructure platform in the US. The expansion, which TechCrunch reports is part of a $30 billion per year deal between OpenAI and Oracle, will reportedly bring OpenAI's total Stargate capacity under development to over 5 gigawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data center has taken root in Abilene, Texas, a city of 127,000 located 150 miles west of Fort Worth. The city, which serves as the commercial hub of a 19-county region known as the "Big Country," offers a location with existing tech infrastructure, including Dyess Air Force Base and three universities. Abilene's economy has evolved over time from its agricultural and livestock roots to embrace technology and manufacturing sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have signed a deal for an additional 4.5 gigawatts of capacity with oracle as part of stargate. easy to throw around numbers, but this is a gigantic infrastructure project," wrote OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X. "We are planning to significantly expand the ambitions of stargate past the $500 billion commitment we announced in January."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new agreement builds on OpenAI's initial $500 billion commitment announced at the White House in January to invest in 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure over four years. The company estimates that the 4.5 GW expansion will generate jobs across construction and operations roles, including direct full-time positions, short-term construction work, and indirect manufacturing and service jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 gigawatts of total capacity refers to the amount of electrical power these data centers will consume when fully operational—enough to power roughly 4.4 million American homes. It turns out that telling users their every idea is brilliant requires a lot of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stargate moves forward despite early skepticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When OpenAI announced Stargate in January, critics questioned whether the company could deliver on its ambitious $500 billion funding promise. Trump ally and frequent Altman foe Elon Musk wrote on X that "They don't actually have the money," claiming that "SoftBank has well under $10B secured."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech writer and frequent OpenAI critic Ed Zitron raised concerns about OpenAI's financial position, noting the company's $5 billion in losses in 2024. "This company loses $5bn+ a year! So what, they raise $19bn for Stargate, then what, another $10bn just to be able to survive?" Zitron wrote on Bluesky at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, OpenAI's Abilene data center has moved from construction to partial operation. Oracle began delivering Nvidia GB200 racks to the facility last month, and OpenAI reports it has started running early training and inference workloads to support what it calls "next-generation frontier research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the White House announcement with President Trump in January, the Stargate concept dates back to March 2024, when Microsoft and OpenAI jointly planned a $100 billion supercomputer as part of a five-phase plan. Over time, the plan evolved into its current form as a partnership with Oracle, SoftBank, and CoreWeave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stargate is an ambitious undertaking designed to meet the historic opportunity in front of us," writes OpenAI in the press release announcing the latest deal. "That opportunity is now coming to life through strong support from partners, governments, and investors worldwide—including important leadership from the White House, which has recognized the critical role AI infrastructure will play in driving innovation, economic growth, and national competitiveness."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5 gigawatts of total capacity refers to the amount of electrical power these data centers will consume when fully operational—enough to power roughly 4.4 million American homes. It turns out that telling users their every idea is brilliant requires a lot of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stargate moves forward despite early skepticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When OpenAI announced Stargate in January, critics questioned whether the company could deliver on its ambitious $500 billion funding promise. Trump ally and frequent Altman foe Elon Musk wrote on X that "They don't actually have the money," claiming that "SoftBank has well under $10B secured."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech writer and frequent OpenAI critic Ed Zitron raised concerns about OpenAI's financial position, noting the company's $5 billion in losses in 2024. "This company loses $5bn+ a year! So what, they raise $19bn for Stargate, then what, another $10bn just to be able to survive?" Zitron wrote on Bluesky at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, OpenAI's Abilene data center has moved from construction to partial operation. Oracle began delivering Nvidia GB200 racks to the facility last month, and OpenAI reports it has started running early training and inference workloads to support what it calls "next-generation frontier research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the White House announcement with President Trump in January, the Stargate concept dates back to March 2024, when Microsoft and OpenAI jointly planned a $100 billion supercomputer as part of a five-phase plan. Over time, the plan evolved into its current form as a partnership with Oracle, SoftBank, and CoreWeave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stargate is an ambitious undertaking designed to meet the historic opportunity in front of us," writes OpenAI in the press release announcing the latest deal. "That opportunity is now coming to life through strong support from partners, governments, and investors worldwide—including important leadership from the White House, which has recognized the critical role AI infrastructure will play in driving innovation, economic growth, and national competitiveness."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  
          &lt;div class="-mx-2.5 sm:mx-0"&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s “Qwen Team” has done it again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mere days after releasing for free and with open source licensing what is now the top performing non-reasoning large language model (LLM) in the world — full stop, even compared to proprietary AI models from well-funded U.S. labs such as Google and OpenAI — in the form of the lengthily named Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, this group of AI researchers has come out with yet another blockbuster model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;strong&gt;Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct&lt;/strong&gt;, a new open-source LLM focused on assisting with software development. It is designed to handle complex, multi-step coding workflows and can create full-fledged, functional applications in &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt; or minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model is positioned to compete with proprietary offerings like Claude Sonnet-4 in agentic coding tasks and sets new benchmark scores among open models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, Qwen Chat, via Alibaba’s Qwen API, and a growing list of third-party vibe coding and AI tool platforms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-sourcing-licensing-means-low-cost-and-high-optionality-for-enterprises"&gt;Open sourcing licensing means low cost and high optionality for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But unlike Claude and other proprietary models, Qwen3-Coder, which we’ll call it for short, is available now under an open source Apache 2.0 license, meaning it’s free for any enterprise to take without charge, download, modify, deploy and use in their commercial applications for employees or end customers without paying Alibaba or anyone else a dime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also so highly performant on third-party benchmarks and anecdotal usage among AI power users for “vibe coding” — coding using natural language and without formal development processes and steps — that at least one, LLM researcher Sebastian Raschka, wrote on X that: &lt;em&gt;“This might be the best coding model yet. General-purpose is cool, but if you want the best at coding, specialization wins. No free lunch.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers and enterprises interested in downloading it can find the code on the AI code sharing repository Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises who don’t wish to, or don’t have the capacity to host the model on their own or through various third-party cloud inference providers, can also use it directly through the Alibaba Cloud Qwen API, where the per-million token costs start at $1/$5 per million tokens (mTok) for input/output of up to 32,000 tokens, then $1.8/$9 for up to 128,000, $3/$15 for up to 256,000 and $6/$60 for the full million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014612" height="394" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-2.38.14%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-model-architecture-and-capabilities"&gt;Model architecture and capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the documentation released by Qwen Team online, Qwen3-Coder is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 480 billion total parameters, 35 billion active per query, and 8 active experts out of 160. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It supports 256K token context lengths natively, with extrapolation up to 1 million tokens using YaRN (Yet another RoPE extrapolatioN — a technique used to extend a language model’s context length beyond its original training limit by modifying the Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) used during attention computation. This capacity enables the model to understand and manipulate entire repositories or lengthy documents in a single pass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Designed as a causal language model, it features 62 layers, 96 attention heads for queries, and 8 for key-value pairs. It is optimized for token-efficient, instruction-following tasks and omits support for &amp;lt;think&amp;gt; blocks by default, streamlining its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-performance"&gt;High performance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Coder has achieved leading performance among open models on several agentic evaluation suites:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SWE-bench Verified: 67.0% (standard), 69.6% (500-turn)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;GPT-4.1: 54.6%&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview: 49.0%&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Claude Sonnet-4: 70.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model also scores competitively across tasks such as agentic browser use, multi-language programming, and tool use. Visual benchmarks show progressive improvement across training iterations in categories like code generation, SQL programming, code editing, and instruction following.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Alongside the model, Qwen has open-sourced Qwen Code, a CLI tool forked from Gemini Code. This interface supports function calling and structured prompting, making it easier to integrate Qwen3-Coder into coding workflows. Qwen Code supports Node.js environments and can be installed via npm or from source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Coder also integrates with developer platforms such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claude Code (via DashScope proxy or router customization)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cline (as an OpenAI-compatible backend)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can run Qwen3-Coder locally or connect via OpenAI-compatible APIs using endpoints hosted on Alibaba Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-post-training-techniques-code-rl-and-long-horizon-planning"&gt;Post-training techniques: code RL and long-horizon planning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to pretraining on 7.5 trillion tokens (70% code), Qwen3-Coder benefits from advanced post-training techniques:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code RL (Reinforcement Learning): Emphasizes high-quality, execution-driven learning on diverse, verifiable code tasks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Long-Horizon Agent RL: Trains the model to plan, use tools, and adapt over multi-turn interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This phase simulates real-world software engineering challenges. To enable it, Qwen built a 20,000-environment system on Alibaba Cloud, offering the scale necessary for evaluating and training models on complex workflows like those found in SWE-bench.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-implications-ai-for-engineering-and-devops-workflows"&gt;Enterprise implications: AI for engineering and DevOps workflows&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, Qwen3-Coder offers an open, highly capable alternative to closed-source proprietary models. With strong results in coding execution and long-context reasoning, it is especially relevant for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codebase-level understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for AI systems that must comprehend large repositories, technical documentation, or architectural patterns&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated pull request workflows:&lt;/strong&gt; Its ability to plan and adapt across turns makes it suitable for auto-generating or reviewing pull requests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool integration and orchestration:&lt;/strong&gt; Through its native tool-calling APIs and function interface, the model can be embedded in internal tooling and CI/CD systems. This makes it especially viable for agentic workflows and products, i.e., those where the user triggers one or multiple tasks that it wants the AI model to go off and do autonomously, on its own, checking in only when finished or when questions arise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data residency and cost control: &lt;/strong&gt;As an open model, enterprises can deploy Qwen3-Coder on their own infrastructure—whether cloud-native or on-prem—avoiding vendor lock-in and managing compute usage more directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Support for long contexts and modular deployment options across various dev environments makes Qwen3-Coder a candidate for production-grade AI pipelines in both large tech companies and smaller engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developer-access-and-best-practices"&gt;Developer access and best practices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use Qwen3-Coder optimally, Qwen recommends:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sampling settings: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.8, top_k=20, repetition_penalty=1.05&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Output length: Up to 65,536 tokens&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Transformers version: 4.51.0 or later (older versions may throw errors due to qwen3_moe incompatibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;APIs and SDK examples are provided using OpenAI-compatible Python clients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can define custom tools and let Qwen3-Coder dynamically invoke them during conversation or code generation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-warm-early-reception-from-ai-power-users"&gt;Warm early reception from AI power users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial responses to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct have been notably positive among AI researchers, engineers, and developers who have tested the model in real-world coding workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Raschka’s lofty praise above, Wolfram Ravenwolf, an AI engineer and evaluator at EllamindAI, shared his experience integrating the model with Claude Code on X, stating, &lt;em&gt;“This is surely the best one currently.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After testing several integration proxies, Ravenwolf said he ultimately built his own using LiteLLM to ensure optimal performance, demonstrating the model’s appeal to hands-on practitioners focused on toolchain customization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educator and AI tinkerer Kevin Nelson also weighed in on X after using the model for simulation tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Qwen 3 Coder is on another level,”&lt;/em&gt; he posted, noting that the model not only executed on provided scaffolds but even embedded a message within the output of the simulation — an unexpected but welcome sign of the model’s awareness of task context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even Twitter co-founder and Square (now called “Block”) founder Jack Dorsey posted an X message in praise of the model, writing: “&lt;em&gt;Goose + qwen3-coder = wow,&lt;/em&gt;” in reference to his Block’s open source AI agent framework Goose, which VentureBeat covered back in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These responses suggest Qwen3-Coder is resonating with a technically savvy user base seeking performance, adaptability, and deeper integration with existing development stacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-more-sizes-more-use-cases"&gt;Looking ahead: more sizes, more use cases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this release focuses on the most powerful variant, Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, the Qwen team indicates that additional model sizes are in development. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These will aim to offer similar capabilities with lower deployment costs, broadening accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future work also includes exploring self-improvement, as the team investigates whether agentic models can iteratively refine their own performance through real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-implications-ai-for-engineering-and-devops-workflows"&gt;Enterprise implications: AI for engineering and DevOps workflows&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, Qwen3-Coder offers an open, highly capable alternative to closed-source proprietary models. With strong results in coding execution and long-context reasoning, it is especially relevant for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codebase-level understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for AI systems that must comprehend large repositories, technical documentation, or architectural patterns&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated pull request workflows:&lt;/strong&gt; Its ability to plan and adapt across turns makes it suitable for auto-generating or reviewing pull requests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool integration and orchestration:&lt;/strong&gt; Through its native tool-calling APIs and function interface, the model can be embedded in internal tooling and CI/CD systems. This makes it especially viable for agentic workflows and products, i.e., those where the user triggers one or multiple tasks that it wants the AI model to go off and do autonomously, on its own, checking in only when finished or when questions arise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data residency and cost control: &lt;/strong&gt;As an open model, enterprises can deploy Qwen3-Coder on their own infrastructure—whether cloud-native or on-prem—avoiding vendor lock-in and managing compute usage more directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Support for long contexts and modular deployment options across various dev environments makes Qwen3-Coder a candidate for production-grade AI pipelines in both large tech companies and smaller engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developer-access-and-best-practices"&gt;Developer access and best practices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use Qwen3-Coder optimally, Qwen recommends:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sampling settings: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.8, top_k=20, repetition_penalty=1.05&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Output length: Up to 65,536 tokens&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Transformers version: 4.51.0 or later (older versions may throw errors due to qwen3_moe incompatibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;APIs and SDK examples are provided using OpenAI-compatible Python clients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can define custom tools and let Qwen3-Coder dynamically invoke them during conversation or code generation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-warm-early-reception-from-ai-power-users"&gt;Warm early reception from AI power users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial responses to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct have been notably positive among AI researchers, engineers, and developers who have tested the model in real-world coding workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Raschka’s lofty praise above, Wolfram Ravenwolf, an AI engineer and evaluator at EllamindAI, shared his experience integrating the model with Claude Code on X, stating, &lt;em&gt;“This is surely the best one currently.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After testing several integration proxies, Ravenwolf said he ultimately built his own using LiteLLM to ensure optimal performance, demonstrating the model’s appeal to hands-on practitioners focused on toolchain customization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educator and AI tinkerer Kevin Nelson also weighed in on X after using the model for simulation tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Qwen 3 Coder is on another level,”&lt;/em&gt; he posted, noting that the model not only executed on provided scaffolds but even embedded a message within the output of the simulation — an unexpected but welcome sign of the model’s awareness of task context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even Twitter co-founder and Square (now called “Block”) founder Jack Dorsey posted an X message in praise of the model, writing: “&lt;em&gt;Goose + qwen3-coder = wow,&lt;/em&gt;” in reference to his Block’s open source AI agent framework Goose, which VentureBeat covered back in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These responses suggest Qwen3-Coder is resonating with a technically savvy user base seeking performance, adaptability, and deeper integration with existing development stacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-more-sizes-more-use-cases"&gt;Looking ahead: more sizes, more use cases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this release focuses on the most powerful variant, Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, the Qwen team indicates that additional model sizes are in development. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These will aim to offer similar capabilities with lower deployment costs, broadening accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future work also includes exploring self-improvement, as the team investigates whether agentic models can iteratively refine their own performance through real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud,” said Pichai on Google’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. “Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side, and we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing that.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The comment came shortly after analysts peppered Pichai and other Google executives with questions about how AI would affect its core search business and why Google is spending an extra $10 billion on capital expenditures this year to catch up in the AI race. Roughly two and a half years since the launch of ChatGPT, Google has now shifted its focus squarely on developing leading AI models and products to compete with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a major threat to Google Search, but the OpenAI deal marks a massive new customer for Google Cloud. It’s a treacherous relationship for Google to navigate; OpenAI may ultimately use Google’s cloud infrastructure and chips to upend the company’s core Search product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this month, OpenAI quietly added Google Cloud to a public list of suppliers that it uses for cloud computing services, alongside Microsoft and Oracle. Reuters previously reported in June that OpenAI was considering tapping Google Cloud for extra computational power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Google Cloud revenue soared in the second quarter of 2025 to $13.6 billion, up from $10.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Google attributes a significant chunk of that growth to the Google Cloud Platform and other products it offers to AI companies. Google Cloud is still a small business relative to Google Search, but it seems to be growing in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several large AI labs have tapped Google Cloud as a cloud computing partner, including Anthropic, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, and now OpenAI. Pichai noted on the earnings call that the company has been successful at winning deals with large AI labs thanks to its large supply of Nvidia GPU chips and in-house TPU chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google Cloud seems like a smart partner for OpenAI. The startup is extremely constrained when it comes to Nvidia GPUs, which it uses to train new AI models and serve them to hundreds of millions of users. Those constraints have been a major tension point with OpenAI’s biggest backer and largest cloud computing partner, Microsoft, forcing the ChatGPT maker to turn to its competitors in the cloud market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the AI products front, Google seems to be doing better than initially expected. The company said its AI chatbot, Gemini, now reaches 450 million monthly active users, and AI Overviews reaches 2 billion monthly active users. However, the business around these products remains unclear, as does the share of queries they’re taking from Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to imagine that Pichai is truly that excited about working with OpenAI, a company that represents the biggest threat Google Search has ever faced. The partnership is reminiscent of Google’s deal with Yahoo from decades ago, when it was just a startup, and used Yahoo’s homepage as an accelerant to overtake it as the front door to the internet. How lasting OpenAI’s relationship with Google is remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2173545265.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he is “very excited” to supply OpenAI, the search giant’s largest competitor in AI, with cloud computing resources to train and serve the company’s AI models as part of a recently struck partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal combines an AI engine with a 240-person analyst team in Kathmandu, Nepal, to draft, verify and package the answers vendors and buyers need. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like Palantir for security reviews — expert humans and AI working together to accelerate enterprise security assessments,” Hamal said on a recent exclusive video call with VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hamal labels the category “security assurance”: a workflow that sits between traditional compliance software and the sales-ops stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company just announced a fleet of updates in its Q2 blog post this week, including smarter fallback responses from its AI Copilot, a fully brandable White Label Package for Trust Centers, and a new Custom HTML Block for embedding rich media in assurance profile, all geared toward making its AI interactions more professional and informative, even when data is limited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The firm has also added Salesforce Auto-Approval, which enables real-time, criteria-based approvals using live Salesforce data; Global Search across the full SecurityPal platform; and soon, a Custom Tasks feature that should let customers manage workflows with personalized fields and forms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re on a mission to accelerate GDP growth by solving complex security assurance challenges for buyers and sellers,” Hamal added, further offering that, “my thesis when we raised money was that there will be $10 trillion companies, and we’re staring at market caps in the hundreds of billions or more. That demands a radically different capital strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-service-works"&gt;How the service works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal ingests a customer’s existing controls — policies, cloud configurations, attestations — and maps them to a proprietary corpus of roughly 2.5 million previously answered security questions it has assembled from customers and filtered web data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company uses a combination of cutting-edge third-party AI models, among them, those from OpenAI, Google’s Gemini family, and open-source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Hamal emphasized that the true value lies in how those models are applied, explaining: “AI alone is not enough. With AI, you get speed, but you sacrifice quality, judgment, and context.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, SecurityPal integrates AI with expert human analysts in a tightly interlaced workflow, ensuring accuracy and nuance in every security review. While the models are widely available, the company’s proprietary data, deep customer relationships, and human-in-the-loop design form a critical moat that makes their solution far more than just automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI engine takes the first pass; human analysts perform a second pass and final QA to catch hallucinations or missing context. Hamal likens the effect to having an exam key in advance: “It’s almost like SecurityPal knows the answers to the test before the test shows up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the platform maintains a living model of each customer’s posture, new questionnaires rarely require manual digging. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our average SLA [service-level agreement] time is 24 hours, but really, our customers are going down to same-day turnaround,” Hamal says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company says vendor customers can turn around most security questionnaires from prospective buyers up to &lt;strong&gt;87 times faster&lt;/strong&gt; than they could with manual workflows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, by letting its platform handle third-party-risk reviews start to finish, buyers report &lt;strong&gt;as much as 125 times faster&lt;/strong&gt; vendor assessments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third, the aggregated assurance data the system collects becomes a live dashboard that chief information-security and revenue officers can mine for board-level insight rather than spreadsheet trivia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-plus-people-not-ai-instead-of-people"&gt;AI plus people, not AI instead of people&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hamal is quick to stress that SecurityPal’s analysts remain central to the product. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI alone is not enough…you need expert humans layered on top of the technology,” he told VentureBeat, describing the internal workflow as a “centaur” model where machine and human passes alternate throughout the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human layer also feeds a network-effect moat. Each new engagement expands the corpus of accepted answers, which the AI reuses (with fresh evidence) for other customers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal claims coverage of “most of the Fortune 1000” question sets, giving it early knowledge of emerging concerns—for example, the shift from cloud basics to LLM-specific controls noted in recent federal questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-traction-and-business-model"&gt;Traction and business model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal bootstrapped to roughly $1 million in annual recurring revenue before David Sacks’ Craft Ventures pre-empted the company’s first funding round; the $21 million seed deal was signed on a literal napkin, with no slide deck involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The customer roster now includes OpenAI, Airtable, Figma, Snap, a top-three U.S. airline and a top-five U.S. health insurer, among other Fortune-class accounts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal does not disclose pricing publicly, but it sells the service as an annual subscription whose cost undercuts the internal headcount many companies dedicate to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internally, Hamal operates on two continents. Revenue, product and go-to-market teams sit in San Francisco and New York, while the analyst organization forms the kernel of what he calls “Silicon Peaks” — a tech hub 100 miles from Mount Everest that taps Nepal’s deep pool of STEM graduates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buyers-care"&gt;Why buyers care&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For vendors, faster questionnaire turnarounds shorten sales cycles and reduce the risk of stalled deals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For buyers, automated reviews make it feasible to evaluate every supplier instead of sampling a risky few. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outcome, Hamal argues, is alignment between revenue and security teams that have historically been at odds: “There are very few tools that are the favorite tool of the CRO and the CISO. We’re it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competitive-landscape"&gt;Competitive landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start-ups such as Vanta, Drata and Secureframe also target compliance pain points, but they focus on evidence collection and audit preparation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal’s differentiator is doing the actual writing and response work—something Hamal believes will prove harder for pure-software rivals to automate because it still requires judgment and domain expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kathmandu center of excellence gives SecurityPal a cost base low enough to keep humans in the loop while staying price-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal’s near-term goal is to help 5,000 global enterprises tame their most complex assurance challenges within five years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Longer term, Hamal sees the service as infrastructure for an economy where every significant transaction carries a security or privacy attestation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s called SecurityPal, but it’s way more than just about security,” he said, adding “I look to Salesforce—it’s way more than just sales. Same for us. It’s all about satisfying requirements and accelerating deals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that forecast is correct, the company’s combination of AI scale and human nuance could become a standard part of enterprise procurement, whether or not anyone notices the “vibe coding” origin story along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal combines an AI engine with a 240-person analyst team in Kathmandu, Nepal, to draft, verify and package the answers vendors and buyers need. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like Palantir for security reviews — expert humans and AI working together to accelerate enterprise security assessments,” Hamal said on a recent exclusive video call with VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hamal labels the category “security assurance”: a workflow that sits between traditional compliance software and the sales-ops stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company just announced a fleet of updates in its Q2 blog post this week, including smarter fallback responses from its AI Copilot, a fully brandable White Label Package for Trust Centers, and a new Custom HTML Block for embedding rich media in assurance profile, all geared toward making its AI interactions more professional and informative, even when data is limited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The firm has also added Salesforce Auto-Approval, which enables real-time, criteria-based approvals using live Salesforce data; Global Search across the full SecurityPal platform; and soon, a Custom Tasks feature that should let customers manage workflows with personalized fields and forms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re on a mission to accelerate GDP growth by solving complex security assurance challenges for buyers and sellers,” Hamal added, further offering that, “my thesis when we raised money was that there will be $10 trillion companies, and we’re staring at market caps in the hundreds of billions or more. That demands a radically different capital strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-service-works"&gt;How the service works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal ingests a customer’s existing controls — policies, cloud configurations, attestations — and maps them to a proprietary corpus of roughly 2.5 million previously answered security questions it has assembled from customers and filtered web data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company uses a combination of cutting-edge third-party AI models, among them, those from OpenAI, Google’s Gemini family, and open-source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Hamal emphasized that the true value lies in how those models are applied, explaining: “AI alone is not enough. With AI, you get speed, but you sacrifice quality, judgment, and context.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, SecurityPal integrates AI with expert human analysts in a tightly interlaced workflow, ensuring accuracy and nuance in every security review. While the models are widely available, the company’s proprietary data, deep customer relationships, and human-in-the-loop design form a critical moat that makes their solution far more than just automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI engine takes the first pass; human analysts perform a second pass and final QA to catch hallucinations or missing context. Hamal likens the effect to having an exam key in advance: “It’s almost like SecurityPal knows the answers to the test before the test shows up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the platform maintains a living model of each customer’s posture, new questionnaires rarely require manual digging. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our average SLA [service-level agreement] time is 24 hours, but really, our customers are going down to same-day turnaround,” Hamal says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company says vendor customers can turn around most security questionnaires from prospective buyers up to &lt;strong&gt;87 times faster&lt;/strong&gt; than they could with manual workflows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, by letting its platform handle third-party-risk reviews start to finish, buyers report &lt;strong&gt;as much as 125 times faster&lt;/strong&gt; vendor assessments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third, the aggregated assurance data the system collects becomes a live dashboard that chief information-security and revenue officers can mine for board-level insight rather than spreadsheet trivia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-plus-people-not-ai-instead-of-people"&gt;AI plus people, not AI instead of people&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hamal is quick to stress that SecurityPal’s analysts remain central to the product. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI alone is not enough…you need expert humans layered on top of the technology,” he told VentureBeat, describing the internal workflow as a “centaur” model where machine and human passes alternate throughout the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human layer also feeds a network-effect moat. Each new engagement expands the corpus of accepted answers, which the AI reuses (with fresh evidence) for other customers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal claims coverage of “most of the Fortune 1000” question sets, giving it early knowledge of emerging concerns—for example, the shift from cloud basics to LLM-specific controls noted in recent federal questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-traction-and-business-model"&gt;Traction and business model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal bootstrapped to roughly $1 million in annual recurring revenue before David Sacks’ Craft Ventures pre-empted the company’s first funding round; the $21 million seed deal was signed on a literal napkin, with no slide deck involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The customer roster now includes OpenAI, Airtable, Figma, Snap, a top-three U.S. airline and a top-five U.S. health insurer, among other Fortune-class accounts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal does not disclose pricing publicly, but it sells the service as an annual subscription whose cost undercuts the internal headcount many companies dedicate to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internally, Hamal operates on two continents. Revenue, product and go-to-market teams sit in San Francisco and New York, while the analyst organization forms the kernel of what he calls “Silicon Peaks” — a tech hub 100 miles from Mount Everest that taps Nepal’s deep pool of STEM graduates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buyers-care"&gt;Why buyers care&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For vendors, faster questionnaire turnarounds shorten sales cycles and reduce the risk of stalled deals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For buyers, automated reviews make it feasible to evaluate every supplier instead of sampling a risky few. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outcome, Hamal argues, is alignment between revenue and security teams that have historically been at odds: “There are very few tools that are the favorite tool of the CRO and the CISO. We’re it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competitive-landscape"&gt;Competitive landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start-ups such as Vanta, Drata and Secureframe also target compliance pain points, but they focus on evidence collection and audit preparation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal’s differentiator is doing the actual writing and response work—something Hamal believes will prove harder for pure-software rivals to automate because it still requires judgment and domain expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kathmandu center of excellence gives SecurityPal a cost base low enough to keep humans in the loop while staying price-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SecurityPal’s near-term goal is to help 5,000 global enterprises tame their most complex assurance challenges within five years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Longer term, Hamal sees the service as infrastructure for an economy where every significant transaction carries a security or privacy attestation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s called SecurityPal, but it’s way more than just about security,” he said, adding “I look to Salesforce—it’s way more than just sales. Same for us. It’s all about satisfying requirements and accelerating deals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that forecast is correct, the company’s combination of AI scale and human nuance could become a standard part of enterprise procurement, whether or not anyone notices the “vibe coding” origin story along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump signed the AI Action Plan, which outlines a path for the U.S. to lead in the AI race. For enterprises already in the throes of deploying AI systems, the rules represent a clear indication of how this administration intends to treat AI going forward and could signal how providers will approach AI development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much like the AI executive order signed by Joe Biden in 2023, Trump’s order primarily concerns government offices, directing how they can contract with AI models and application providers, as it is not a legislative act.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI plan may not directly affect enterprises immediately, but analysts noted that anytime the government takes a position on AI, the ecosystem changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This plan will likely shape the ecosystem we all operate in — one that rewards those who can move fast, stay aligned and deliver real-world outcomes,” Matt Wood, commercial technology and innovation officer at PwC, told VentureBeat in an email. “For enterprises, the signal is clear: the pace of AI adoption is accelerating, and the cost of lagging is going up. Even if the plan centers on federal agencies, the ripple effects — in procurement, infrastructure, and norms — will reach much further. We’ll likely see new government-backed testbeds, procurement programs, and funding streams emerge — and enterprises that can partner, pilot, or productize in this environment will be well-positioned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the Action Plan “is not a blueprint for enterprise AI.” Still, enterprises should expect an AI development environment that prioritizes speed, scale, experimentation and less reliance on regulatory shelters. Companies working with the government should also be prepared for additional scrutiny on the models and applications they use, to ensure alignment with the government’s values.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Action Plan outlines how government agencies can collaborate with AI companies, prioritize recommended tasks to invest in infrastructure and encourage AI development and establish guidelines for exporting and importing AI tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Charleyne Biondi, assistant vice president and analyst at Moody’s Ratings, said the plan “highlights AI’s role as an increasingly strategic asset and core driver of economic transformation.” She noted, however, that that plan doesn’t address regulatory fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, current regulatory fragmentation across U.S. states could create uncertainty for developers and businesses. Striking the right balance between innovation and safety and between national ambition and regulatory clarity will be critical to ensure continued enterprise adoption and avoid unintended slowdowns,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-inside-the-action-plan"&gt;What is inside the action plan&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI Action Plan is broken down into three pillars: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accelerating AI innovation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Building American AI infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leading in international AI diplomacy and security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key headline piece of the AI Action Plan centers on “ensuring free speech and American values,” a significant talking point for this administration. It instructs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to remove references to misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion. It prevents agencies from working with foundation models that have “top-down agendas.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how the government expects existing models and datasets to follow suit, or what this kind of AI would look like. Enterprises are especially concerned about potentially controversial statements AI systems can make, as evidenced by the recent Grok kerfuffle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also orders NIST to research and publish findings to ensure that models from China, such as DeepSeek, Qwen and Kimi, are not aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the most consequential positions involve supporting open-source systems, creating a new testing and evaluation ecosystem, and streamlining the process for building data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through the plan, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation are directed to develop “AI testbeds for piloting AI systems in secure, real-world settings,” allowing researchers to prototype systems. It also removes much of the red tape associated with evaluating safety testing for models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What has excited many in the industry is the explicit support for open-source AI and open-weight models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values. Open-source and open-weight models could become global standards in some areas of business and academic research worldwide. For that reason, they also have geostrategic value. While the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models,” the plan said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understandably, open-source proponents like Hugging Face’s Clement Delangue praised this decision on social media, saying: “It’s time for the American AI community to wake up, drop the “open is not safe” bullshit, and return to its roots: open science and open-source AI, powered by an unmatched community of frontier labs, big tech, startups, universities, and non‑profits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;It’s time for the American AI community to wake up, drop the "open is not safe" bullshit, and return to its roots: open science and open-source AI, powered by an unmatched community of frontier labs, big tech, startups, universities, and non‑profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we don’t, we’ll be forced… https://t.co/NxnhdMhUgH&lt;/p&gt;— clem ? (@ClementDelangue) July 23, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCG managing director Sesh Iyer told VentureBeat this would give enterprises more confidence in adopting open-source LLMs and could also encourage more closed-source providers “to rethink proprietary strategies and potentially consider releasing model weights.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plan does mention that cloud providers should prioritize the Department of Defense, which could bump some enterprises down an already crowded waiting list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-little-more-clarity-on-rules"&gt;A little more clarity on rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI Action Plan is more akin to an executive order and can only direct government agencies under the purview of the Executive branch. Full AI regulation, one that endures through multiple administrations, can only be achieved through Congress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises understood that the change in administration may mean less emphasis on AI regulations, and braced themselves for that impact. The Trump administration revoked Biden’s EO, halting many of the projects already underway after it was signed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the signing of the Action Plan, the Trump administration at least lays out its priorities and stance on AI development, which would help increase enterprise confidence in the technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;The White House AI Action Plan gets it right on infrastructure, federal adoption, and safety coordination. It reflects many policy aims core to Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) July 23, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, even in the absence of an EO or Congress-led regulation, enterprises were already building and expanding the AI ecosystem. Although there is some concern over the lack of rules and the uncertainty that comes with it, it was never going to stop businesses from being excited about a technology that promises to make their work easier. The plan, at least, makes it easier to grow more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It lowers some external friction, like faster permits, more data center capacity, and potential funding. But real acceleration happens inside the enterprise: skills, governance, and the ability to deploy responsibly. Those who’ve already built that muscle will be best positioned to capitalize on the momentum the plan generates,” PwC’s Wood said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how the government expects existing models and datasets to follow suit, or what this kind of AI would look like. Enterprises are especially concerned about potentially controversial statements AI systems can make, as evidenced by the recent Grok kerfuffle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also orders NIST to research and publish findings to ensure that models from China, such as DeepSeek, Qwen and Kimi, are not aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the most consequential positions involve supporting open-source systems, creating a new testing and evaluation ecosystem, and streamlining the process for building data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through the plan, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation are directed to develop “AI testbeds for piloting AI systems in secure, real-world settings,” allowing researchers to prototype systems. It also removes much of the red tape associated with evaluating safety testing for models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What has excited many in the industry is the explicit support for open-source AI and open-weight models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure America has leading open models founded on American values. Open-source and open-weight models could become global standards in some areas of business and academic research worldwide. For that reason, they also have geostrategic value. While the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models,” the plan said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understandably, open-source proponents like Hugging Face’s Clement Delangue praised this decision on social media, saying: “It’s time for the American AI community to wake up, drop the “open is not safe” bullshit, and return to its roots: open science and open-source AI, powered by an unmatched community of frontier labs, big tech, startups, universities, and non‑profits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCG managing director Sesh Iyer told VentureBeat this would give enterprises more confidence in adopting open-source LLMs and could also encourage more closed-source providers “to rethink proprietary strategies and potentially consider releasing model weights.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plan does mention that cloud providers should prioritize the Department of Defense, which could bump some enterprises down an already crowded waiting list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-little-more-clarity-on-rules"&gt;A little more clarity on rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI Action Plan is more akin to an executive order and can only direct government agencies under the purview of the Executive branch. Full AI regulation, one that endures through multiple administrations, can only be achieved through Congress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises understood that the change in administration may mean less emphasis on AI regulations, and braced themselves for that impact. The Trump administration revoked Biden’s EO, halting many of the projects already underway after it was signed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the signing of the Action Plan, the Trump administration at least lays out its priorities and stance on AI development, which would help increase enterprise confidence in the technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;The White House AI Action Plan gets it right on infrastructure, federal adoption, and safety coordination. It reflects many policy aims core to Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) July 23, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, even in the absence of an EO or Congress-led regulation, enterprises were already building and expanding the AI ecosystem. Although there is some concern over the lack of rules and the uncertainty that comes with it, it was never going to stop businesses from being excited about a technology that promises to make their work easier. The plan, at least, makes it easier to grow more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It lowers some external friction, like faster permits, more data center capacity, and potential funding. But real acceleration happens inside the enterprise: skills, governance, and the ability to deploy responsibly. Those who’ve already built that muscle will be best positioned to capitalize on the momentum the plan generates,” PwC’s Wood said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. officials later confirmed that these tools are engineered to reflect Beijing’s talking points, raising concerns about censorship and bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;American AI leaders like OpenAI have pointed to this as justification for advancing their tech quickly, without too much regulation or oversight. As OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote in a LinkedIn post last month, there is a contest between “US-led democratic AI and Communist-led China’s autocratic AI.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An executive order signed Wednesday by President Donald Trump that bans “woke AI” and AI models that aren’t “ideologically neutral” from government contracts could disrupt that balance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order calls out diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), calling it a “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.” Specifically, the order refers to information about race or sex, manipulation of racial or sexual representation, critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Experts warn it could create a chilling effect on developers who may feel pressure to align model outputs and datasets with White House rhetoric to secure federal dollars for their cash-burning businesses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order comes the same day the White House published Trump’s “AI Action Plan,” which shifts national priorities away from societal risk and focuses instead on building out AI infrastructure, cutting red tape for tech companies, shoring up national security, and competing with China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget along with the administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the administrator of General Services, and the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue guidance to other agencies on how to comply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once and for all, we are getting rid of woke,” Trump said Wednesday during an AI event hosted by the All-In Podcast and Hill &amp;amp; Valley Forum. “I will be signing an order banning the federal government from procuring AI technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas, such as critical race theory, which is ridiculous. And from now on the U.S. government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness, and strict impartiality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Determining what is impartial or objective is one of many challenges to the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Philip Seargeant, senior lecturer in applied linguistics at the Open University, told TechCrunch that nothing can ever be objective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the fundamental tenets of sociolinguistics is that language is never neutral,” Seargeant said. “So the idea that you can ever get pure objectivity is a fantasy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, the Trump administration’s ideology doesn’t reflect the beliefs and values of all Americans. Trump has repeatedly sought to eliminate funding for climate initiatives, education, public broadcasting, research, social service grants, community and agricultural support programs, and gender-affirming care, often framing these initiatives as examples of “woke” or politically biased government spending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, put it, “Anything [the Trump administration doesn’t] like is immediately tossed into this pejorative pile of woke.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The definitions of “truth-seeking” and “ideological neutrality” in the order published Wednesday are vague in some ways and specific in others. While “truth-seeking” is defined as LLMs that “prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity,” “ideological neutrality” is defined as LLMs that are “neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those definitions leave room for broad interpretation, as well as potential pressure. AI companies have pushed for fewer constraints on how they operate. And while an executive order doesn’t carry the force of legislation, frontier AI firms could still find themselves subject to the shifting priorities of the administration’s political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last week, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI signed contracts with the Department of Defense to receive up to $200 million each to develop agentic AI workflows that address critical national security challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s unclear which of these companies is best positioned to gain from the woke AI ban, or if they will comply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has reached out to each of them and will update this article if we hear back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite displaying biases of its own, xAI may be the most aligned with the order — at least at this early stage. Elon Musk has positioned Grok, xAI’s chatbot, as the ultimate anti-woke, “less biased,” truthseeker. Grok’s system prompts have directed it to avoid deferring to mainstream authorities and media, to seek contrarian information even if it’s politically incorrect, and to even reference Musk’s own views on controversial topics. In recent months, Grok has even spouted antisemitic comments and praised Hitler on X, among other hateful, racist, and misogynistic posts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, told TechCrunch the executive order is “clearly intended as viewpoint discrimination, since [the government] just signed a contract with Grok, aka ‘MechaHitler.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside xAI’s DOD funding, the company announced that “Grok for Government” had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?” Lemley said in an email interview. “If not, it is clearly designed to discriminate against a particular viewpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Grok’s own system prompts have shown, model outputs can be a reflection of both the people building the technology and the data the AI is trained on. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Google, for example, last year came under fire after its Gemini chatbot showed a black George Washington and racially diverse Nazis — which Trump’s order calls out as an example of DEI-infected AI models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. She pointed to statements from Musk a few weeks prior to launching Grok 4, saying that xAI would use the new model and its advanced reasoning capabilities to “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors. Then retrain on that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This would ostensibly put Musk into the position of judging what is true, which could have huge downstream implications for how information is accessed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, companies have been making judgment calls about what information is seen and not seen since the dawn of the internet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Conservative David Sacks — the entrepreneur and investor who Trump appointed as AI czar — has been outspoken about his concerns around “woke AI” on the All-In Podcast, which co-hosted Trump’s day of AI announcements. Sacks has accused the creators of prominent AI products of infusing them with left-wing values, framing his arguments as a defense of free speech, and a warning against a trend toward centralized ideological control in digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem, experts say, is that there is no one truth. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today’s world where even facts are politicized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If the results that an AI produces say that climate science is correct, is that left wing bias?” Seargeant said. “Some people say you need to give both sides of the argument to be objective, even if one side of the argument has no status to it.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2225853634.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When DeepSeek, Alibaba, and other Chinese firms released their AI models, Western researchers quickly noticed they sidestepped questions critical of the Chinese Communist Party.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday at 5pm PST, the nonprofit Laude Institute announced the first winner of the K Prize, a multi-round AI coding challenge launched by Databricks and Perplexity co-founder Andy Konwinski. The winner was a Brazilian prompt engineer named Eduardo Rocha de Andrade, who will receive $50,000 for the prize. But more surprising than the win was his final score: he won with correct answers to just 7.5% of the questions on the test.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re glad we built a benchmark that is actually hard,” said Konwinski. “Benchmarks should be hard if they’re going to matter,” he continued, adding: “Scores would be different if the big labs had entered with their biggest models. But that’s kind of the point. K Prize runs offline with limited compute, so it favors smaller and open models. I love that. It levels the playing field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Konwinski has pledged $1 million to the first open-source model that can score higher than 90% on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to the well-known SWE-Bench system, the K Prize tests models against flagged issues from GitHub as a test of how well models can deal with real-world programming problems. But while SWE-Bench is based on a fixed set of problems that models can train against, the K Prize is designed as a “contamination-free version of SWE-Bench,” using a timed entry system to guard against any benchmark-specific training. For round one, models were due by March 12th. The K Prize organizers then built the test using only GitHub issues flagged after that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 7.5% top score stands in marked contrast to SWE-Bench itself, which currently shows a 75% top score on its easier ‘Verified’ test and 34% on its harder ‘Full’ test. Konwinski still isn’t sure whether the disparity is due to contamination on SWE-Bench or just the challenge of collecting new issues from GitHub, but he expects the K Prize project to answer the question soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As we get more runs of the thing, we’ll have a better sense,” he told TechCrunch, “because we expect people to adapt to the dynamics of competing on this every few months.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It might seem like an odd place to fall short, given the wide range of AI coding tools already publicly available – but with benchmarks becoming too easy, many critics see projects like the K Prize as a necessary step toward solving AI’s growing evaluation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m quite bullish about building new tests for existing benchmarks,” says Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor, who put forward a similar idea in a recent paper. “Without such experiments, we can’t actually tell if the issue is contamination, or even just targeting the SWE-Bench leaderboard with a human in the loop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Konwinski, it’s not just a better benchmark, but an open challenge to the rest of the industry. “If you listen to the hype, it’s like we should be seeing AI doctors and AI lawyers and AI software engineers, and that’s just not true,” he says. “If we can’t even get more than 10% on a contamination free SWE-Bench, that’s the reality check for me.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1388336038.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A new AI coding challenge has revealed its first winner — and set a new bar for AI-powered software engineers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday at 5pm PST, the nonprofit Laude Institute announced the first winner of the K Prize, a multi-round AI coding challenge launched by Databricks and Perplexity co-founder Andy Konwinski. The winner was a Brazilian prompt engineer named Eduardo Rocha de Andrade, who will receive $50,000 for the prize. But more surprising than the win was his final score: he won with correct answers to just 7.5% of the questions on the test.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re glad we built a benchmark that is actually hard,” said Konwinski. “Benchmarks should be hard if they’re going to matter,” he continued, adding: “Scores would be different if the big labs had entered with their biggest models. But that’s kind of the point. K Prize runs offline with limited compute, so it favors smaller and open models. I love that. It levels the playing field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Konwinski has pledged $1 million to the first open-source model that can score higher than 90% on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to the well-known SWE-Bench system, the K Prize tests models against flagged issues from GitHub as a test of how well models can deal with real-world programming problems. But while SWE-Bench is based on a fixed set of problems that models can train against, the K Prize is designed as a “contamination-free version of SWE-Bench,” using a timed entry system to guard against any benchmark-specific training. For round one, models were due by March 12th. The K Prize organizers then built the test using only GitHub issues flagged after that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 7.5% top score stands in marked contrast to SWE-Bench itself, which currently shows a 75% top score on its easier ‘Verified’ test and 34% on its harder ‘Full’ test.

The effort to balance algorithmic innovation with real-world application has been a consistent theme in the career of Xinxing Xu, principal researcher at Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore, and also represents one of the foundational pillars of the newly established Singapore lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="photo of Xinxing Xu standing against a gray background" class="wp-image-1145600" height="540" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Xinxing-Xu-1-1.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Xinxing Xu, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Innovative algorithms can only demonstrate their true value when tested with real-world data and in actual scenarios, where they can be continuously optimized through iteration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu’s commitment to balancing algorithmic innovation with practical application has shaped his entire career. During his PhD studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Xu focused on emerging technologies like multiple kernel learning methods and multimodal machine learning. Today he’s applying these techniques to real-world use cases like image recognition and video classification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After completing his doctorate, he joined the Institute of High Performance Computing at Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), where he worked on interdisciplinary projects ranging from medical image recognition to AI systems for detecting defects on facade of buildings. These experiences broadened his perspective and deepened his passion for translating AI into real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Xu joined Microsoft Research Asia where he began a new chapter focused on bridging between academic research and real-world AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft Research Asia is committed to integrating scientific exploration with real-world applications, which creates a unique research environment,” Xu says. “It brings together top talent and resources, and Microsoft’s engineering and product ecosystem strongly supports turning research into impactful technology. The lab’s open and inclusive culture encourages innovation with broader societal impact. It reflects the approach to research I’ve always hoped to contribute to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bringing-cross-domain-expertise-to-ai-s-real-world-frontiers"&gt;Bringing cross-domain expertise to AI’s real-world frontiers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a key hub in Microsoft Research’s network across Asia, the Singapore lab is guided by a three-part mission: to drive industry-transforming AI deployment, pursue fundamental breakthroughs in the field, and promote responsible, socially beneficial applications of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach these goals, Xu and his colleagues are working closely with local collaborators, combining cross-disciplinary expertise to tackle complex, real-world challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu draws on his experience in healthcare as he leads the team’s collaboration with Singapore’s SingHealth to explore how AI can support precision medicine. Their efforts focus on leveraging SingHealth’s data and expertise to develop AI capabilities aimed at delivering personalized analysis and enhanced diagnostic accuracy to enable better patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond healthcare, the team is also targeting key sectors like finance and logistics. By developing domain-specific foundation models and AI agents, they aim to support smarter decision-making and accelerate digital transformation across industries. “Singapore has a strong foundation in these sectors,” Xu notes, “making it an ideal environment for technology validation and iteration.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team is also partnering with leading academic institutions, including the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), to advance the field of spatial intelligence. Their goal is to develop embodied intelligence systems capable of carrying out complex tasks in smart environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life, researchers at the Singapore lab are also increasingly focused on what they call “societal AI”—building AI systems that are culturally relevant and trustworthy within Southeast Asia’s unique cultural and social contexts. Working with global colleagues, they are helping to advance a more culturally grounded and responsible approach to AI research in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-research-asia-singapore-expanding-global-reach-connecting-regional-innovation"&gt;Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore: Expanding global reach, connecting regional innovation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Realizing AI’s full potential requires more than technical breakthroughs. It also depends on collaboration—across industries, academia, and policy. Only through this intersection of forces can AI move beyond the lab to deliver meaningful societal value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s strengths in science, engineering, and digital governance make it an ideal setting for this kind of work. Its collaborative culture, robust infrastructure, international talent pool, and strong policy support for science and technology make it fertile ground for interdisciplinary research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why Microsoft Research Asia continues to collaborate closely with Singapore’s top universities, research institutions, and industry partners. These partnerships support joint research, talent development, and technical exchange. Building on this foundation, Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore will further deepen its collaboration with NUS, NTU Singapore, and Singapore Management University (SMU) to advance both fundamental and applied research, while equipping the next generation of researchers with real-world experience. In addition, Microsoft Research Asia is fostering academic exchange and strengthening the research ecosystem through summer schools and joint workshops with NUS, NTU Singapore, and SMU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Singapore lab further marks an important step in expanding the company’s global research footprint, serving as a bridge between regional innovation and Microsoft’s global ecosystem. Through its integrated lab network, Microsoft Research fosters the sharing of technologies, methods, and real-world insights, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We aim to build a research hub in Singapore that is globally connected and deeply rooted in the local ecosystem,” Xu says. “Many breakthroughs come from interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration. By breaking boundaries—across disciplines, industries, and geographies—we can drive research that has lasting impact.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more deeply woven into industry and everyday life, Xu believes that meaningful research must be closely connected to regional development and social well-being.&lt;br /&gt;“Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore is a future-facing lab,” he says. “While we push technological frontiers, we’re equally committed to the responsibility of technology—ensuring AI can help address society’s most pressing challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a world shaped by global challenges, Xu sees collaboration and innovation as essential to real progress. With Singapore as a launchpad, he and his team are working to extend AI’s impact and value across Southeast Asia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Xingxing Xu (center) with colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia - Singapore&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-1145598" height="768" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Xinxing-with-colleagues.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Xingxing Xu (center) with colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="three-essential-strengths-for-the-next-generation-of-ai-researchers"&gt;Three essential strengths for the next generation of AI researchers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI’s progress depends not only on technical breakthroughs but also on the growth and dedication of talent. At Microsoft Research Asia, there is a strong belief that bringing research into the real world requires more than technical coordination—it depends on unlocking the full creativity and potential of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Singapore—a regional innovation hub that connects Southeast Asia—Xu and his colleagues are working to push AI beyond the lab and into fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. For young researchers hoping to shape the future of AI, this is a uniquely powerful stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help guide the next generation, Xu shares three pieces of advice:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a strong foundation&lt;/strong&gt; – “Core knowledge in machine learning, linear algebra, and probability and statistics is the bedrock of AI research,” Xu says. “A solid theoretical base is essential to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving field. Even today’s hottest trends in generative AI rely on longstanding principles of optimization and model architecture design.” While code generation tools are on the rise, Xu emphasizes that mathematical fundamentals remain essential for understanding and innovating in AI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand real-world applications&lt;/strong&gt; – Technical skills alone aren’t enough. Xu encourages young researchers to deeply engage with the problems they’re trying to solve. Only by tightly integrating technology with its context can researchers create truly valuable solutions.&lt;p&gt;“In healthcare, for example, researchers may need to follow doctors in clinics to gain a true understanding of clinical workflows. That context helps identify the best entry points for AI deployment. Framing research problems around real-world needs is often more impactful than just tuning model parameters,” Xu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop interdisciplinary thinking&lt;/strong&gt; – Cross-disciplinary collaboration is becoming essential to AI innovation. Xu advises young researchers to learn how to work with experts from other fields to explore new directions together. “These kinds of interactions often spark fresh, creative ideas,” he says.&lt;p&gt;Maintaining curiosity is just as important. “Being open to new technologies and fields is what enables researchers to continually break new ground and produce original results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xu extends an open invitation to aspiring researchers from all backgrounds to join Microsoft Research Asia – Singapore. “We offer a unique platform that blends cutting-edge research with real-world impact,” he says. “It’s a place where you can work on the frontiers of AI—and see how your work can help transform industries and improve lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
