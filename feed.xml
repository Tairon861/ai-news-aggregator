Basically, the idea is to use trees or some other types of biomass for energy, and then capture the emissions when you burn it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While corporations, including tech giants like Microsoft, are betting big on this technology, there are a few potential problems with BECCS, as my colleague James Temple laid out in a new story. And some of the concerns echo similar problems with other climate technologies we cover, like carbon offsets and alternative jet fuels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon math can be complicated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To illustrate one of the biggest issues with BECCS, we need to run through the logic on its carbon accounting. (And while this tech can use many different forms of biomass, let’s assume we’re talking about trees.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When trees grow, they suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those trees can be harvested and used for some intended purpose, like making paper. The leftover material, which might otherwise be waste, is then processed and burned for energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This cycle is, in theory, carbon neutral. The emissions from burning the biomass are canceled out by what was removed from the atmosphere during plants’ growth. (Assuming those trees are replaced after they’re harvested.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So now imagine that carbon-scrubbing equipment is added to the facility that burns the biomass, capturing emissions. If the cycle was logically carbon neutral before, now it’s carbon negative: On net, emissions are removed from the atmosphere. Sounds great, no notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a few problems with this math, though. For one, it leaves out the emissions that might be produced while harvesting, transporting, and processing wood. And if projects require clearing land to plant trees or grow crops, that transformation can wind up releasing emissions too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Issues with carbon math might sound a little familiar if you’ve read any of James’s reporting on carbon offsets, programs where people pay for others to avoid emissions. In particular, his 2021 investigation with ProPublica’s Lisa Song laid out how this so-called solution was actually adding millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon capture may entrench polluting facilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the big benefits of BECCS is that it can be added to existing facilities. There’s less building involved than there might be in something like a facility that vacuums carbon directly out of air. That helps keep costs down, so BECCS is currently much cheaper than direct air capture and other forms of carbon removal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But keeping legacy equipment running might not be a great thing for emissions or local communities in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is far from the only pollutant spewing out of these facilities. Burning biomass or biofuels can release emissions that harm human health, like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Carbon capture equipment might trap some of these pollutants, like sulfur dioxide, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assuming that waste material wouldn’t be used for something else might not be right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounds great to use waste, but there’s a major asterisk lurking here, as James lays out in the story:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Biomass can be used for other things, like making plastic, building material, or even soil additives that can help crops get more nutrients. So the assumption that it’s BECCS or nothing is flawed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a weird thing happens when you start making waste valuable: There’s an incentive to produce more of it. Some experts are concerned that companies could wind up trimming more trees or clearing more forests than what’s needed to make more material for BECCS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These waste issues remind me of conversations around sustainable aviation fuels. These alternative fuels can be made from a huge range of materials, including crop waste or even used cooking oil. But as demand for these clean fuels has ballooned, things have gotten a little wonky—there are even some reports of fraud, where scammers try to pass off newly made oil from crops as used cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BECCS is a potentially useful technology, but like many things in climate tech, it can quickly get complicated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;James has been reporting on carbon offsets and carbon removal for years.

This bundle of cells, about the size of a grain of sand pulled from a powdery white Caribbean beach, contains the coiled potential of a future life: 46 chromosomes, thousands of genes, and roughly six billion base pairs of DNA—an instruction manual to assemble a one-of-a-kind human.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst’s outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become. Some parents turn to these tests to avoid passing on devastating genetic disorders that run in their families. A much smaller group, driven by dreams of Ivy League diplomas or attractive, well-behaved offspring, are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to optimize for intelligence, appearance, and personality. Some of the most eager early boosters of this technology are members of the Silicon Valley elite, including tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But customers of the companies emerging to provide it to the public may not be getting what they’re paying for. Genetics experts have been highlighting the potential deficiencies of this testing for years. A 2021 paper by members of the European Society of Human Genetics said, “No clinical research has been performed to assess its diagnostic effectiveness in embryos. Patients need to be properly informed on the limitations of this use.” And a paper published this May in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; echoed this concern and expressed particular reservations about screening for psychiatric disorders and non-­disease-related traits: “Unfortunately, no clinical research has to date been published comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy [of predictive testing]. Patient awareness regarding the limitations of this procedure is paramount.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the assumptions underlying some of this work—that how a person turns out is the product not of privilege or circumstance but of innate biology—have made these companies a political lightning rod.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125496" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_1.jpg?w=1388" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;As this niche technology begins to make its way toward the mainstream, scientists and ethicists are racing to confront the implications—for our social contract, for future generations, and for our very understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), while still relatively rare, is not new. Since the 1990s, parents undergoing in vitro fertilization have been able to access a number of genetic tests before choosing which embryo to use. A type known as PGT-M can detect single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. PGT-A can ascertain the sex of an embryo and identify chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to conditions like Down syndrome or reduce the chances that an embryo will implant successfully in the uterus. PGT-SR helps parents avoid embryos with issues such as duplicated or missing segments of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those tests all identify clear-cut genetic problems that are relatively easy to detect, but most of the genetic instruction manual included in an embryo is written in far more nuanced code. In recent years, a fledgling market has sprung up around a new, more advanced version of the testing process called PGT-P: preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits)—that is, outcomes determined by the elaborate interaction of hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the first baby selected using PGT-P was born. While the exact figure is unknown, estimates put the number of children who have now been born with the aid of this technology in the hundreds. As the technology is commercialized, that number is likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards indicating their predispositions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A handful of startups, armed with tens of millions of dollars of Silicon Valley cash, have developed proprietary algorithms to compute these stats—analyzing vast numbers of genetic variants and producing a “polygenic risk score” that shows the probability of an embryo developing a variety of complex traits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the last five years or so, two companies—Genomic Prediction and Orchid—have dominated this small landscape, focusing their efforts on disease prevention. But more recently, two splashy new competitors have emerged: Nucleus Genomics and Herasight, which have rejected the more cautious approach of their predecessors and waded into the controversial territory of genetic testing for intelligence. (Nucleus also offers tests for a wide variety of other behavioral and appearance-related traits.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The practical limitations of polygenic risk scores are substantial. For starters, there is still a lot we don’t understand about the complex gene interactions driving polygenic traits and disorders. And the biobank data sets they are based on tend to overwhelmingly represent individuals with Western European ancestry, making it more difficult to generate reliable scores for patients from other backgrounds. These scores also lack the full context of environment, lifestyle, and the myriad other factors that can influence a person’s characteristics. And while polygenic risk scores can be effective at detecting large, population-level trends, their predictive abilities drop significantly when the sample size is as tiny as a single batch of embryos that share much of the same DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medical community—including organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine—is generally wary of using polygenic risk scores for embryo selection. “The practice has moved too fast with too little evidence,” the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics wrote in an official statement in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But beyond questions of whether evidence supports the technology’s effectiveness, critics of the companies selling it accuse them of reviving a disturbing ideology: eugenics, or the belief that selective breeding can be used to improve humanity. Indeed, some of the voices who have been most confident that these methods can successfully predict nondisease traits have made startling claims about natural genetic hierarchies and innate racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What everyone can agree on, though, is that this new wave of technology is helping to inflame a centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “eugenics” was coined in 1883 by a British anthropologist and statistician named Sir Francis Galton, inspired in part by the work of his cousin Charles Darwin. He derived it from a Greek word meaning “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of modern history’s darkest chapters have been built on Galton’s legacy, from the Holocaust to the forced sterilization laws that affected certain groups in the United States well into the 20th century. Modern science has demonstrated the many logical and empirical problems with Galton’s methodology. (For starters, he counted vague concepts like “eminence”—as well as infections like syphilis and tuberculosis—as heritable phenotypes, meaning characteristics that result from the interaction of genes and environment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet even today, Galton’s influence lives on in the field of behavioral genetics, which investigates the genetic roots of psychological traits. Starting in the 1960s, researchers in the US began to revisit one of Galton’s favorite methods: twin studies. Many of these studies, which analyzed pairs of identical and fraternal twins to try to determine which traits were heritable and which resulted from socialization, were funded by the US government. The most well-known of these, the Minnesota Twin Study, also accepted grants from the Pioneer Fund, a now defunct nonprofit that had promoted eugenics and “race betterment” since its founding in 1937.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nature-versus-nurture debate hit a major inflection point in 2003, when the Human Genome Project was declared complete. After 13 years and at a cost of nearly $3 billion, an international consortium of thousands of researchers had sequenced 92% of the human genome for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the cost of sequencing a genome can be as low as $600, and one company says it will soon drop even further. This dramatic reduction has made it possible to build massive DNA databases like the UK Biobank and the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us, each containing genetic data from more than half a million volunteers. Resources like these have enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies, or GWASs, which identify correlations between genetic variants and human traits by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—the most common form of genetic variation between individuals. The findings from these studies serve as a reference point for developing polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most GWASs have focused on disease prevention and personalized medicine. But in 2011, a group of medical researchers, social scientists, and economists launched the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) to investigate the genetic basis of complex social and behavioral outcomes. One of the phenotypes they focused on was the level of education people reached.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of a phenotype of convenience,” explains Patrick Turley, an economist and member of the steering committee at SSGAC, given that educational attainment is routinely recorded in surveys when genetic data is collected. Still, it was “clear that genes play some role,” he says. “And trying to understand what that role is, I think, is really interesting.” He adds that social scientists can also use genetic data to try to better “understand the role that is due to &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;genetic pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the left are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work immediately stirred feelings of discomfort—not least among the consortium’s own members, who feared that they might unintentionally help reinforce racism, inequality, and genetic determinism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s also created quite a bit of discomfort in some political circles, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a psychologist and behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas in Austin, who says she has spent much of her career making the unpopular argument to fellow liberals that genes are relevant predictors of social outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harden thinks a strength of those on the left is their ability to recognize “that bodies are different from each other in a way that matters.” Many are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet, she says, heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference that impacts our life.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harden believes that genes matter for our understanding of traits like intelligence, and that this should help shape progressive policymaking. She gives the example of an education department seeking policy interventions to improve math scores in a given school district. If a polygenic risk score is “as strongly correlated with their school grades” as family income is, she says of the students in such a district, then “does deliberately not collecting that [genetic] information, or not knowing about it, make your research harder [and] your inferences worse?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Harden, persisting with this strategy of avoidance for fear of encouraging eugenicists is a mistake. If “insisting that IQ is a myth and genes have nothing to do with it was going to be successful at neutralizing eugenics,” she says, “it would’ve won by now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason these ideas are so taboo in many circles is that today’s debate around genetic determinism is still deeply infused with Galton’s ideas—and has become a particular fixation among the online right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125497" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_2.jpg?w=1389" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X) in 2022 and loosened its restrictions on hate speech, a flood of accounts started sharing racist posts, some speculating about the genetic origins of inequality while arguing against immigration and racial integration. Musk himself frequently reposts and engages with accounts like Crémieux Recueil, the pen name of independent researcher Jordan Lasker, who has written about the “Black-White IQ gap,” and i/o, an anonymous account that once praised Musk for “acknowledging data on race and crime,” saying it “has done more to raise awareness of the disproportionalities observed in these data than anything I can remember.” (In response to allegations that his research encourages eugenics, Lasker wrote to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “The popular understanding of eugenics is about coercion and cutting people cast as ‘undesirable’ out of the breeding pool. This is nothing like that, so it doesn’t qualify as eugenics by that popular understanding of the term.” After going to print, i/o wrote&amp;nbsp;in an email,&amp;nbsp;“Just because differences in intelligence at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;level are largely heritable, it does not mean that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;differences in measured intelligence ... are due to genetic differences between groups,”&amp;nbsp;but that the latter is not “scientifically settled” and&amp;nbsp;“an extremely important (and necessary) research area that should be funded rather than made taboo.”&amp;nbsp;He added,&amp;nbsp;“I’ve never made any argument against racial integration or intermarriage or whatever.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Harden, though, warns against discounting the work of an entire field because of a few noisy neoreactionaries. “I think there can be this idea that technology is giving rise to the terrible racism,” she says. The truth, she believes, is that “the racism has preexisted any of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, a company called Genomic Prediction began to offer the first preimplantation polygenic testing that had ever been made commercially available. With its LifeView Embryo Health Score, prospective parents are able to assess their embryos’ predisposition to genetically complex health problems like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Pricing for the service starts at $3,500. Genomic Prediction uses a technique called an SNP array, which targets specific sites in the genome where common variants occur. The results are then cross-checked against GWASs that show correlations between genetic variants and certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, a company named Orchid began offering a competing test. Orchid’s Whole Genome Embryo Report distinguished itself by claiming to sequence more than 99% of an embryo’s genome, allowing it to detect novel mutations and, the company says, diagnose rare diseases more accurately. For $2,500 per embryo, parents can access polygenic risk scores for 12 disorders, including schizophrenia, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid was founded by a woman named Noor Siddiqui. Before getting undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford, she was awarded the Thiel fellowship—a $200,000 grant given to young entrepreneurs willing to work on their ideas instead of going to college—back when she was a teenager, in 2012. This set her up to attract attention from members of the tech elite as both customers and financial backers. Her company has raised $16.5 million to date from investors like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August Siddiqui made the controversial suggestion that parents who choose not to use genetic testing might be considered irresponsible. “Just be honest: you’re okay with your kid potentially suffering for life so you can feel morally superior …” she wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Americans have varied opinions on the emerging technology. In 2024, a group of bioethicists surveyed 1,627 US adults to determine attitudes toward a variety of polygenic testing criteria. A large majority approved of testing for physical health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Screening for mental health disorders, like depression, OCD, and ADHD, drew a more mixed—but still positive—response. Appearance-related traits, like skin color, baldness, and height, received less approval as something to test for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence was among the most contentious traits—unsurprising given the way it has been weaponized throughout history and the lack of cultural consensus on how it should even be defined. (In many countries, intelligence testing for embryos is heavily regulated; in the UK, the practice is banned outright.) In the 2024 survey, 36.9% of respondents approved of preimplantation genetic testing for intelligence, 40.5% disapproved, and 22.6% said they were uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125500" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-feature_baby.png?w=589" width="589" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the disagreement, intelligence has been among the traits most talked about as targets for testing. From early on, Genomic Prediction says, it began receiving inquiries “from all over the world” about testing for intelligence, according to Diego Marin, the company’s head of global business development and scientific affairs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At one time, the company offered a predictor for what it called “intellectual disability.” After some backlash questioning both the predictive capacity and the ethics of these scores, the company discontinued the feature. “Our mission and vision of this company is not to improve [a baby], but to reduce risk for disease,” Marin told me. “When it comes to traits about IQ or skin color or height or something that’s cosmetic and doesn’t really have a connotation of a disease, then we just don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid, on the other hand, does test for genetic markers associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay. But that may not be all. According to one employee of the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intelligence testing is also offered to “high-roller” clients. According to this employee, another source close to the company, and reporting in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; Musk used Orchid’s services in the conception of at least one of the children he shares with the tech executive Shivon Zilis. (Orchid, Musk, and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I met Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder of New York–based Nucleus Genomics, on a sweltering July afternoon in his SoHo office. Slight and kinetic, Sadeghi spoke at a machine-gun pace, pausing only occasionally to ask if I was keeping up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi had modified his first organism—a sample of brewer’s yeast—at the age of 16. As a high schooler in 2016, he was taking a course on CRISPR-Cas9 at a Brooklyn laboratory when he fell in love with the “beautiful depth” of genetics. Just a few years later, he dropped out of college to build “a better 23andMe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company targets what you might call the application layer of PGT-P, accepting data from IVF clinics—and even from the competitors mentioned in this story—and running its own computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike a lot of the other testing companies, we’re software first, and we’re consumer first,” Sadeghi told me. “It’s not enough to give someone a polygenic score. What does that mean? How do you compare them? There’s so many really hard design problems.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like its competitors, Nucleus calculates its polygenic risk scores by comparing an individual’s genetic data with trait-associated variants identified in large GWASs, providing statistically informed predictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus provides two displays of a patient’s results: a Z-score, plotted from –4 to 4, which explains the risk of a certain trait relative to a population with similar genetic ancestry (for example, if Embryo #3 has a 2.1 Z-score for breast cancer, its risk is higher than average), and an absolute risk score, which includes relevant clinical factors (Embryo #3 has a minuscule actual risk of breast cancer, given that it is male).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real difference between Nucleus and its competitors lies in the breadth of what it claims to offer clients. On its sleek website, prospective parents can sort through more than 2,000 possible diseases, as well as traits from eye color to IQ. Access to the Nucleus Embryo platform costs $8,999, while the company’s new IVF+ offering—which includes one IVF cycle with a partner clinic, embryo screening for up to 20 embryos, and concierge services throughout the process—starts at $24,999.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” Nucleus founder Kian Sadeghi said at a June event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its promises are remarkably bold. The company claims to be able to forecast a propensity for anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and other mental issues. It says you can see which of your embryos are more likely to have alcohol dependence, which are more likely to be left-handed, and which might end up with severe acne or seasonal allergies. (Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the embryo-screening platform provided this disclaimer: “DNA is not destiny. Genetics can be a helpful tool for choosing an embryo, but it’s not a guarantee. Genetic research is still in it’s [sic] infancy, and there’s still a lot we don’t know about how DNA shapes who we are.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To people accustomed to sleep trackers, biohacking supplements, and glucose monitoring, taking advantage of Nucleus’s options might seem like a no-brainer. To anyone who welcomes a bit of serendipity in their life, this level of perceived control may be disconcerting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi likes to frame his arguments in terms of personal choice. “Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” he told a small audience at Nucleus Embryo’s June launch event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the official launch day, Sadeghi spent hours gleefully sparring with X users who accused him of practicing eugenics. He rejects the term, favoring instead “genetic optimization”—though it seems he wasn’t too upset about the free viral marketing. “This week we got five million impressions on Twitter,” he told a crowd at the launch event, to a smattering of applause. (In an email to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review, &lt;/em&gt;Sadeghi wrote, “The history of eugenics is one of coercion and discrimination by states and institutions; what Nucleus does is the opposite—genetic forecasting that empowers individuals to make informed decisions.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus has raised more than $36 million from investors like Srinivasan, Alexis Ohanian’s venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, and Thiel’s Founders Fund. (Like Siddiqui, Sadeghi was a recipient of a Thiel fellowship when he dropped out of college; a representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Sadeghi has even poached Genomic Prediction’s cofounder Nathan Treff, who is now Nucleus’s chief clinical officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi’s real goal is to build a one-stop shop for every possible application of genetic sequencing technology, from genealogy to precision medicine to genetic engineering. He names a handful of companies providing these services, with a combined market cap in the billions. “Nucleus is collapsing all five of these companies into one,” he says. “We are not an IVF testing company. We are a genetic stack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spring, I elbowed my way into a packed hotel bar in the Flatiron district, where over a hundred people had gathered to hear a talk called “How to create SUPERBABIES.” The event was part of New York’s Deep Tech Week, so I expected to meet a smattering of biotech professionals and investors. Instead, I was surprised to encounter a diverse and curious group of creatives, software engineers, students, and prospective parents—many of whom had come with no previous knowledge of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The speaker that evening was Jonathan Anomaly, a soft-spoken political philosopher whose didactic tone betrays his years as a university professor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of Anomaly’s academic work has focused on developing theories of rational behavior. At Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, he led introductory courses on game theory, ethics, and collective action problems as well as bioethics, digging into thorny questions about abortion, vaccines, and euthanasia. But perhaps no topic has interested him so much as the emerging field of genetic enhancement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, in a bioethics journal, Anomaly published a paper with the intentionally provocative title “Defending Eugenics.” He sought to distinguish what he called “positive eugenics”—noncoercive methods aimed at increasing traits that “promote individual and social welfare”—from the so-called “negative eugenics” we know from our history books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly likes to argue that embryo selection isn’t all that different from practices we already take for granted. Don’t believe two cousins should be allowed to have children? Perhaps you’re a eugenicist, he contends. Your friend who picked out a six-foot-two Harvard grad from a binder of potential sperm donors? Same logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His hiring at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 caused outrage among some students, who accused him of “racial essentialism.” In 2020, Anomaly left academia, lamenting that “American universities had become an intellectual prison.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Anomaly joined a nascent PGT-P company named Herasight, which was promising to screen for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the end of July, the company officially emerged from stealth mode. A representative told me that most of the money raised so far is from angel investors, including Srinivasan, who also invested in Orchid and Nucleus. According to the launch announcement on X, Herasight has screened “hundreds of embryos” for private customers and is beginning to offer its first publicly available consumer product, a polygenic assessment that claims to detect an embryo’s likelihood of developing 17 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their marketing materials boast predictive abilities 122% better than Orchid’s and 193% better than Genomic Prediction’s for this set of diseases. (“Herasight is comparing their current predictor to models we published over five years ago,” Genomic Prediction responded in a statement. “Our team is confident our predictors are world-class and are not exceeded in quality by any other lab.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company did not include comparisons with Nucleus, pointing to the “absence of published performance validations” by that company and claiming it represented a case where “marketing outpaces science.” (“Nucleus is known for world-class science and marketing, and we understand why that’s frustrating to our competitors,” a representative from the company responded in a comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight also emphasized new advances in “within-family validation” (making sure that the scores are not merely picking up shared environmental factors by comparing their performance between unrelated people to their performance between siblings) and “cross-­ancestry accuracy” (improving the accuracy of scores for people outside the European ancestry groups where most of the biobank data is concentrated). The representative explained that pricing varies by customer and the number of embryos tested, but it can reach $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to traits that Jonathan Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, violence, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight tests for just one non-disease-related trait: intelligence. For a couple who produce 10 embryos, it claims it can detect an IQ spread of about 15 points, from the lowest-scoring embryo to the highest. The representative says the company plans to release a detailed white paper on its IQ predictor in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day of Herasight’s launch, Musk responded to the company announcement: “Cool.” Meanwhile, a Danish researcher named Emil Kirkegaard, whose research has largely focused on IQ differences between racial groups, boosted the company to his nearly 45,000 followers on X (as well as in a Substack blog), writing, “Proper embryo selection just landed.” Kirkegaard has in fact supported Anomaly’s work for years; he’s posted about him on X and recommended his 2020 book &lt;em&gt;Creating Future People,&lt;/em&gt; which he called a “biotech eugenics advocacy book,” adding: “Naturally, I agree with this stuff!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to traits that Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence—which he claimed in his talk is about 75% heritable—is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, impulse control, violence, passivity, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly concedes there are limitations to the kinds of relative predictions that can be made from a small batch of embryos. But he believes we’re only at the dawn of what he likes to call the “reproductive revolution.” At his talk, he pointed to a technology currently in development at a handful of startups: in vitro gametogenesis. IVG aims to create sperm or egg cells in a laboratory using adult stem cells, genetically reprogrammed from cells found in a sample of skin or blood. In theory, this process could allow a couple to quickly produce a practically unlimited number of embryos to analyze for preferred traits. Anomaly predicted this technology could be ready to use on humans within eight years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125510" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_3_1.jpg?w=1617" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I doubt the FDA will allow it immediately. That’s what places like Próspera are for,” he said, referring to the so-called “startup city” in Honduras, where scientists and entrepreneurs can conduct medical experiments free from the kinds of regulatory oversight they’d encounter in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You might have a moral intuition that this is wrong,” said Anomaly, “but when it’s discovered that elites are doing it privately … the dominoes are going to fall very, very quickly.” The coming “evolutionary arms race,” he claimed, will “change the moral landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that some of those elites are his own customers: “I could already name names, but I won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Anomaly’s talk was over, I spoke with a young photographer who told me he was hoping to pursue a master’s degree in theology. He came to the event, he told me, to reckon with the ethical implications of playing God. “Technology is sending us toward an Old-to-New-Testament transition moment, where we have to decide what parts of religion still serve us,” he said soberly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criticisms of polygenic testing tend to fall into two camps: skepticism about the tests’ effectiveness and concerns about their ethics. “On one hand,” says Turley from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, “you have arguments saying ‘This isn’t going to work anyway, and the reason it’s bad is because we’re tricking parents, which would be a problem.’ And on the other hand, they say, ‘Oh, this is going to work so well that it’s going to lead to enormous inequalities in society.’ It’s just funny to see. Sometimes these arguments are being made by the same people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of those people is Sasha Gusev, who runs a quantitative genetics lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A vocal critic of PGT-P for embryo selection, he also often engages in online debates with the far-right accounts promoting race science on X.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gusev is one of many professionals in his field who believe that because of numerous confounding socioeconomic factors—for example, childhood nutrition, geography, personal networks, and parenting styles—there isn’t much point in trying to trace outcomes like educational attainment back to genetics, particularly not as a way to prove that there’s a genetic basis for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds, “I think there’s a real risk in moving toward a society where you see genetics and ‘genetic endowments’ as the drivers of people’s behavior and as a ceiling on their outcomes and their capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev thinks there is real promise for this technology in clinical settings among specific adult populations. For adults identified as having high polygenic risk scores for cancer and cardiovascular disease, he argues, a combination of early screening and intervention could be lifesaving. But when it comes to the preimplantation testing currently on the market, he thinks there are significant limitations—and few regulatory measures or long-term validation methods to check the promises companies are making. He fears that giving these services too much attention could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These reckless, overpromised, and oftentimes just straight-up manipulative embryo selection applications are a risk for the credibility and the utility of these clinical tools,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many IVF patients have also had strong reactions to publicity around PGT-P. When the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published an opinion piece about Orchid in the spring, angry parents took to Reddit to rant. One user posted, “For people who dont [sic] know why other types of testing are necessary or needed this just makes IVF people sound like we want to create ‘perfect’ babies, while we just want (our) healthy babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, others defended the need for a conversation. “When could technologies like this change the mission from helping infertile people have healthy babies to eugenics?” one Redditor posted. “It’s a fine line to walk and an important discussion to have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some PGT-P proponents, like Kirkegaard and Anomaly, have argued that policy decisions should more explicitly account for genetic differences. In a series of blog posts following the 2024 presidential election, under the header “Make science great again,” Kirkegaard called for ending affirmative action laws, legalizing race-based hiring discrimination, and removing restrictions on data sets like the NIH’s All of Us biobank that prevent researchers like him from using the data for race science. Anomaly has criticized social welfare policies for putting a finger on the scale to “punish the high-IQ people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the notion of genetic determinism has gained some traction among loyalists to President Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Trump himself made a campaign stop on the conservative radio program &lt;em&gt;The Hugh Hewitt Show. &lt;/em&gt;He began a rambling answer about immigration and homicide statistics. “A murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,” he told the host.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev believes that while embryo selection won’t have much impact on individual outcomes, the intellectual framework endorsed by many PGT-P advocates could have dire social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you just think of the differences that we observe in society as being cultural, then you help people out. You give them better schooling, you give them better nutrition and education, and they’re able to excel,” he says. “If you think of these differences as being strongly innate, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there’s nothing that can be done and people just are what they are at birth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the time being, there are no plans for longitudinal studies to track &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; outcomes for the humans these companies have helped bring into the world. Harden, the behavioral geneticist from UT Austin, suspects that 25 years down the line, adults who were once embryos selected on the basis of polygenic risk scores are “going to end up with the same question that we all have.” They will look at their life and wonder, “What would’ve had to change for it to be different?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia Black is a Brooklyn-based features writer and a reporter in residence at Omidyar Network.

This bundle of cells, about the size of a grain of sand pulled from a powdery white Caribbean beach, contains the coiled potential of a future life: 46 chromosomes, thousands of genes, and roughly six billion base pairs of DNA—an instruction manual to assemble a one-of-a-kind human.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst’s outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become. Some parents turn to these tests to avoid passing on devastating genetic disorders that run in their families. A much smaller group, driven by dreams of Ivy League diplomas or attractive, well-behaved offspring, are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to optimize for intelligence, appearance, and personality. Some of the most eager early boosters of this technology are members of the Silicon Valley elite, including tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But customers of the companies emerging to provide it to the public may not be getting what they’re paying for. Genetics experts have been highlighting the potential deficiencies of this testing for years. A 2021 paper by members of the European Society of Human Genetics said, “No clinical research has been performed to assess its diagnostic effectiveness in embryos. Patients need to be properly informed on the limitations of this use.” And a paper published this May in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; echoed this concern and expressed particular reservations about screening for psychiatric disorders and non-­disease-related traits: “Unfortunately, no clinical research has to date been published comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy [of predictive testing]. Patient awareness regarding the limitations of this procedure is paramount.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the assumptions underlying some of this work—that how a person turns out is the product not of privilege or circumstance but of innate biology—have made these companies a political lightning rod.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125496" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_1.jpg?w=1388" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;As this niche technology begins to make its way toward the mainstream, scientists and ethicists are racing to confront the implications—for our social contract, for future generations, and for our very understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), while still relatively rare, is not new. Since the 1990s, parents undergoing in vitro fertilization have been able to access a number of genetic tests before choosing which embryo to use. A type known as PGT-M can detect single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. PGT-A can ascertain the sex of an embryo and identify chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to conditions like Down syndrome or reduce the chances that an embryo will implant successfully in the uterus. PGT-SR helps parents avoid embryos with issues such as duplicated or missing segments of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those tests all identify clear-cut genetic problems that are relatively easy to detect, but most of the genetic instruction manual included in an embryo is written in far more nuanced code. In recent years, a fledgling market has sprung up around a new, more advanced version of the testing process called PGT-P: preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders (and, some claim, traits)—that is, outcomes determined by the elaborate interaction of hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the first baby selected using PGT-P was born. While the exact figure is unknown, estimates put the number of children who have now been born with the aid of this technology in the hundreds. As the technology is commercialized, that number is likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Embryo selection is less like a build-a-baby workshop and more akin to a store where parents can shop for their future children from several available models—complete with stat cards indicating their predispositions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A handful of startups, armed with tens of millions of dollars of Silicon Valley cash, have developed proprietary algorithms to compute these stats—analyzing vast numbers of genetic variants and producing a “polygenic risk score” that shows the probability of an embryo developing a variety of complex traits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the last five years or so, two companies—Genomic Prediction and Orchid—have dominated this small landscape, focusing their efforts on disease prevention. But more recently, two splashy new competitors have emerged: Nucleus Genomics and Herasight, which have rejected the more cautious approach of their predecessors and waded into the controversial territory of genetic testing for intelligence. (Nucleus also offers tests for a wide variety of other behavioral and appearance-related traits.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The practical limitations of polygenic risk scores are substantial. For starters, there is still a lot we don’t understand about the complex gene interactions driving polygenic traits and disorders. And the biobank data sets they are based on tend to overwhelmingly represent individuals with Western European ancestry, making it more difficult to generate reliable scores for patients from other backgrounds. These scores also lack the full context of environment, lifestyle, and the myriad other factors that can influence a person’s characteristics. And while polygenic risk scores can be effective at detecting large, population-level trends, their predictive abilities drop significantly when the sample size is as tiny as a single batch of embryos that share much of the same DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medical community—including organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine—is generally wary of using polygenic risk scores for embryo selection. “The practice has moved too fast with too little evidence,” the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics wrote in an official statement in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But beyond questions of whether evidence supports the technology’s effectiveness, critics of the companies selling it accuse them of reviving a disturbing ideology: eugenics, or the belief that selective breeding can be used to improve humanity. Indeed, some of the voices who have been most confident that these methods can successfully predict nondisease traits have made startling claims about natural genetic hierarchies and innate racial differences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What everyone can agree on, though, is that this new wave of technology is helping to inflame a centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “eugenics” was coined in 1883 by a British anthropologist and statistician named Sir Francis Galton, inspired in part by the work of his cousin Charles Darwin. He derived it from a Greek word meaning “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of modern history’s darkest chapters have been built on Galton’s legacy, from the Holocaust to the forced sterilization laws that affected certain groups in the United States well into the 20th century. Modern science has demonstrated the many logical and empirical problems with Galton’s methodology. (For starters, he counted vague concepts like “eminence”—as well as infections like syphilis and tuberculosis—as heritable phenotypes, meaning characteristics that result from the interaction of genes and environment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet even today, Galton’s influence lives on in the field of behavioral genetics, which investigates the genetic roots of psychological traits. Starting in the 1960s, researchers in the US began to revisit one of Galton’s favorite methods: twin studies. Many of these studies, which analyzed pairs of identical and fraternal twins to try to determine which traits were heritable and which resulted from socialization, were funded by the US government. The most well-known of these, the Minnesota Twin Study, also accepted grants from the Pioneer Fund, a now defunct nonprofit that had promoted eugenics and “race betterment” since its founding in 1937.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nature-versus-nurture debate hit a major inflection point in 2003, when the Human Genome Project was declared complete. After 13 years and at a cost of nearly $3 billion, an international consortium of thousands of researchers had sequenced 92% of the human genome for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the cost of sequencing a genome can be as low as $600, and one company says it will soon drop even further. This dramatic reduction has made it possible to build massive DNA databases like the UK Biobank and the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us, each containing genetic data from more than half a million volunteers. Resources like these have enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies, or GWASs, which identify correlations between genetic variants and human traits by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—the most common form of genetic variation between individuals. The findings from these studies serve as a reference point for developing polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most GWASs have focused on disease prevention and personalized medicine. But in 2011, a group of medical researchers, social scientists, and economists launched the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC) to investigate the genetic basis of complex social and behavioral outcomes. One of the phenotypes they focused on was the level of education people reached.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of a phenotype of convenience,” explains Patrick Turley, an economist and member of the steering committee at SSGAC, given that educational attainment is routinely recorded in surveys when genetic data is collected. Still, it was “clear that genes play some role,” he says. “And trying to understand what that role is, I think, is really interesting.” He adds that social scientists can also use genetic data to try to better “understand the role that is due to &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;genetic pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many on the left are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work immediately stirred feelings of discomfort—not least among the consortium’s own members, who feared that they might unintentionally help reinforce racism, inequality, and genetic determinism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s also created quite a bit of discomfort in some political circles, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a psychologist and behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas in Austin, who says she has spent much of her career making the unpopular argument to fellow liberals that genes are relevant predictors of social outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Harden thinks a strength of those on the left is their ability to recognize “that bodies are different from each other in a way that matters.” Many are generally willing to allow that any number of traits, from addiction to obesity, are genetically influenced. Yet, she says, heritable cognitive ability seems to be “beyond the pale for us to integrate as a source of difference that impacts our life.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harden believes that genes matter for our understanding of traits like intelligence, and that this should help shape progressive policymaking. She gives the example of an education department seeking policy interventions to improve math scores in a given school district. If a polygenic risk score is “as strongly correlated with their school grades” as family income is, she says of the students in such a district, then “does deliberately not collecting that [genetic] information, or not knowing about it, make your research harder [and] your inferences worse?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Harden, persisting with this strategy of avoidance for fear of encouraging eugenicists is a mistake. If “insisting that IQ is a myth and genes have nothing to do with it was going to be successful at neutralizing eugenics,” she says, “it would’ve won by now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason these ideas are so taboo in many circles is that today’s debate around genetic determinism is still deeply infused with Galton’s ideas—and has become a particular fixation among the online right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125497" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_2.jpg?w=1389" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X) in 2022 and loosened its restrictions on hate speech, a flood of accounts started sharing racist posts, some speculating about the genetic origins of inequality while arguing against immigration and racial integration. Musk himself frequently reposts and engages with accounts like Crémieux Recueil, the pen name of independent researcher Jordan Lasker, who has written about the “Black-White IQ gap,” and i/o, an anonymous account that once praised Musk for “acknowledging data on race and crime,” saying it “has done more to raise awareness of the disproportionalities observed in these data than anything I can remember.” (In response to allegations that his research encourages eugenics, Lasker wrote to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “The popular understanding of eugenics is about coercion and cutting people cast as ‘undesirable’ out of the breeding pool. This is nothing like that, so it doesn’t qualify as eugenics by that popular understanding of the term.” After going to print, i/o wrote&amp;nbsp;in an email,&amp;nbsp;“Just because differences in intelligence at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;level are largely heritable, it does not mean that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;differences in measured intelligence ... are due to genetic differences between groups,”&amp;nbsp;but that the latter is not “scientifically settled” and&amp;nbsp;“an extremely important (and necessary) research area that should be funded rather than made taboo.”&amp;nbsp;He added,&amp;nbsp;“I’ve never made any argument against racial integration or intermarriage or whatever.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Harden, though, warns against discounting the work of an entire field because of a few noisy neoreactionaries. “I think there can be this idea that technology is giving rise to the terrible racism,” she says. The truth, she believes, is that “the racism has preexisted any of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, a company called Genomic Prediction began to offer the first preimplantation polygenic testing that had ever been made commercially available. With its LifeView Embryo Health Score, prospective parents are able to assess their embryos’ predisposition to genetically complex health problems like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Pricing for the service starts at $3,500. Genomic Prediction uses a technique called an SNP array, which targets specific sites in the genome where common variants occur. The results are then cross-checked against GWASs that show correlations between genetic variants and certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, a company named Orchid began offering a competing test. Orchid’s Whole Genome Embryo Report distinguished itself by claiming to sequence more than 99% of an embryo’s genome, allowing it to detect novel mutations and, the company says, diagnose rare diseases more accurately. For $2,500 per embryo, parents can access polygenic risk scores for 12 disorders, including schizophrenia, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid was founded by a woman named Noor Siddiqui. Before getting undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford, she was awarded the Thiel fellowship—a $200,000 grant given to young entrepreneurs willing to work on their ideas instead of going to college—back when she was a teenager, in 2012. This set her up to attract attention from members of the tech elite as both customers and financial backers. Her company has raised $16.5 million to date from investors like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August Siddiqui made the controversial suggestion that parents who choose not to use genetic testing might be considered irresponsible. “Just be honest: you’re okay with your kid potentially suffering for life so you can feel morally superior …” she wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Americans have varied opinions on the emerging technology. In 2024, a group of bioethicists surveyed 1,627 US adults to determine attitudes toward a variety of polygenic testing criteria. A large majority approved of testing for physical health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Screening for mental health disorders, like depression, OCD, and ADHD, drew a more mixed—but still positive—response. Appearance-related traits, like skin color, baldness, and height, received less approval as something to test for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence was among the most contentious traits—unsurprising given the way it has been weaponized throughout history and the lack of cultural consensus on how it should even be defined. (In many countries, intelligence testing for embryos is heavily regulated; in the UK, the practice is banned outright.) In the 2024 survey, 36.9% of respondents approved of preimplantation genetic testing for intelligence, 40.5% disapproved, and 22.6% said they were uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125500" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-feature_baby.png?w=589" width="589" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the disagreement, intelligence has been among the traits most talked about as targets for testing. From early on, Genomic Prediction says, it began receiving inquiries “from all over the world” about testing for intelligence, according to Diego Marin, the company’s head of global business development and scientific affairs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At one time, the company offered a predictor for what it called “intellectual disability.” After some backlash questioning both the predictive capacity and the ethics of these scores, the company discontinued the feature. “Our mission and vision of this company is not to improve [a baby], but to reduce risk for disease,” Marin told me. “When it comes to traits about IQ or skin color or height or something that’s cosmetic and doesn’t really have a connotation of a disease, then we just don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Orchid, on the other hand, does test for genetic markers associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay. But that may not be all. According to one employee of the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intelligence testing is also offered to “high-roller” clients. According to this employee, another source close to the company, and reporting in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; Musk used Orchid’s services in the conception of at least one of the children he shares with the tech executive Shivon Zilis. (Orchid, Musk, and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I met Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder of New York–based Nucleus Genomics, on a sweltering July afternoon in his SoHo office. Slight and kinetic, Sadeghi spoke at a machine-gun pace, pausing only occasionally to ask if I was keeping up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi had modified his first organism—a sample of brewer’s yeast—at the age of 16. As a high schooler in 2016, he was taking a course on CRISPR-Cas9 at a Brooklyn laboratory when he fell in love with the “beautiful depth” of genetics. Just a few years later, he dropped out of college to build “a better 23andMe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company targets what you might call the application layer of PGT-P, accepting data from IVF clinics—and even from the competitors mentioned in this story—and running its own computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike a lot of the other testing companies, we’re software first, and we’re consumer first,” Sadeghi told me. “It’s not enough to give someone a polygenic score. What does that mean? How do you compare them? There’s so many really hard design problems.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like its competitors, Nucleus calculates its polygenic risk scores by comparing an individual’s genetic data with trait-associated variants identified in large GWASs, providing statistically informed predictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus provides two displays of a patient’s results: a Z-score, plotted from –4 to 4, which explains the risk of a certain trait relative to a population with similar genetic ancestry (for example, if Embryo #3 has a 2.1 Z-score for breast cancer, its risk is higher than average), and an absolute risk score, which includes relevant clinical factors (Embryo #3 has a minuscule actual risk of breast cancer, given that it is male).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real difference between Nucleus and its competitors lies in the breadth of what it claims to offer clients. On its sleek website, prospective parents can sort through more than 2,000 possible diseases, as well as traits from eye color to IQ. Access to the Nucleus Embryo platform costs $8,999, while the company’s new IVF+ offering—which includes one IVF cycle with a partner clinic, embryo screening for up to 20 embryos, and concierge services throughout the process—starts at $24,999.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” Nucleus founder Kian Sadeghi said at a June event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its promises are remarkably bold. The company claims to be able to forecast a propensity for anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, and other mental issues. It says you can see which of your embryos are more likely to have alcohol dependence, which are more likely to be left-handed, and which might end up with severe acne or seasonal allergies. (Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the embryo-screening platform provided this disclaimer: “DNA is not destiny. Genetics can be a helpful tool for choosing an embryo, but it’s not a guarantee. Genetic research is still in it’s [sic] infancy, and there’s still a lot we don’t know about how DNA shapes who we are.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To people accustomed to sleep trackers, biohacking supplements, and glucose monitoring, taking advantage of Nucleus’s options might seem like a no-brainer. To anyone who welcomes a bit of serendipity in their life, this level of perceived control may be disconcerting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi likes to frame his arguments in terms of personal choice. “Maybe you want your baby to have blue eyes versus green eyes,” he told a small audience at Nucleus Embryo’s June launch event. “That is up to the liberty of the parents.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the official launch day, Sadeghi spent hours gleefully sparring with X users who accused him of practicing eugenics. He rejects the term, favoring instead “genetic optimization”—though it seems he wasn’t too upset about the free viral marketing. “This week we got five million impressions on Twitter,” he told a crowd at the launch event, to a smattering of applause. (In an email to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review, &lt;/em&gt;Sadeghi wrote, “The history of eugenics is one of coercion and discrimination by states and institutions; what Nucleus does is the opposite—genetic forecasting that empowers individuals to make informed decisions.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nucleus has raised more than $36 million from investors like Srinivasan, Alexis Ohanian’s venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, and Thiel’s Founders Fund. (Like Siddiqui, Sadeghi was a recipient of a Thiel fellowship when he dropped out of college; a representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) Sadeghi has even poached Genomic Prediction’s cofounder Nathan Treff, who is now Nucleus’s chief clinical officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadeghi’s real goal is to build a one-stop shop for every possible application of genetic sequencing technology, from genealogy to precision medicine to genetic engineering. He names a handful of companies providing these services, with a combined market cap in the billions. “Nucleus is collapsing all five of these companies into one,” he says. “We are not an IVF testing company. We are a genetic stack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spring, I elbowed my way into a packed hotel bar in the Flatiron district, where over a hundred people had gathered to hear a talk called “How to create SUPERBABIES.” The event was part of New York’s Deep Tech Week, so I expected to meet a smattering of biotech professionals and investors. Instead, I was surprised to encounter a diverse and curious group of creatives, software engineers, students, and prospective parents—many of whom had come with no previous knowledge of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The speaker that evening was Jonathan Anomaly, a soft-spoken political philosopher whose didactic tone betrays his years as a university professor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of Anomaly’s academic work has focused on developing theories of rational behavior. At Duke and the University of Pennsylvania, he led introductory courses on game theory, ethics, and collective action problems as well as bioethics, digging into thorny questions about abortion, vaccines, and euthanasia. But perhaps no topic has interested him so much as the emerging field of genetic enhancement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, in a bioethics journal, Anomaly published a paper with the intentionally provocative title “Defending Eugenics.” He sought to distinguish what he called “positive eugenics”—noncoercive methods aimed at increasing traits that “promote individual and social welfare”—from the so-called “negative eugenics” we know from our history books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly likes to argue that embryo selection isn’t all that different from practices we already take for granted. Don’t believe two cousins should be allowed to have children? Perhaps you’re a eugenicist, he contends. Your friend who picked out a six-foot-two Harvard grad from a binder of potential sperm donors? Same logic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His hiring at the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 caused outrage among some students, who accused him of “racial essentialism.” In 2020, Anomaly left academia, lamenting that “American universities had become an intellectual prison.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Anomaly joined a nascent PGT-P company named Herasight, which was promising to screen for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the end of July, the company officially emerged from stealth mode. A representative told me that most of the money raised so far is from angel investors, including Srinivasan, who also invested in Orchid and Nucleus. According to the launch announcement on X, Herasight has screened “hundreds of embryos” for private customers and is beginning to offer its first publicly available consumer product, a polygenic assessment that claims to detect an embryo’s likelihood of developing 17 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their marketing materials boast predictive abilities 122% better than Orchid’s and 193% better than Genomic Prediction’s for this set of diseases. (“Herasight is comparing their current predictor to models we published over five years ago,” Genomic Prediction responded in a statement. “Our team is confident our predictors are world-class and are not exceeded in quality by any other lab.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company did not include comparisons with Nucleus, pointing to the “absence of published performance validations” by that company and claiming it represented a case where “marketing outpaces science.” (“Nucleus is known for world-class science and marketing, and we understand why that’s frustrating to our competitors,” a representative from the company responded in a comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight also emphasized new advances in “within-family validation” (making sure that the scores are not merely picking up shared environmental factors by comparing their performance between unrelated people to their performance between siblings) and “cross-­ancestry accuracy” (improving the accuracy of scores for people outside the European ancestry groups where most of the biobank data is concentrated). The representative explained that pricing varies by customer and the number of embryos tested, but it can reach $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to traits that Jonathan Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, violence, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herasight tests for just one non-disease-related trait: intelligence. For a couple who produce 10 embryos, it claims it can detect an IQ spread of about 15 points, from the lowest-scoring embryo to the highest. The representative says the company plans to release a detailed white paper on its IQ predictor in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day of Herasight’s launch, Musk responded to the company announcement: “Cool.” Meanwhile, a Danish researcher named Emil Kirkegaard, whose research has largely focused on IQ differences between racial groups, boosted the company to his nearly 45,000 followers on X (as well as in a Substack blog), writing, “Proper embryo selection just landed.” Kirkegaard has in fact supported Anomaly’s work for years; he’s posted about him on X and recommended his 2020 book &lt;em&gt;Creating Future People,&lt;/em&gt; which he called a “biotech eugenics advocacy book,” adding: “Naturally, I agree with this stuff!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to traits that Anomaly believes are genetically encoded, intelligence—which he claimed in his talk is about 75% heritable—is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also spoken about the heritability of empathy, impulse control, violence, passivity, religiosity, and political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anomaly concedes there are limitations to the kinds of relative predictions that can be made from a small batch of embryos. But he believes we’re only at the dawn of what he likes to call the “reproductive revolution.” At his talk, he pointed to a technology currently in development at a handful of startups: in vitro gametogenesis. IVG aims to create sperm or egg cells in a laboratory using adult stem cells, genetically reprogrammed from cells found in a sample of skin or blood. In theory, this process could allow a couple to quickly produce a practically unlimited number of embryos to analyze for preferred traits. Anomaly predicted this technology could be ready to use on humans within eight years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125510" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MIT_FeatureSelection_Quarter_3_1.jpg?w=1617" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SELMAN DESIGN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I doubt the FDA will allow it immediately. That’s what places like Próspera are for,” he said, referring to the so-called “startup city” in Honduras, where scientists and entrepreneurs can conduct medical experiments free from the kinds of regulatory oversight they’d encounter in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You might have a moral intuition that this is wrong,” said Anomaly, “but when it’s discovered that elites are doing it privately … the dominoes are going to fall very, very quickly.” The coming “evolutionary arms race,” he claimed, will “change the moral landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that some of those elites are his own customers: “I could already name names, but I won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Anomaly’s talk was over, I spoke with a young photographer who told me he was hoping to pursue a master’s degree in theology. He came to the event, he told me, to reckon with the ethical implications of playing God. “Technology is sending us toward an Old-to-New-Testament transition moment, where we have to decide what parts of religion still serve us,” he said soberly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Criticisms of polygenic testing tend to fall into two camps: skepticism about the tests’ effectiveness and concerns about their ethics. “On one hand,” says Turley from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, “you have arguments saying ‘This isn’t going to work anyway, and the reason it’s bad is because we’re tricking parents, which would be a problem.’ And on the other hand, they say, ‘Oh, this is going to work so well that it’s going to lead to enormous inequalities in society.’ It’s just funny to see. Sometimes these arguments are being made by the same people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of those people is Sasha Gusev, who runs a quantitative genetics lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. A vocal critic of PGT-P for embryo selection, he also often engages in online debates with the far-right accounts promoting race science on X.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gusev is one of many professionals in his field who believe that because of numerous confounding socioeconomic factors—for example, childhood nutrition, geography, personal networks, and parenting styles—there isn’t much point in trying to trace outcomes like educational attainment back to genetics, particularly not as a way to prove that there’s a genetic basis for IQ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds, “I think there’s a real risk in moving toward a society where you see genetics and ‘genetic endowments’ as the drivers of people’s behavior and as a ceiling on their outcomes and their capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev thinks there is real promise for this technology in clinical settings among specific adult populations. For adults identified as having high polygenic risk scores for cancer and cardiovascular disease, he argues, a combination of early screening and intervention could be lifesaving. But when it comes to the preimplantation testing currently on the market, he thinks there are significant limitations—and few regulatory measures or long-term validation methods to check the promises companies are making. He fears that giving these services too much attention could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These reckless, overpromised, and oftentimes just straight-up manipulative embryo selection applications are a risk for the credibility and the utility of these clinical tools,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many IVF patients have also had strong reactions to publicity around PGT-P. When the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published an opinion piece about Orchid in the spring, angry parents took to Reddit to rant. One user posted, “For people who dont [sic] know why other types of testing are necessary or needed this just makes IVF people sound like we want to create ‘perfect’ babies, while we just want (our) healthy babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, others defended the need for a conversation. “When could technologies like this change the mission from helping infertile people have healthy babies to eugenics?” one Redditor posted. “It’s a fine line to walk and an important discussion to have.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some PGT-P proponents, like Kirkegaard and Anomaly, have argued that policy decisions should more explicitly account for genetic differences. In a series of blog posts following the 2024 presidential election, under the header “Make science great again,” Kirkegaard called for ending affirmative action laws, legalizing race-based hiring discrimination, and removing restrictions on data sets like the NIH’s All of Us biobank that prevent researchers like him from using the data for race science. Anomaly has criticized social welfare policies for putting a finger on the scale to “punish the high-IQ people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the notion of genetic determinism has gained some traction among loyalists to President Donald Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Trump himself made a campaign stop on the conservative radio program &lt;em&gt;The Hugh Hewitt Show. &lt;/em&gt;He began a rambling answer about immigration and homicide statistics. “A murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,” he told the host.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gusev believes that while embryo selection won’t have much impact on individual outcomes, the intellectual framework endorsed by many PGT-P advocates could have dire social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you just think of the differences that we observe in society as being cultural, then you help people out. You give them better schooling, you give them better nutrition and education, and they’re able to excel,” he says. “If you think of these differences as being strongly innate, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there’s nothing that can be done and people just are what they are at birth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the time being, there are no plans for longitudinal studies to track &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; outcomes for the humans these companies have helped bring into the world. Harden, the behavioral geneticist from UT Austin, suspects that 25 years down the line, adults who were once embryos selected on the basis of polygenic risk scores are “going to end up with the same question that we all have.” They will look at their life and wonder, “What would’ve had to change for it to be different?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia Black is a Brooklyn-based features writer and a reporter in residence at Omidyar Network.

You rely on the sun for power, heat your home with a woodstove, and farm your own fish and vegetables. The year is 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the life of Marcin Jakubowski, the 53-year-old founder of Open Source Ecology, an open collaborative of engineers, producers, and builders developing what they call the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). It’s a set of 50 machines—everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker—that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the “prosperity of technology” was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a bachelor’s degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school. While his peers kick-started their shiny new corporate careers, he followed a different path after he finished his degree in 2003: He bought a tractor to start a farm in Maysville, Missouri, eager to prove his ideas about abundance. “It was a clear decision to give up the office cubicle or high-level research job, which is so focused on tiny issues that one never gets to work on the big picture,” he says. But in just a short few months, his tractor broke down—and he soon went broke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Every time his tractor malfunctioned, he had no choice but to pay John Deere for repairs—even if he knew how to fix the problem on his own. John Deere, the world’s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, continues to prohibit farmers from repairing their own tractors (except in Colorado, where farmers were granted a right to repair by state law in 2023). Fixing your own tractor voids any insurance or warranty, much like jailbreaking your iPhone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, large agricultural manufacturers have centralized control over the market, and most commercial tractors are built with proprietary parts. Every year, farmers pay $1.2 billion in repair costs and lose an estimated $3 billion whenever their tractors break down, entirely because large agricultural manufacturers have lobbied against the right to repair since the ’90s. Currently there are class action lawsuits involving hundreds of farmers fighting for their right to do so.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The machines own farmers. The farmers don’t own [the machines],” Jakubowski says. He grew certain that self-sufficiency relied on agricultural autonomy, which could be achieved only through free access to technology. So he set out to apply the principles of open-source software to hardware. He figured that if farmers could have access to the instructions and materials required to build their own tractors, not only would they be able to repair them, but they’d also be able to customize the vehicles for their needs. Life-changing technology should be available to all, he thought, not controlled by a select few. So, with an understanding of mechanical engineering, Jakubowski built his own tractor and put all his schematics online on his platform Open Source Ecology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That tractor Jakubowski built is designed to be taken apart. It’s a critical part of the GVCS, a collection of plug-and-play machines that can “build a thriving economy anywhere in the world … from scratch.” The GVCS includes a 3D printer, a self-contained hydraulic power unit called the Power Cube, and more, each designed to be reconfigured for multiple purposes. There’s even a GVCS micro-home. You can use the Power Cube to power a brick press, a sawmill, a car, a CNC mill, or a bioplastic extruder, and you can build wind turbines with the frames that are used in the home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski compares the GVCS to Lego blocks and cites the Linux ecosystem as his inspiration. In the same way that Linux’s source code is free to inspect, modify, and redistribute, all the instructions you need to build and repurpose a GVCS machine are freely accessible online. Jakubowski envisions a future in which the GVCS parallels the Linux infrastructure, with custom tools built to optimize agriculture, construction, and material fabrication in localized contexts. “The [final form of the GVCS] must be proven to allow efficient production of food, shelter, consumer goods, cars, fuel, and other goods—except for exotic imports (coffee, bananas, advanced semiconductors),” he wrote on his Open Source Ecology wiki.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ethos of GVCS is reminiscent of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a countercultural publication that offered a combination of reviews, DIY manuals, and survival guides between 1968 and 1972. Founded by Stewart Brand, the publication had the slogan “Access to tools” and was famous for promoting self-sufficiency. It heavily featured the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term “ephemeralization,” which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="plans for a lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125481" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LifeTrac.jpg?w=995" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The schematics for Marcin Jakubowski's designs are all available online.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski owns the publication’s entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. “The first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet—Fuller patented his stuff,” he says. Fuller and the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/em&gt; may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. “The failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125482" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lifetrac2.webp?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With a background in physics and an understanding of mechanical engineering, Marcin Jakubowski built his own tractor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike software, hardware can’t be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints—different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology “appropriate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Appropriate technology is technology that’s designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi’s philosophy of &lt;em&gt;swadeshi&lt;/em&gt; (self-reliance) and &lt;em&gt;sarvodaya&lt;/em&gt; (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich “Fritz” Schumacher’s book &lt;em&gt;Small Is Beautiful,&lt;/em&gt; which discussed the concept of “intermediate technology”: “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.” Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-­powered water pumps—anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community—are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;What makes Jakubowski’s technology “appropriate” is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he’s able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everything you need to build Jakubowski’s machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online—from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. “If you’ve got a wrench, you’ve got a tractor,” his manual reads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spirit dates back to the ’70s, when the idea of building things “moved out of the retired person’s garage and into the young person’s relationship with the Volkswagen,” says Brand. He references John Muir’s 1969 book &lt;em&gt;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&lt;/em&gt; and fondly recalls how the Beetle’s simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were “appropriate” in Jakubowski’s terms, Brand says: “A century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.” The company “attracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,” Brand says, but “they’ve really reversed the orientation.” Echoing Jakubowski’s initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe’s, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the many machines developed, what’s drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed “The Liberator,” which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs—a type of cost- and energy-­efficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It’s been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aurélien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125480" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chrow.jpg?w=2554" width="2554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CEB press, nicknamed “The Liberator,” turns local soil into energy-efficient compressed earth blocks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: “When [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.” Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. “I had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,” he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. “Pretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees. Spina spent five years building versions of the GVCS tractor and Power Cube, eager to create means of self-­sufficiency at an individual scale. “I’m building my own tractor because I want to understand it and be able to maintain it,” he wrote in his blog, &lt;em&gt;Machining Independence.&lt;/em&gt; Spina’s curiosity gestures toward the broader issue of technological literacy: The more we outsource to proprietary tech, the less we understand how things work—further entrenching our need for that proprietary tech. Transparency is critical to the open-source philosophy precisely because it helps us become self-sufficient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since starting Open Source Ecology, Jakubowski has been the main architect behind the dozens of machines available on his platform, testing and refining his designs on a plot of land he calls the Factor&amp;nbsp;e Farm in Maysville. Most GVCS enthusiasts reproduce Jakubowski’s machines for personal use; only a few have contributed to the set themselves. Of those select few, many made dedicated visits to the farm for weeks at a time to learn how to build Jakubowski’s GVCS collection. James Wise, one of the earliest and longest-term GVCS contributors, recalls setting up tents and camping out in his car to attend sessions at Jakubowski’s workshop, where visiting enthusiasts would gather to iterate on designs: “We’d have a screen on the wall of our current best idea. Then we’d talk about it.” Wise doesn’t consider himself particularly experienced on the engineering front, but after working with other visiting participants, he felt more emboldened to contribute. “Most of [my] knowledge came from [my] peers,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski’s goal of bolstering collaboration hinges on a degree of collective proficiency. Without a community skilled with hardware, the organic innovation that the open-source approach promises will struggle to bear fruit, even if Jakubowski’s designs are perfectly appropriate and thoroughly documented.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“That’s why we’re starting a school!” said Jakubowski, when asked about his plan to build hardware literacy. Earlier this year, he announced the Future Builders Academy, an apprenticeship program where participants will be taught all the necessary skills to develop and build the affordable, self-sustaining homes that are his newest venture. Seed Eco Homes, as Jakubowski calls them, are “human-sized, panelized” modular houses complete with a biodigester, a thermal battery, a geothermal cooling system, and solar electricity. Each house is entirely energy independent and can be built in five days, at a cost of around $40,000. Over eight of these houses have been built across the country, and Jakubowski himself lives in the earliest version of the design. Seed Eco Homes are the culmination of his work on the GVCS: The structure of each house combines parts from the collection and embodies its modular philosophy. The venture represents Jakubowski’s larger goal of making everyday technology accessible. “Housing [is the] single largest cost in one’s life—and a key to so much more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The final goal of Open Source Ecology is a “zero marginal cost” society, where producing an additional unit of a good or service costs little to nothing. Jakubowski’s interpretation of the concept (popularized by the American economist and social theorist Jeremy Rifkin) assumes that by eradicating licensing fees, decentralizing manufacturing, and fostering collaboration through education, we can develop truly equitable technology that allows us to be self-sufficient. Open-source hardware isn’t just about helping farmers build their own tractors; in Jakubowski’s view, it’s a complete reorientation of our relationship to technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first issue of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a key piece of inspiration for Jakubowski’s project, Brand wrote: “We are as gods and we might as well get good at it.” In 2007, in a book Brand wrote about the publication, he corrected himself: “We are as gods and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get good at it.” Today, Jakubowski elaborates: “We’re becoming gods with technology. Yet technology has badly failed us. We’ve seen great progress with civilization. But how free are people today compared to other times?” Cautioning against our reliance on the proprietary technology we use daily, he offers a new approach: Progress should mean not just achieving technological breakthroughs but also making everyday technology equitable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t need more technology,” he says. “We just need to collaborate with what we have now.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiffany Ng is a freelance writer exploring the relationship between art, tech, and culture.

You rely on the sun for power, heat your home with a woodstove, and farm your own fish and vegetables. The year is 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the life of Marcin Jakubowski, the 53-year-old founder of Open Source Ecology, an open collaborative of engineers, producers, and builders developing what they call the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). It’s a set of 50 machines—everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker—that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the “prosperity of technology” was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a bachelor’s degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school. While his peers kick-started their shiny new corporate careers, he followed a different path after he finished his degree in 2003: He bought a tractor to start a farm in Maysville, Missouri, eager to prove his ideas about abundance. “It was a clear decision to give up the office cubicle or high-level research job, which is so focused on tiny issues that one never gets to work on the big picture,” he says. But in just a short few months, his tractor broke down—and he soon went broke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Every time his tractor malfunctioned, he had no choice but to pay John Deere for repairs—even if he knew how to fix the problem on his own. John Deere, the world’s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, continues to prohibit farmers from repairing their own tractors (except in Colorado, where farmers were granted a right to repair by state law in 2023). Fixing your own tractor voids any insurance or warranty, much like jailbreaking your iPhone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, large agricultural manufacturers have centralized control over the market, and most commercial tractors are built with proprietary parts. Every year, farmers pay $1.2 billion in repair costs and lose an estimated $3 billion whenever their tractors break down, entirely because large agricultural manufacturers have lobbied against the right to repair since the ’90s. Currently there are class action lawsuits involving hundreds of farmers fighting for their right to do so.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The machines own farmers. The farmers don’t own [the machines],” Jakubowski says. He grew certain that self-sufficiency relied on agricultural autonomy, which could be achieved only through free access to technology. So he set out to apply the principles of open-source software to hardware. He figured that if farmers could have access to the instructions and materials required to build their own tractors, not only would they be able to repair them, but they’d also be able to customize the vehicles for their needs. Life-changing technology should be available to all, he thought, not controlled by a select few. So, with an understanding of mechanical engineering, Jakubowski built his own tractor and put all his schematics online on his platform Open Source Ecology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That tractor Jakubowski built is designed to be taken apart. It’s a critical part of the GVCS, a collection of plug-and-play machines that can “build a thriving economy anywhere in the world … from scratch.” The GVCS includes a 3D printer, a self-contained hydraulic power unit called the Power Cube, and more, each designed to be reconfigured for multiple purposes. There’s even a GVCS micro-home. You can use the Power Cube to power a brick press, a sawmill, a car, a CNC mill, or a bioplastic extruder, and you can build wind turbines with the frames that are used in the home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski compares the GVCS to Lego blocks and cites the Linux ecosystem as his inspiration. In the same way that Linux’s source code is free to inspect, modify, and redistribute, all the instructions you need to build and repurpose a GVCS machine are freely accessible online. Jakubowski envisions a future in which the GVCS parallels the Linux infrastructure, with custom tools built to optimize agriculture, construction, and material fabrication in localized contexts. “The [final form of the GVCS] must be proven to allow efficient production of food, shelter, consumer goods, cars, fuel, and other goods—except for exotic imports (coffee, bananas, advanced semiconductors),” he wrote on his Open Source Ecology wiki.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ethos of GVCS is reminiscent of the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog,&lt;/em&gt; a countercultural publication that offered a combination of reviews, DIY manuals, and survival guides between 1968 and 1972. Founded by Stewart Brand, the publication had the slogan “Access to tools” and was famous for promoting self-sufficiency. It heavily featured the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, an American architect known for his geodesic domes (lightweight structures that can be built using recycled materials) and for coining the term “ephemeralization,” which refers to the ability of technology to let us do more with less material, energy, and effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="plans for a lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125481" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LifeTrac.jpg?w=995" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The schematics for Marcin Jakubowski's designs are all available online.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski owns the publication’s entire printed output, but he offers a sharp critique of its legacy in our current culture of tech utopianism. “The first structures we built were domes. Good ideas. But the open-source part of that was not really there yet—Fuller patented his stuff,” he says. Fuller and the &lt;em&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/em&gt; may have popularized an important philosophy of self-reliance, but to Jakubowski, their failure to advocate for open collaboration stopped the ultimate vision of sustainability from coming to fruition. “The failure of the techno-utopians to organize into a larger movement of collaborative, open, distributed production resulted in a miscarriage of techno-utopia,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="lifetrac tractor" class="wp-image-1125482" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lifetrac2.webp?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With a background in physics and an understanding of mechanical engineering, Marcin Jakubowski built his own tractor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike software, hardware can’t be infinitely reproduced or instantly tested. It requires manufacturing infrastructure and specific materials, not to mention exhaustive documentation. There are physical constraints—different port standards, fluctuations in availability of materials, and more. And now that production chains are so globalized that manufacturing a hot tub can require parts from seven different countries and 14 states, how can we expect anything to be replicable in our backyard? The solution, according to Jakubowski, is to make technology “appropriate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Appropriate technology is technology that’s designed to be affordable and sustainable for a specific local context. The idea comes from Gandhi’s philosophy of &lt;em&gt;swadeshi&lt;/em&gt; (self-reliance) and &lt;em&gt;sarvodaya&lt;/em&gt; (upliftment of all) and was popularized by the economist Ernst Friedrich “Fritz” Schumacher’s book &lt;em&gt;Small Is Beautiful,&lt;/em&gt; which discussed the concept of “intermediate technology”: “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction.” Because different environments operate at different scales and with different resources, it only makes sense to tailor technology for those conditions. Solar lamps, bikes, hand-­powered water pumps—anything that can be built using local materials and maintained by the local community—are among the most widely cited examples of appropriate technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This concept has historically been discussed in the context of facilitating economic growth in developing nations and adapting capital-intensive technology to their needs. But Jakubowski hopes to make it universal. He believes technology needs to be appropriate even in suburban and urban places with access to supermarkets, hardware stores, Amazon deliveries, and other forms of infrastructure. If technology is designed specifically for these contexts, he says, end-to-end reproduction will be possible, making more space for collaboration and innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;What makes Jakubowski’s technology “appropriate” is his use of reclaimed materials and off-the-shelf parts to build his machines. By using local materials and widely available components, he’s able to bypass the complex global supply chains that proprietary technology often requires. He also structures his schematics around concepts already familiar to most people who are interested in hardware, making his building instructions easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everything you need to build Jakubowski’s machines should be available around you, just as everything you need to know about how to repair or operate the machine is online—from blueprints to lists of materials to assembly instructions and testing protocols. “If you’ve got a wrench, you’ve got a tractor,” his manual reads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This spirit dates back to the ’70s, when the idea of building things “moved out of the retired person’s garage and into the young person’s relationship with the Volkswagen,” says Brand. He references John Muir’s 1969 book &lt;em&gt;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&lt;/em&gt; and fondly recalls how the Beetle’s simple design and easily swapped parts made it common for owners to rebody their cars, combining the chassis of one with the body of another. He also mentions the impact of the Ford Model T cars that, with a few extra parts, were made into tractors during the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Brand, the focus on repairability is critical in the modern context. There was a time when John Deere tractors were “appropriate” in Jakubowski’s terms, Brand says: “A century earlier, John Deere took great care to make sure that his plowshares could be taken apart and bolted together, that you can undo and redo them, replace parts, and so on.” The company “attracted insanely loyal customers because they looked out for the farmers so much,” Brand says, but “they’ve really reversed the orientation.” Echoing Jakubowski’s initial motivation for starting OSE, Brand insists that technology is appropriate to the extent that it is repairable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you can find all the parts you need from Lowe’s, building your own tractor is still intimidating. But for some, the staggering price advantage is reason enough to take on the challenge: A GVCS tractor costs $12,000 to build, whereas a commercial tractor averages around $120,000 to buy, not including the individual repairs that might be necessary over its lifetime at a cost of $500 to $20,000 each. And gargantuan though it may seem, the task of building a GVCS tractor or other machine is doable: Just a few years after the project launched in 2008, more than 110 machines had been built by enthusiasts from Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, China, India, Italy, and Turkey, just to name a few places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the many machines developed, what’s drawn the most interest from GVCS enthusiasts is the one nicknamed “The Liberator,” which presses local soil into compressed earth blocks, or CEBs—a type of cost- and energy-­efficient brick that can withstand extreme weather conditions. It’s been especially popular among those looking to build their own homes: A man named Aurélien Bielsa replicated the brick press in a small village in the south of France to build a house for his family in 2018, and in 2020 a group of volunteers helped a member of the Open Source Ecology community build a tiny home using blocks from one of these presses in a fishing village near northern Belize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125480" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chrow.jpg?w=2554" width="2554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CEB press, nicknamed “The Liberator,” turns local soil into energy-efficient compressed earth blocks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF OPEN SOURCE ECOLOGY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jakubowski recalls receiving an email about one of the first complete reproductions of the CEB press, built by a Texan named James Slate, who ended up starting a business selling the bricks: “When [James] sent me a picture [of our brick press], I thought it was a Photoshopped copy of our machine, but it was his. He just downloaded the plans off the internet. I knew nothing about it.” Slate described having a very limited background in engineering before building the brick press. “I had taken some mechanics classes back in high school. I mostly come from an IT computer world,” he said in an interview with Open Source Ecology. “Pretty much anyone can build one, if they put in the effort.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Spina, an early GVCS enthusiast, agrees.

That wait period is often filled with worry and it always feels like an eternity. But what if that wait could be cut from weeks down to just a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of its ‘AI Airlock’ programme, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is evaluating seven new technologies designed to tackle some of healthcare’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovations being trialled could slash the time for bowel cancer test results to mere minutes and enable earlier detection of skin cancer and genetic eye diseases. The AI Airlock initiative provides a secure, controlled environment for manufacturers to test these sophisticated systems.

This commission brings together a diverse group of patient advocates, clinicians, regulators, and technology companies to advise the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven selected technologies include AI-powered clinical note-taking to reduce administrative burdens on doctors, advanced cancer diagnostics, sophisticated eye disease detection, and tools that can summarise a patient’s entire hospital stay or interpret complex blood tests.

That wait period is often filled with worry and it always feels like an eternity. But what if that wait could be cut from weeks down to just a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of its ‘AI Airlock’ programme, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is evaluating seven new technologies designed to tackle some of healthcare’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovations being trialled could slash the time for bowel cancer test results to mere minutes and enable earlier detection of skin cancer and genetic eye diseases.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a consequential act of quiet regulation. Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has updated millions of websites' robots.txt files in an effort to force Google to change how it crawls them to fuel its AI products and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince about what exactly is going on here, why it matters, and what the web might soon look like. But to get into that, we need to cover a little background first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new change, which Cloudflare calls its Content Signals Policy, happened after publishers and other companies that depend on web traffic have cried foul over Google's AI Overviews and similar AI answer engines, saying they are sharply cutting those companies' path to revenue because they don't send traffic back to the source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lawsuits, efforts to kick-start new marketplaces to ensure compensation, and more—but few companies have the kind of leverage Cloudflare does. Its products and services back something close to 20 percent of the web, and thus a significant slice of the websites that show up on search results pages or that fuel large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost every reasonable AI company that's out there is saying, listen, if it's a fair playing field, then we're happy to pay for content," Prince said. "The problem is that all of them are terrified of Google because if Google gets content for free but they all have to pay for it, they are always going to be at an inherent disadvantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening because Google is using its dominant position in search to ensure that web publishers allow their content to be used in ways that they might not otherwise want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The changing norms of the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, Google has offered a way for website administrators to opt their content out of use for training Google's large language models, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, allowing pages to be indexed by Google's search crawlers and shown in results requires accepting that they'll also be used to generate AI Overviews at the top of results pages through a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That's not so for many other crawlers, making Google an outlier among major players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sore point for a wide range of website administrators, from news websites that publish journalism to investment banks that produce research reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July study from the Pew Research Center analyzed data from 900 adults in the US and found that AI Overviews cut referrals nearly in half. Specifically, users clicked a link on a page with AI Overviews at the top just 8 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for search engine results pages without those summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a report in The Wall Street Journal cited a wide range of sources—including internal traffic metrics from numerous major publications like The New York Times and Business Insider—to describe industry-wide plummets in website traffic that those publishers said were tied to AI summaries, leading to layoffs and strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, disputed the validity and applicability of studies and publisher reports of reduced link clicks in search. "Overall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year," she wrote, going on to say that reports of big declines were "often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in Search."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers aren't convinced. Penske Media Corporation, which owns brands like The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone, sued Google over AI Overviews in September. The suit claims that affiliate link revenue has dropped by more than a third in the past year, due in large part to Google's overviews—a threatening shortfall in a business that already has difficult margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penske's suit specifically noted that because Google bundles traditional search engine indexing and RAG use together, the company has no choice but to allow Google to keep summarizing its articles, as cutting off Google search referrals entirely would be financially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of digital publishing, referrals have in one way or another acted as the backbone of the web's economy. Content could be made available freely to both human readers and crawlers, and norms were applied across the web to allow information to be tracked back to its source and give that source an opportunity to monetize its content to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Today, there's a panic that the old system isn't working anymore as content summaries via RAG have become more common, and along with other players, Cloudflare is trying to update those norms to reflect the current reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mass-scale update to robots.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced on September 24, Cloudflare's Content Signals Policy is an effort to use the company's influential market position to change how content is used by web crawlers. It involves updating millions of websites' robots.txt files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1994, websites began placing a file called "robots.txt" at the domain root to indicate to automated web crawlers which parts of the domain should be crawled and indexed and which should be ignored. The standard became near-universal over the years; honoring it has been a key part of how Google's web crawlers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, robots.txt simply includes a list of paths on the domain that were flagged as either "allow" or "disallow." It was technically not enforceable, but it became an effective honor system because there are advantages to it for the owners of both the website and the crawler: Website owners could dictate access for various business reasons, and it helped crawlers avoid working through data that wouldn't be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But robots.txt only tells crawlers whether they can access something at all; it doesn't tell them what they can use it for. For example, Google supports disallowing the agent "Google-Extended" as a path to blocking crawlers that are looking for content with which to train future versions of its Gemini large language model—though introducing that rule doesn't do anything about the training Google did before it rolled out Google-Extended in 2023, and it doesn't stop crawling for RAG and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content Signals Policy initiative is a newly proposed format for robots.txt that intends to do that. It allows website operators to opt in or out of consenting to the following use cases, as worded in the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ai-input: Inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of content for generative AI search answers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ai-train: Training or fine-tuning AI models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has given all of its customers quick paths for setting those values on a case-by-case basis. Further, it has automatically updated robots.txt on the 3.8 million domains that already use Cloudflare's managed robots.txt feature, with search defaulting to yes, ai-train to no, and ai-input blank, indicating a neutral position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The threat of potential litigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making this look a bit like a terms of service agreement, Cloudflare's goal is explicitly to put legal pressure on Google to change its policy of bundling traditional search crawlers and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make no mistake, the legal team at Google is looking at this saying, 'Huh, that's now something that we have to actively choose to ignore across a significant portion of the web,'" Prince told me.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further characterized this as an effort to get a company that he says has historically been "largely a good actor" and a "patron of the web" to go back to doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inside of Google, there is a fight where there are people who are saying we should change how we're doing this," he explained. "And there are other people saying, no, that gives up our inherent advantage, we have a God-given right to all the content on the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid that debate, lawyers have sway at Google, so Cloudflare tried to design tools "that made it very clear that if they were going to follow any of these sites, there was a clear license which was in place for them. And that will create risk for them if they don't follow it," Prince said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The next web paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a company with Cloudflare's scale to do something like this with any hope that it will have an impact. If just a few websites made this change, Google would have an easier time ignoring it, or worse yet, it could simply stop crawling them to avoid the problem. Since Cloudflare is entangled with millions of websites, Google couldn't do that without materially impacting the quality of the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a vested interest in the general health of the web, but there are other strategic considerations at play, too. The company has been working on tools to assist with RAG on customers' websites in partnership with Microsoft-owned Google competitor Bing and has experimented with a marketplace that provides a way for websites to charge crawlers for scraping the sites for AI, though what final form that might take is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Prince directly if this comes from a place of conviction. "There are very few times that opportunities come along where you get to help think through what a future better business model of an organization or institution as large as the Internet and as important as the Internet is," he said. "As we do that, I think that we should all be thinking about what have we learned that was good about the Internet in the past and what have we learned that was bad about the Internet in the past."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that we don't yet know what the future business model of the web will look like. Cloudflare itself has ideas. Others have proposed new standards, marketplaces, and strategies, too. There will be winners and losers, and those won't always be the same winners and losers we saw in the previous paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people seem to agree on, whatever their individual incentives, is that Google shouldn't get to come out on top in a future answer-engine-driven web paradigm just because it previously established dominance in the search-engine-driven one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this new standard for robots.txt, success looks like Google allowing content to be available in search but not in AI Overviews. Whatever the long-term vision, and whether it happens because of Cloudflare's pressure with the Content Signals Policy or some other driving force, most agree that it would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a consequential act of quiet regulation. Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has updated millions of websites' robots.txt files in an effort to force Google to change how it crawls them to fuel its AI products and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince about what exactly is going on here, why it matters, and what the web might soon look like. But to get into that, we need to cover a little background first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new change, which Cloudflare calls its Content Signals Policy, happened after publishers and other companies that depend on web traffic have cried foul over Google's AI Overviews and similar AI answer engines, saying they are sharply cutting those companies' path to revenue because they don't send traffic back to the source of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lawsuits, efforts to kick-start new marketplaces to ensure compensation, and more—but few companies have the kind of leverage Cloudflare does. Its products and services back something close to 20 percent of the web, and thus a significant slice of the websites that show up on search results pages or that fuel large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost every reasonable AI company that's out there is saying, listen, if it's a fair playing field, then we're happy to pay for content," Prince said. "The problem is that all of them are terrified of Google because if Google gets content for free but they all have to pay for it, they are always going to be at an inherent disadvantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening because Google is using its dominant position in search to ensure that web publishers allow their content to be used in ways that they might not otherwise want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The changing norms of the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2023, Google has offered a way for website administrators to opt their content out of use for training Google's large language models, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, allowing pages to be indexed by Google's search crawlers and shown in results requires accepting that they'll also be used to generate AI Overviews at the top of results pages through a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That's not so for many other crawlers, making Google an outlier among major players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sore point for a wide range of website administrators, from news websites that publish journalism to investment banks that produce research reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July study from the Pew Research Center analyzed data from 900 adults in the US and found that AI Overviews cut referrals nearly in half. Specifically, users clicked a link on a page with AI Overviews at the top just 8 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for search engine results pages without those summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a report in The Wall Street Journal cited a wide range of sources—including internal traffic metrics from numerous major publications like The New York Times and Business Insider—to describe industry-wide plummets in website traffic that those publishers said were tied to AI summaries, leading to layoffs and strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, disputed the validity and applicability of studies and publisher reports of reduced link clicks in search. "Overall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year," she wrote, going on to say that reports of big declines were "often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in Search."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers aren't convinced. Penske Media Corporation, which owns brands like The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone, sued Google over AI Overviews in September. The suit claims that affiliate link revenue has dropped by more than a third in the past year, due in large part to Google's overviews—a threatening shortfall in a business that already has difficult margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penske's suit specifically noted that because Google bundles traditional search engine indexing and RAG use together, the company has no choice but to allow Google to keep summarizing its articles, as cutting off Google search referrals entirely would be financially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest days of digital publishing, referrals have in one way or another acted as the backbone of the web's economy. Content could be made available freely to both human readers and crawlers, and norms were applied across the web to allow information to be tracked back to its source and give that source an opportunity to monetize its content to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Today, there's a panic that the old system isn't working anymore as content summaries via RAG have become more common, and along with other players, Cloudflare is trying to update those norms to reflect the current reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mass-scale update to robots.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced on September 24, Cloudflare's Content Signals Policy is an effort to use the company's influential market position to change how content is used by web crawlers. It involves updating millions of websites' robots.txt files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1994, websites began placing a file called "robots.txt" at the domain root to indicate to automated web crawlers which parts of the domain should be crawled and indexed and which should be ignored. The standard became near-universal over the years; honoring it has been a key part of how Google's web crawlers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, robots.txt simply includes a list of paths on the domain that were flagged as either "allow" or "disallow." It was technically not enforceable, but it became an effective honor system because there are advantages to it for the owners of both the website and the crawler: Website owners could dictate access for various business reasons, and it helped crawlers avoid working through data that wouldn't be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But robots.txt only tells crawlers whether they can access something at all; it doesn't tell them what they can use it for. For example, Google supports disallowing the agent "Google-Extended" as a path to blocking crawlers that are looking for content with which to train future versions of its Gemini large language model—though introducing that rule doesn't do anything about the training Google did before it rolled out Google-Extended in 2023, and it doesn't stop crawling for RAG and AI Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content Signals Policy initiative is a newly proposed format for robots.txt that intends to do that. It allows website operators to opt in or out of consenting to the following use cases, as worded in the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

      Cloudflare specifically made this look like a license agreement.

&lt;p&gt;He further characterized this as an effort to get a company that he says has historically been "largely a good actor" and a "patron of the web" to go back to doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inside of Google, there is a fight where there are people who are saying we should change how we're doing this," he explained. "And there are other people saying, no, that gives up our inherent advantage, we have a God-given right to all the content on the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid that debate, lawyers have sway at Google, so Cloudflare tried to design tools "that made it very clear that if they were going to follow any of these sites, there was a clear license which was in place for them. And that will create risk for them if they don't follow it," Prince said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The next web paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a company with Cloudflare's scale to do something like this with any hope that it will have an impact. If just a few websites made this change, Google would have an easier time ignoring it, or worse yet, it could simply stop crawling them to avoid the problem. Since Cloudflare is entangled with millions of websites, Google couldn't do that without materially impacting the quality of the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a vested interest in the general health of the web, but there are other strategic considerations at play, too. The company has been working on tools to assist with RAG on customers' websites in partnership with Microsoft-owned Google competitor Bing and has experimented with a marketplace that provides a way for websites to charge crawlers for scraping the sites for AI, though what final form that might take is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Prince directly if this comes from a place of conviction. "There are very few times that opportunities come along where you get to help think through what a future better business model of an organization or institution as large as the Internet and as important as the Internet is," he said. "As we do that, I think that we should all be thinking about what have we learned that was good about the Internet in the past and what have we learned that was bad about the Internet in the past."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that we don't yet know what the future business model of the web will look like. Cloudflare itself has ideas. Others have proposed new standards, marketplaces, and strategies, too. There will be winners and losers, and those won't always be the same winners and losers we saw in the previous paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people seem to agree on, whatever their individual incentives, is that Google shouldn't get to come out on top in a future answer-engine-driven web paradigm just because it previously established dominance in the search-engine-driven one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this new standard for robots.txt, success looks like Google allowing content to be available in search but not in AI Overviews. Whatever the long-term vision, and whether it happens because of Cloudflare's pressure with the Content Signals Policy or some other driving force, most agree that it would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

Listings are posted and re-posted across different platforms as applications go unanswered, creating a spam-like flood of activity on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you put a job on LinkedIn, you might get 1,000 people applying for that job within the first six hours,” says Matt Wilson, a London-based serial entrepreneur. “Some companies don’t even review the applicants that apply for those jobs, because the signal to noise ratio is very, very low.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wilson’s new solution is Jack &amp;amp; Jill, a new platform that uses conversational AI to reinvent the recruitment process from the ground up. The company announced $20 million in seed funding today, led by EU investor Creandum, but it’s hardly been in stealth. Service is already live in London, where the outfit has garnered nearly 50,000 users — and Wilson wants to use the influx of cash to fuel a US expansion and take Jack &amp;amp; Jill to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There hasn’t been a major change in how people find jobs since LinkedIn and Indeed came on the scene 20 years ago,” says Wilson. His bet is that, with AI chatbots changing workplaces across the world, now might be the time to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As you might guess from the name, Jack &amp;amp; Jill is a two-part platform. The “Jack” side of the platform handles the applicant side, giving users a 20-minute, AI-powered profile interview before providing them with a select list of roles pulled from online databases. From there, Jack can be used for mock interviews or more involved professional coaching. “Jill” works with employers, building a profile of a particular role and elevating candidates that match its requirements. Like LinkedIn, part of the goal is for both workers and hiring managers to keep an active presence on their respective apps, letting the app pull players off the sidelines as needed. The service takes a standard commission from any successful hire, and as the scope of the platform grows, Wilson hopes to make Jack &amp;amp; Jill indispensable for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That might sound like a standard recruiting system with a little AI sprinkled on top, but Wilson thinks conversational chatbots are more important than a simple matching algorithm. By building the process around chatbot interviews, he believes he’s found a scalable alternative to the endless shuffle of listings and resumes, potentially reinventing the basic elements of the contemporary hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI systems to conduct first-round interviews is increasingly common in many parts of the world — particularly in China, where many multinational corporations have used the practice for hiring local roles. But while a surprise interview with an AI hiring manager might seem alienating, Wilson hopes that Jack &amp;amp; Jill’s approach will result in more intelligence applied to job placement overall.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="uni-paragraph article-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of our research collaboration with Yale University, we’re releasing Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (C2S-Scale), a new 27 billion parameter foundation model designed to understand the language of individual cells. Built on the Gemma family of open models, C2S-Scale represents a new frontier in single-cell analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement marks a milestone for AI in science. C2S-Scale generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior and we have since confirmed its prediction with experimental validation in living cells. This discovery reveals a promising new pathway for developing therapies to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This launch builds upon our work from earlier this year, where we demonstrated that biological models follow clear scaling laws — just like with natural language, larger models perform better on biology. This work raised a critical question: Does a larger model just get better at existing tasks, or can it acquire entirely new capabilities? The true promise of scaling lies in the creation of new ideas, and the discovery of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How C2S-Scale 27B works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is that many tumors are “cold” — invisible to the body's immune system. A key strategy to make them “hot” is to force them to display immune-triggering signals through a process called antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  

  
    















  
  
    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  



  

  
    &lt;div class="module--text module--text__article"&gt;
      &lt;div class="uni-paragraph article-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gave our new C2S-Scale 27B model a task: Find a drug that acts as a &lt;i&gt;conditional amplifier&lt;/i&gt;, one that would boost the immune signal &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; in a specific “immune-context-positive” environment where low levels of interferon (a key immune-signaling protein) were already present, but inadequate to induce antigen presentation on their own. This required a level of conditional reasoning that appeared to be an emergent capability of scale; our smaller models could not resolve this context-dependent effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish that, we designed a &lt;i&gt;dual-context virtual screen&lt;/i&gt; to find this specific synergistic effect. The virtual screen involved two stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immune-Context-Positive:&lt;/b&gt; We provided the model with real-world patient samples with intact tumor-immune interactions and low-level interferon signaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immune-Context-Neutral:&lt;/b&gt; We provided the model with isolated cell line data with no immune context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs across both contexts and asked the model to predict which drugs would &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; boost antigen presentation in the first context, to bias the screen towards the patient-relevant setting. Out of the many drug candidates highlighted by the model, a fraction (10-30%) of drug hits are already known in prior literature, while the remaining drugs are &lt;i&gt;surprising hits&lt;/i&gt; with no prior known link to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From prediction to experimental validation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model's predictions were clear. It identified a striking “context split” for the kinase CK2 inhibitor called silmitasertib (CX-4945). The model predicted a strong &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in antigen presentation when silmitasertib was applied in the “immune-context-positive” setting, but little to no effect in the “immune-context-neutral” one. What made this prediction so exciting was that it was a novel idea. Although CK2 has been implicated in many cellular functions, including as a modulator of the immune system, inhibiting CK2 via silmitasertib has not been reported in the literature to explicitly enhance MHC-I expression or antigen presentation. This highlights that the model was generating a new, testable hypothesis, and not just repeating known facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prediction, however, is only valuable if it can be validated in clinical application. The real test is first in the lab, and eventually, in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next phase of our project, we took this hypothesis to the lab bench and tested it in human neuroendocrine cell models — a cell type that was completely unseen by the model during training. The experiments demonstrated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with silmitasertib alone had no effect on antigen presentation (MHC-I).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with a low dose of interferon alone had a modest effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with both silmitasertib and low-dose interferon produced a marked, synergistic amplification of antigen presentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, in our lab tests the combination of silmitasertib and low-dose interferon resulted in a roughly 50% increase in antigen presentation, which would make the tumor more visible to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; prediction was confirmed multiple times &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. C2S-Scale had successfully identified a novel, interferon-conditional amplifier, revealing a new potential pathway to make “cold” tumors “hot,” and potentially more responsive to immunotherapy. While this is an early first step, it provides a powerful, experimentally-validated lead for developing new combination therapies, which use multiple drugs in concert to achieve a more robust effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result also provides a blueprint for a new kind of biological discovery. It demonstrates that by following the scaling laws and building larger models like C2S-Scale 27B, we can create predictive models of cellular behavior that are powerful enough to run high-throughput virtual screens, discover context-conditioned biology, and generate biologically-grounded hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams at Yale are now exploring the mechanism uncovered here and testing additional AI-generated predictions in other immune contexts. With further preclinical and clinical validation, such hypotheses may be able to ultimately accelerate the path to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with C2S-Scale 27B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new C2S-Scale 27B model and its resources are available today for the research community.

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of our research collaboration with Yale University, we’re releasing Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (C2S-Scale), a new 27 billion parameter foundation model designed to understand the language of individual cells. Built on the Gemma family of open models, C2S-Scale represents a new frontier in single-cell analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement marks a milestone for AI in science. C2S-Scale generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior and we have since confirmed its prediction with experimental validation in living cells. This discovery reveals a promising new pathway for developing therapies to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This launch builds upon our work from earlier this year, where we demonstrated that biological models follow clear scaling laws — just like with natural language, larger models perform better on biology. This work raised a critical question: Does a larger model just get better at existing tasks, or can it acquire entirely new capabilities? The true promise of scaling lies in the creation of new ideas, and the discovery of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How C2S-Scale 27B works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is that many tumors are “cold” — invisible to the body's immune system. A key strategy to make them “hot” is to force them to display immune-triggering signals through a process called antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="module--text module--text__article"&gt;
      &lt;div class="uni-paragraph article-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gave our new C2S-Scale 27B model a task: Find a drug that acts as a &lt;i&gt;conditional amplifier&lt;/i&gt;, one that would boost the immune signal &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; in a specific “immune-context-positive” environment where low levels of interferon (a key immune-signaling protein) were already present, but inadequate to induce antigen presentation on their own. This required a level of conditional reasoning that appeared to be an emergent capability of scale; our smaller models could not resolve this context-dependent effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish that, we designed a &lt;i&gt;dual-context virtual screen&lt;/i&gt; to find this specific synergistic effect. The virtual screen involved two stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immune-Context-Positive:&lt;/b&gt; We provided the model with real-world patient samples with intact tumor-immune interactions and low-level interferon signaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immune-Context-Neutral:&lt;/b&gt; We provided the model with isolated cell line data with no immune context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs across both contexts and asked the model to predict which drugs would &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; boost antigen presentation in the first context, to bias the screen towards the patient-relevant setting. Out of the many drug candidates highlighted by the model, a fraction (10-30%) of drug hits are already known in prior literature, while the remaining drugs are &lt;i&gt;surprising hits&lt;/i&gt; with no prior known link to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From prediction to experimental validation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model's predictions were clear. It identified a striking “context split” for the kinase CK2 inhibitor called silmitasertib (CX-4945). The model predicted a strong &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in antigen presentation when silmitasertib was applied in the “immune-context-positive” setting, but little to no effect in the “immune-context-neutral” one. What made this prediction so exciting was that it was a novel idea. Although CK2 has been implicated in many cellular functions, including as a modulator of the immune system, inhibiting CK2 via silmitasertib has not been reported in the literature to explicitly enhance MHC-I expression or antigen presentation. This highlights that the model was generating a new, testable hypothesis, and not just repeating known facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prediction, however, is only valuable if it can be validated in clinical application. The real test is first in the lab, and eventually, in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next phase of our project, we took this hypothesis to the lab bench and tested it in human neuroendocrine cell models — a cell type that was completely unseen by the model during training. The experiments demonstrated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with silmitasertib alone had no effect on antigen presentation (MHC-I).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with a low dose of interferon alone had a modest effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treating the cells with both silmitasertib and low-dose interferon produced a marked, synergistic amplification of antigen presentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, in our lab tests the combination of silmitasertib and low-dose interferon resulted in a roughly 50% increase in antigen presentation, which would make the tumor more visible to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; prediction was confirmed multiple times &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. C2S-Scale had successfully identified a novel, interferon-conditional amplifier, revealing a new potential pathway to make “cold” tumors “hot,” and potentially more responsive to immunotherapy. While this is an early first step, it provides a powerful, experimentally-validated lead for developing new combination therapies, which use multiple drugs in concert to achieve a more robust effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result also provides a blueprint for a new kind of biological discovery. It demonstrates that by following the scaling laws and building larger models like C2S-Scale 27B, we can create predictive models of cellular behavior that are powerful enough to run high-throughput virtual screens, discover context-conditioned biology, and generate biologically-grounded hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams at Yale are now exploring the mechanism uncovered here and testing additional AI-generated predictions in other immune contexts. With further preclinical and clinical validation, such hypotheses may be able to ultimately accelerate the path to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with C2S-Scale 27B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new C2S-Scale 27B model and its resources are available today for the research community. We invite you to explore these tools, build on our work and help us continue to translate the language of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the full scientific preprint on bioRxiv.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the model and resources on Hugging Face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access the code on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Called &lt;a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentic Context Engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ACE), the framework automatically populates and modifies the context window of large language model (LLM) applications by treating it as an “evolving playbook” that creates and refines strategies as the agent gains experience in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACE is designed to overcome key limitations of other context-engineering frameworks, preventing the model’s context from degrading as it accumulates more information. Experiments show that ACE works for both optimizing system prompts and managing an agent&amp;#x27;s memory, outperforming other methods while also being significantly more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The challenge of context engineering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced AI applications that use LLMs largely rely on &amp;quot;context adaptation,&amp;quot; or context engineering, to guide their behavior. Instead of the costly process of retraining or fine-tuning the model, developers use the LLM’s &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/fine-tuning-vs-in-context-learning-new-research-guides-better-llm-customization-for-real-world-tasks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in-context learning abilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to guide its behavior by modifying the input prompts with specific instructions, reasoning steps, or domain-specific knowledge. This additional information is usually obtained as the agent interacts with its environment and gathers new data and experience. The key goal of context engineering is to organize this new information in a way that improves the model’s performance and avoids confusing it. This approach is becoming a central paradigm for building capable, scalable, and self-improving AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context engineering has several advantages for enterprise applications. Contexts are interpretable for both users and developers, can be updated with new knowledge at runtime, and can be shared across different models. Context engineering also benefits from ongoing hardware and software advances, such as the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-new-technique-gives-llms-infinite-context"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing context windows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of LLMs and efficient inference techniques like prompt and context caching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various automated context-engineering techniques, but most of them face two key limitations. The first is a “brevity bias,” where prompt optimization methods tend to favor concise, generic instructions over comprehensive, detailed ones. This can undermine performance in complex domains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second, more severe issue is &amp;quot;context collapse.&amp;quot; When an LLM is tasked with repeatedly rewriting its entire accumulated context, it can suffer from a kind of digital amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we call ‘context collapse’ happens when an AI tries to rewrite or compress everything it has learned into a single new version of its prompt or memory,” the researchers said in written comments to VentureBeat. “Over time, that rewriting process erases important details—like overwriting a document so many times that key notes disappear. In customer-facing systems, this could mean a support agent suddenly losing awareness of past interactions... causing erratic or inconsistent behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that “contexts should function not as concise summaries, but as comprehensive, evolving playbooks—detailed, inclusive, and rich with domain insights.” This approach leans into the strength of modern LLMs, which can effectively distill relevance from long and detailed contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACE is a framework for comprehensive context adaptation designed for both offline tasks, like &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-llm-optimization-technique-slashes-memory-costs-up-to-75"&gt;&lt;u&gt;system prompt optimization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and online scenarios, such as real-time memory updates for agents. Rather than compressing information, ACE treats the context like a dynamic playbook that gathers and organizes strategies over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework divides the labor across three specialized roles: a Generator, a Reflector, and a Curator. This modular design is inspired by “how humans learn—experimenting, reflecting, and consolidating—while avoiding the bottleneck of overloading a single model with all responsibilities,” according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow starts with the Generator, which produces reasoning paths for input prompts, highlighting both effective strategies and common mistakes. The Reflector then analyzes these paths to extract key lessons. Finally, the Curator synthesizes these lessons into compact updates and merges them into the existing playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent context collapse and brevity bias, ACE incorporates two key design principles. First, it uses incremental updates. The context is represented as a collection of structured, itemized bullets instead of a single block of text. This allows ACE to make granular changes and retrieve the most relevant information without rewriting the entire context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, ACE uses a “grow-and-refine” mechanism. As new experiences are gathered, new bullets are appended to the playbook and existing ones are updated. A de-duplication step regularly removes redundant entries, ensuring the context remains comprehensive yet relevant and compact over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACE in action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers evaluated ACE on two types of tasks that benefit from evolving context: agent benchmarks requiring multi-turn reasoning and tool use, and domain-specific financial analysis benchmarks demanding specialized knowledge. For high-stakes industries like finance, the benefits extend beyond pure performance. As the researchers said, the framework is “far more transparent: a compliance officer can literally read what the AI learned, since it’s stored in human-readable text rather than hidden in billions of parameters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ACE consistently outperformed strong baselines such as &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/gepa-optimizes-llms-without-costly-reinforcement-learning"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GEPA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and classic in-context learning, achieving average performance gains of 10.6% on agent tasks and 8.6% on domain-specific benchmarks in both offline and online settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, ACE can build effective contexts by analyzing the feedback from its actions and environment instead of requiring manually labeled data. The researchers note that this ability is a &amp;quot;key ingredient for self-improving LLMs and agents.&amp;quot; On the public &lt;a href="https://appworld.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AppWorld&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; benchmark, designed to evaluate agentic systems, an agent using ACE with a smaller open-source model (&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepseek-v3-1-just-dropped-and-it-might-be-the-most-powerful-open-ai-yet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DeepSeek-V3.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) matched the performance of the top-ranked, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4-1-and-4-1-mini-to-chatgpt-what-enterprises-should-know"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPT-4.1-powered agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on average and surpassed it on the more difficult test set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway for businesses is significant. “This means companies don’t have to depend on massive proprietary models to stay competitive,” the research team said. “They can deploy local models, protect sensitive data, and still get top-tier results by continuously refining context instead of retraining weights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond accuracy, ACE proved to be highly efficient. It adapts to new tasks with an average 86.9% lower latency than existing methods and requires fewer steps and tokens. The researchers point out that this efficiency demonstrates that “scalable self-improvement can be achieved with both higher accuracy and lower overhead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises concerned about inference costs, the researchers point out that the longer contexts produced by ACE do not translate to proportionally higher costs. Modern serving infrastructures are increasingly optimized for long-context workloads with techniques like KV cache reuse, compression, and offloading, which amortize the cost of handling extensive context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, ACE points toward a future where AI systems are dynamic and continuously improving. &amp;quot;Today, only AI engineers can update models, but context engineering opens the door for domain experts—lawyers, analysts, doctors—to directly shape what the AI knows by editing its contextual playbook,&amp;quot; the researchers said. This also makes governance more practical. &amp;quot;Selective unlearning becomes much more tractable: if a piece of information is outdated or legally sensitive, it can simply be removed or replaced in the context, without retraining the model.”

Meanwhile, since no one native language is spoken by the majority of the population, training language models is far more complicated than it is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when the open-source foundation model DeepSeek-R1 suddenly outperformed many global peers, it struck a nerve.

In those spots, three conditions naturally align: high temperatures, plentiful water, and rock that’s permeable enough for fluids to circulate through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced geothermal systems aim to replicate those conditions in far more places—producing a steady supply of renewable energy wherever they’re deployed. Fervo Energy uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs capable of delivering enough electricity to power massive data centers and hundreds of thousands of homes.

  &lt;p class="gdm-rich-text__subtitle"&gt;We’re partnering with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to bring clean, safe, limitless fusion energy closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusion, the process that powers the sun, promises clean, abundant energy without long-lived radioactive waste. Making it work here on Earth means keeping an ionized gas, known as plasma, stable at temperatures over 100 million degrees Celsius — all within a fusion energy machine’s limits. This is a highly complex physics problem that we’re working to solve with artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing our research partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a global leader in fusion energy. CFS is pioneering a faster path to clean, safe and effectively limitless fusion energy with its compact, powerful tokamak machine called SPARC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPARC leverages powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets and aims to be the first magnetic fusion machine in history to generate net fusion energy —&amp;nbsp;more power from fusion than it takes to sustain it. That landmark achievement is known as crossing “breakeven,” and a critical milestone on the path to viable fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This partnership builds on our groundbreaking work using AI to successfully control a plasma. With academic partners at the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), we showed that deep reinforcement learning can control the magnets of a tokamak to stabilize complex plasma shapes. To cover a wider range of physics, we developed TORAX, a fast and differentiable plasma simulator written in JAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re bringing that work to CFS to accelerate the timeline to deliver fusion energy to the grid. We’ve been collaborating on three key areas so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Producing a fast, accurate, differentiable simulation of a fusion plasma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding the most efficient and robust path to maximizing fusion energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using reinforcement learning to discover novel real-time control strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of our AI expertise with CFS’s cutting-edge hardware makes this the ideal partnership to advance foundational discoveries in fusion energy for the benefit of the worldwide research community, and ultimately, the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simulating fusion plasma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To optimize the performance of a tokamak, we need to simulate how heat, electric current and matter flow through the core of a plasma and interact with the systems around it. Last year, we released TORAX, an open-source plasma simulator built for optimization and control, expanding the scope of physics questions we could address beyond magnetic simulation. TORAX is built in JAX, so it can run easily on both CPUs and GPUs and can smoothly integrate AI-powered models, including our own, to achieve even better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORAX will help CFS teams test and refine their operating plans by running millions of virtual experiments before SPARC is even turned on. It also gives them flexibility to quickly adapt their plans once the first data arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This software has become a linchpin in CFS’s daily workflows, helping them understand how the plasma will behave under different conditions, saving precious time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;TORAX is a professional, open-source plasma simulator that saved us countless hours in setting up and running our simulation environments for SPARC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Finding the fastest path to maximum energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating a tokamak involves countless choices in how to tune the various “knobs” available, like magnetic coil currents, fuel injection and heating power. Manually finding a tokamak’s optimal settings to produce the most energy, while staying within operating limits, could be very inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using TORAX in combination with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search approaches like AlphaEvolve, our AI agents can explore vast numbers of potential operating scenarios in simulation, rapidly identifying the most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy. This can help CFS focus on the most promising strategies, increasing the probability of success from day one, even before SPARC is fully commissioned and operating at full power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been building the infrastructure to investigate various SPARC scenarios. We can look at maximizing fusion power produced under different constraints, or optimizing for robustness as we learn more about the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we illustrate examples of a standard SPARC pulse simulated in TORAX. Our AI system can assess many possible pulses to find the settings we expect to perform the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Visualizations of a cross section through SPARC. Left: The plasma in fuchsia. Right: An example plasma pulse simulated in TORAX, showing changes in the plasma pressure. Far right: We show that adjusting control commands changes the plasma performance, resulting in different plasma pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through our growing network of collaborations within the fusion research community, we’ll be able to validate and calibrate TORAX against past tokamak data and high-fidelity simulations. This information will provide confidence in simulation accuracy and help us nimbly adapt as soon as SPARC begins operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing an AI pilot for real-time control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our previous work, we showed reinforcement learning can control the magnetic configuration of a tokamak. We’re now increasing complexity by adding simultaneous optimization of more aspects of tokamak performance, such as maximizing fusion power or managing SPARC’s heat load, so it can run at high performance with a greater margin to machine limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running at full power, SPARC will release immense heat concentrated onto a small area that must be carefully managed to protect the solid materials closest to the plasma. One strategy SPARC could use is to magnetically sweep this exhaust energy along the wall, as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the initial phase of our collaboration, we’re investigating how reinforcement learning agents can learn to dynamically control plasma to distribute this heat effectively. In the future, AI could learn adaptive strategies more complex than anything an engineer would craft, especially when balancing multiple constraints and objectives. We could also use reinforcement learning to quickly tune traditional control algorithms for a specific pulse. The combination of pulse optimization and optimal control could push SPARC further and faster to achieve its historic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uniting AI and fusion to build a cleaner future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside our research, Google has invested in CFS, supporting their work on promising scientific and engineering breakthroughs, and moving their technology toward commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, our vision extends beyond optimizing SPARC operations. We’re building the foundations for AI to become an intelligent, adaptive system at the very heart of future fusion power plants. This is just the beginning of our journey together, and we hope to share more details about our collaboration as we reach new milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting the revolutionary potential of AI and fusion, we’re building a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

That landmark achievement is known as crossing “breakeven,” and a critical milestone on the path to viable fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This partnership builds on our groundbreaking work using AI to successfully control a plasma. With academic partners at the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), we showed that deep reinforcement learning can control the magnets of a tokamak to stabilize complex plasma shapes. To cover a wider range of physics, we developed TORAX, a fast and differentiable plasma simulator written in JAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re bringing that work to CFS to accelerate the timeline to deliver fusion energy to the grid. We’ve been collaborating on three key areas so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Producing a fast, accurate, differentiable simulation of a fusion plasma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding the most efficient and robust path to maximizing fusion energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using reinforcement learning to discover novel real-time control strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of our AI expertise with CFS’s cutting-edge hardware makes this the ideal partnership to advance foundational discoveries in fusion energy for the benefit of the worldwide research community, and ultimately, the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simulating fusion plasma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To optimize the performance of a tokamak, we need to simulate how heat, electric current and matter flow through the core of a plasma and interact with the systems around it. Last year, we released TORAX, an open-source plasma simulator built for optimization and control, expanding the scope of physics questions we could address beyond magnetic simulation. TORAX is built in JAX, so it can run easily on both CPUs and GPUs and can smoothly integrate AI-powered models, including our own, to achieve even better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORAX will help CFS teams test and refine their operating plans by running millions of virtual experiments before SPARC is even turned on. It also gives them flexibility to quickly adapt their plans once the first data arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This software has become a linchpin in CFS’s daily workflows, helping them understand how the plasma will behave under different conditions, saving precious time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TORAX is a professional, open-source plasma simulator that saved us countless hours in setting up and running our simulation environments for SPARC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Finding the fastest path to maximum energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating a tokamak involves countless choices in how to tune the various “knobs” available, like magnetic coil currents, fuel injection and heating power. Manually finding a tokamak’s optimal settings to produce the most energy, while staying within operating limits, could be very inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using TORAX in combination with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search approaches like AlphaEvolve, our AI agents can explore vast numbers of potential operating scenarios in simulation, rapidly identifying the most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy. This can help CFS focus on the most promising strategies, increasing the probability of success from day one, even before SPARC is fully commissioned and operating at full power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been building the infrastructure to investigate various SPARC scenarios. We can look at maximizing fusion power produced under different constraints, or optimizing for robustness as we learn more about the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we illustrate examples of a standard SPARC pulse simulated in TORAX. Our AI system can assess many possible pulses to find the settings we expect to perform the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Visualizations of a cross section through SPARC. Left: The plasma in fuchsia. Right: An example plasma pulse simulated in TORAX, showing changes in the plasma pressure. Far right: We show that adjusting control commands changes the plasma performance, resulting in different plasma pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
                
              
                
                
                  
                  &lt;div class="gdm-rich-text rich-text flex-font"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through our growing network of collaborations within the fusion research community, we’ll be able to validate and calibrate TORAX against past tokamak data and high-fidelity simulations. This information will provide confidence in simulation accuracy and help us nimbly adapt as soon as SPARC begins operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing an AI pilot for real-time control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our previous work, we showed reinforcement learning can control the magnetic configuration of a tokamak. We’re now increasing complexity by adding simultaneous optimization of more aspects of tokamak performance, such as maximizing fusion power or managing SPARC’s heat load, so it can run at high performance with a greater margin to machine limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running at full power, SPARC will release immense heat concentrated onto a small area that must be carefully managed to protect the solid materials closest to the plasma. One strategy SPARC could use is to magnetically sweep this exhaust energy along the wall, as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the initial phase of our collaboration, we’re investigating how reinforcement learning agents can learn to dynamically control plasma to distribute this heat effectively. In the future, AI could learn adaptive strategies more complex than anything an engineer would craft, especially when balancing multiple constraints and objectives. We could also use reinforcement learning to quickly tune traditional control algorithms for a specific pulse. The combination of pulse optimization and optimal control could push SPARC further and faster to achieve its historic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uniting AI and fusion to build a cleaner future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside our research, Google has invested in CFS, supporting their work on promising scientific and engineering breakthroughs, and moving their technology toward commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, our vision extends beyond optimizing SPARC operations. We’re building the foundations for AI to become an intelligent, adaptive system at the very heart of future fusion power plants. This is just the beginning of our journey together, and we hope to share more details about our collaboration as we reach new milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting the revolutionary potential of AI and fusion, we’re building a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Second, it should be able to see what you see and be able to offer guided support. And third, it should be able to take action on your behalf.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift could prove consequential for an industry searching for the &amp;quot;killer app&amp;quot; for generative AI. While hundreds of millions of people have experimented with ChatGPT and similar chatbots, integrating AI directly into the operating system that powers the vast majority of workplace computers could dramatically accelerate mainstream adoption — or create new security and privacy headaches for organizations already &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;&lt;u&gt;struggling to govern employee use of AI tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;Hey Copilot&amp;#x27; aims to replace typing with talking on Windows PCs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Microsoft&amp;#x27;s vision is &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voice interaction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which the company is positioning as the third fundamental input method for PCs after the mouse and keyboard — a comparison that underscores Microsoft&amp;#x27;s ambitions for reshaping human-computer interaction nearly four decades after the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/12/web-101-a-history-of-the-gui/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;graphical user interface&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting this week, any &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windows 11&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; user can enable the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hey Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; wake word with a single click, allowing them to summon Microsoft&amp;#x27;s AI assistant by voice from anywhere in the operating system. The feature, which had been in limited testing, is now being rolled out to hundreds of millions of devices globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s been almost four decades since the PC has changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,&amp;quot; Mehdi said. &amp;quot;When you think about it, we find that people type on a given day up to 14,000 words on their keyboard, which is really kind of mind-boggling. But what if now you can go beyond that and talk to it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on voice reflects internal Microsoft data showing that users engage with Copilot twice as much when using voice compared to text input — a finding the company attributes to the lower cognitive barrier of speaking versus crafting precise written prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The magic unlock with &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/do-more-with-ai/general-ai/what-is-copilot-voice"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the ease of interaction,&amp;quot; according to the company&amp;#x27;s announcement. &amp;quot;Using the new wake word, &amp;#x27;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hey Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#x27; getting something done is as easy as just asking for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft&amp;#x27;s bet on voice computing faces real-world constraints that Mehdi acknowledged during the briefing. When asked whether workers in shared office environments would use voice features, potentially compromising privacy, Mehdi noted that millions already conduct voice calls through their PCs with headphones, and predicted users would adapt: &amp;quot;Just like when the mouse came out, people have to figure out when to use it, what&amp;#x27;s the right way, how to make it happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Microsoft is hedging its voice-first strategy by making all features accessible through traditional text input as well, recognizing that voice isn&amp;#x27;t always appropriate or accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI that sees your screen: Copilot Vision expands worldwide with new capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more transformative than voice control is the expansion of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Microsoft introduced earlier this year that allows the AI to analyze what&amp;#x27;s displayed on a user&amp;#x27;s screen and provide contextual assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously limited to voice interaction, Copilot Vision is now rolling out worldwide with a new text-based interface, allowing users to type questions about what they&amp;#x27;re viewing rather than speaking them aloud. The feature can now access full document context in &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; applications — meaning it can analyze an entire PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet without the user needing to scroll through every page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With 68 percent of consumers reporting using AI to support their decision making, voice is making this easier,&amp;quot; Microsoft explained in its announcement. &amp;quot;The magic unlock with Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision is the ease of interaction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the press briefing, Microsoft demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helping users navigate Spotify&amp;#x27;s settings to enable lossless audio streaming, coaching an artist through writing a professional bio based on their visual portfolio, and providing shopping recommendations based on products visible in YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What brings AI to life is when you can give it rich context, when you can type great prompts,&amp;quot; Mehdi explained. &amp;quot;The big challenge for the majority of people is we&amp;#x27;ve been trained with search to do the opposite. We&amp;#x27;ve been trained to essentially type in fewer keywords, because it turns out the less keywords you type on search, the better your answers are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that average search queries remain just 2.3 keywords, while AI systems perform better with detailed prompts — creating a disconnect between user habits and AI capabilities. Copilot Vision aims to bridge that gap by automatically gathering visual context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With Copilot Vision, you can simply share your screen and Copilot in literally milliseconds can understand everything on the screen and then provide intelligence,&amp;quot; Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision capabilities work with any application without requiring developers to build specific integrations, using computer vision to interpret on-screen content — a powerful capability that also raises questions about what the AI can access and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Software robots take control: Inside Copilot Actions&amp;#x27; controversial autonomy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most ambitious—and potentially controversial—new capability is &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Actions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an experimental feature that allows AI to take control of a user&amp;#x27;s computer to complete tasks autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming first to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windows Insiders enrolled in Copilot Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the feature builds on Microsoft&amp;#x27;s May announcement of Copilot Actions on the web, extending the capability to manipulate local files and applications on Windows PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During demonstrations, Microsoft showed the AI agent organizing photo libraries, extracting data from documents, and working through multi-step tasks while users attended to other work. The agent operates in a separate, sandboxed environment and provides running commentary on its actions, with users able to take control at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As a general-purpose agent — simply describe the task you want to complete in your own words, and the agent will attempt to complete it by interacting with desktop and web applications,&amp;quot; according to the announcement. &amp;quot;While this is happening, you can choose to focus on other tasks. At any time, you can take over the task or check in on the progress of the action, including reviewing what actions have been taken.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navjot Burke, Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Windows Experience Leader, acknowledged the technology&amp;#x27;s current limitations during the briefing. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ll be starting with a narrow set of use cases while we optimize model performance and learn,&amp;quot; Burke said. &amp;quot;You may see the agent make mistakes or encounter challenges with complex interfaces, which is why real-world testing of this experience is so critical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental nature of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Actions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reflects broader industry challenges with agentic AI — systems that can take actions rather than simply providing information. While the potential productivity gains are substantial, AI systems still occasionally &amp;quot;hallucinate&amp;quot; incorrect information and can be vulnerable to novel attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can AI agents be trusted? Microsoft&amp;#x27;s new security framework explained&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the security implications of giving AI control over users&amp;#x27; computers and files, Microsoft introduced a new security framework built on four core principles: user control, operational transparency, limited privileges, and privacy-preserving design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to this approach is the concept of &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/agents"&gt;&lt;u&gt;agent accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — separate Windows user accounts under which AI agents operate, distinct from the human user&amp;#x27;s account. Combined with a new &amp;quot;agent workspace&amp;quot; that provides a sandboxed desktop environment, the architecture aims to create clear boundaries around what agents can access and modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Waxman, Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Windows Security Engineering Leader, emphasized that Copilot Actions is disabled by default and requires explicit user opt-in. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re always in control of what Copilot Actions can do,&amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;quot;Copilot Actions is turned off by default and you&amp;#x27;re able to pause, take control, or disable it at any time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During operation, users can monitor the agent&amp;#x27;s progress in real-time, and the system requests additional approval before taking &amp;quot;sensitive or important&amp;quot; actions. All agent activity occurs under the dedicated agent account, creating an audit trail that distinguishes AI actions from human ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the agent will have default access to users&amp;#x27; Documents, Downloads, Desktop, and Pictures folders—a broad permission grant that could concern enterprise IT administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Huang, Corporate Vice President for Windows Security, acknowledged in a blog post that &amp;quot;agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft promises more details about enterprise controls at its &lt;a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ignite conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaming, taskbar redesign, and deeper Office integration round out updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond voice and autonomous agents, Microsoft introduced changes across Windows 11&amp;#x27;s core interfaces and extended AI to new domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11?r=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ask Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; feature integrates AI directly into the Windows taskbar, providing one-click access to start conversations, activate vision capabilities, or search for files and settings with &amp;quot;lightning-fast&amp;quot; results. The opt-in feature doesn&amp;#x27;t replace traditional Windows search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File Explorer gains AI capabilities through integration with third-party services. A partnership with Manus AI allows users to right-click on local image files and generate complete websites without manual uploading or coding.

Once connected, users can query personal content across platforms using natural language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notable expansion beyond productivity, Microsoft and Xbox introduced Gaming Copilot for the &lt;a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ROG Xbox Ally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; handheld gaming devices developed with ASUS. The feature, accessible via a dedicated hardware button, provides an AI assistant that can answer gameplay questions, offer strategic advice, and help navigate game interfaces through natural voice conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Microsoft is racing to embed AI everywhere before Apple and Google&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s announcement comes as technology giants race to embed generative AI into their core products following the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. While Microsoft moved quickly to &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrate OpenAI&amp;#x27;s technology into Bing search&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and introduce Copilot across its product line, the company has faced questions about whether AI features are driving meaningful engagement. Recent data shows &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bing&amp;#x27;s search market share&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remaining largely flat despite AI integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows integration represents a different approach: rather than charging separately for AI features, Microsoft is building them into the operating system itself, betting that embedded AI will drive Windows 11 adoption and competitive differentiation against Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has taken a more cautious approach with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, introducing AI features gradually and emphasizing privacy through on-device processing. Google has integrated AI across its services but has faced challenges with accuracy and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, while Microsoft highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-plus-pcs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new Copilot+ PC models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from partners with prices ranging from $649.99 to $1,499.99, the core AI features announced today &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;work on any Windows 11 PC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a significant departure from earlier positioning that suggested AI capabilities required new hardware with specialized neural processing units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything we showed you here is for all Windows 11 PCs. You don&amp;#x27;t need to run it on a copilot plus PC. It works on any Windows 11 PC,&amp;quot; Mehdi clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This democratization of AI features across the Windows 11 installed base potentially accelerates adoption but also complicates Microsoft&amp;#x27;s hardware sales pitch for premium devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Microsoft&amp;#x27;s AI bet means for the future of computing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi framed the announcement in sweeping terms, describing Microsoft&amp;#x27;s goal as fundamentally reimagining the operating system for the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re taking kind of a bold view of it. We really feel that the vision that we have is, let&amp;#x27;s rewrite the entire operating system around AI and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the success of &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI-powered Windows 11&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could help drive the company&amp;#x27;s next phase of growth as PC sales have matured and cloud growth faces increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users and organizations, the announcement represents a potential inflection point in how humans interact with computers — one that could significantly boost productivity if executed well, or create new security headaches if the AI proves unreliable or difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology industry will be watching closely to see whether Microsoft&amp;#x27;s bet on conversational computing and agentic AI marks the beginning of a genuine paradigm shift, or proves to be another ambitious interface reimagining that fails to gain mainstream traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s clear is that Microsoft is moving aggressively to stake its claim as the leader in AI-powered personal computing, leveraging its dominant position in desktop operating systems to bring generative AI directly into the daily workflows of potentially a billion users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot Voice and Vision are &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;available today&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Windows 11 users worldwide, with experimental capabilities coming to Windows Insiders in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is fundamentally reimagining how people interact with their computers, announcing Thursday a sweeping transformation of &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windows 11&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that brings voice-activated AI assistants, autonomous software agents, and contextual intelligence to every PC running the operating system — not just premium devices with specialized chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement represents &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s most aggressive push yet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to integrate generative artificial intelligence into the desktop computing experience, moving beyond the chatbot interfaces that have defined the first wave of consumer AI products toward a more ambient, conversational model where users can simply talk to their computers and have AI agents complete complex tasks on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When we think about what the promise of an AI PC is, it should be capable of three things,&amp;quot; Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Executive Vice President and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer, told reporters at a press conference last week. &amp;quot;First, you should be able to interact with it naturally, in text or voice, and have it understand you. Second, it should be able to see what you see and be able to offer guided support. And third, it should be able to take action on your behalf.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift could prove consequential for an industry searching for the &amp;quot;killer app&amp;quot; for generative AI. While hundreds of millions of people have experimented with ChatGPT and similar chatbots, integrating AI directly into the operating system that powers the vast majority of workplace computers could dramatically accelerate mainstream adoption — or create new security and privacy headaches for organizations already &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;&lt;u&gt;struggling to govern employee use of AI tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;Hey Copilot&amp;#x27; aims to replace typing with talking on Windows PCs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Microsoft&amp;#x27;s vision is &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voice interaction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which the company is positioning as the third fundamental input method for PCs after the mouse and keyboard — a comparison that underscores Microsoft&amp;#x27;s ambitions for reshaping human-computer interaction nearly four decades after the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/12/web-101-a-history-of-the-gui/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;graphical user interface&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting this week, any &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windows 11&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; user can enable the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hey Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; wake word with a single click, allowing them to summon Microsoft&amp;#x27;s AI assistant by voice from anywhere in the operating system. The feature, which had been in limited testing, is now being rolled out to hundreds of millions of devices globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s been almost four decades since the PC has changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,&amp;quot; Mehdi said. &amp;quot;When you think about it, we find that people type on a given day up to 14,000 words on their keyboard, which is really kind of mind-boggling. But what if now you can go beyond that and talk to it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on voice reflects internal Microsoft data showing that users engage with Copilot twice as much when using voice compared to text input — a finding the company attributes to the lower cognitive barrier of speaking versus crafting precise written prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The magic unlock with &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/do-more-with-ai/general-ai/what-is-copilot-voice"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Voice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the ease of interaction,&amp;quot; according to the company&amp;#x27;s announcement. &amp;quot;Using the new wake word, &amp;#x27;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hey Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#x27; getting something done is as easy as just asking for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft&amp;#x27;s bet on voice computing faces real-world constraints that Mehdi acknowledged during the briefing. When asked whether workers in shared office environments would use voice features, potentially compromising privacy, Mehdi noted that millions already conduct voice calls through their PCs with headphones, and predicted users would adapt: &amp;quot;Just like when the mouse came out, people have to figure out when to use it, what&amp;#x27;s the right way, how to make it happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Microsoft is hedging its voice-first strategy by making all features accessible through traditional text input as well, recognizing that voice isn&amp;#x27;t always appropriate or accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI that sees your screen: Copilot Vision expands worldwide with new capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more transformative than voice control is the expansion of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Microsoft introduced earlier this year that allows the AI to analyze what&amp;#x27;s displayed on a user&amp;#x27;s screen and provide contextual assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously limited to voice interaction, Copilot Vision is now rolling out worldwide with a new text-based interface, allowing users to type questions about what they&amp;#x27;re viewing rather than speaking them aloud. The feature can now access full document context in &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; applications — meaning it can analyze an entire PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet without the user needing to scroll through every page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With 68 percent of consumers reporting using AI to support their decision making, voice is making this easier,&amp;quot; Microsoft explained in its announcement. &amp;quot;The magic unlock with Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision is the ease of interaction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the press briefing, Microsoft demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helping users navigate Spotify&amp;#x27;s settings to enable lossless audio streaming, coaching an artist through writing a professional bio based on their visual portfolio, and providing shopping recommendations based on products visible in YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What brings AI to life is when you can give it rich context, when you can type great prompts,&amp;quot; Mehdi explained. &amp;quot;The big challenge for the majority of people is we&amp;#x27;ve been trained with search to do the opposite. We&amp;#x27;ve been trained to essentially type in fewer keywords, because it turns out the less keywords you type on search, the better your answers are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that average search queries remain just 2.3 keywords, while AI systems perform better with detailed prompts — creating a disconnect between user habits and AI capabilities. Copilot Vision aims to bridge that gap by automatically gathering visual context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With Copilot Vision, you can simply share your screen and Copilot in literally milliseconds can understand everything on the screen and then provide intelligence,&amp;quot; Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision capabilities work with any application without requiring developers to build specific integrations, using computer vision to interpret on-screen content — a powerful capability that also raises questions about what the AI can access and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Software robots take control: Inside Copilot Actions&amp;#x27; controversial autonomy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most ambitious—and potentially controversial—new capability is &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Actions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an experimental feature that allows AI to take control of a user&amp;#x27;s computer to complete tasks autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming first to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windows Insiders enrolled in Copilot Labs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the feature builds on Microsoft&amp;#x27;s May announcement of Copilot Actions on the web, extending the capability to manipulate local files and applications on Windows PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During demonstrations, Microsoft showed the AI agent organizing photo libraries, extracting data from documents, and working through multi-step tasks while users attended to other work. The agent operates in a separate, sandboxed environment and provides running commentary on its actions, with users able to take control at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As a general-purpose agent — simply describe the task you want to complete in your own words, and the agent will attempt to complete it by interacting with desktop and web applications,&amp;quot; according to the announcement. &amp;quot;While this is happening, you can choose to focus on other tasks. At any time, you can take over the task or check in on the progress of the action, including reviewing what actions have been taken.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navjot Burke, Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Windows Experience Leader, acknowledged the technology&amp;#x27;s current limitations during the briefing. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ll be starting with a narrow set of use cases while we optimize model performance and learn,&amp;quot; Burke said. &amp;quot;You may see the agent make mistakes or encounter challenges with complex interfaces, which is why real-world testing of this experience is so critical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental nature of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Actions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reflects broader industry challenges with agentic AI — systems that can take actions rather than simply providing information. While the potential productivity gains are substantial, AI systems still occasionally &amp;quot;hallucinate&amp;quot; incorrect information and can be vulnerable to novel attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can AI agents be trusted? Microsoft&amp;#x27;s new security framework explained&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the security implications of giving AI control over users&amp;#x27; computers and files, Microsoft introduced a new security framework built on four core principles: user control, operational transparency, limited privileges, and privacy-preserving design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to this approach is the concept of &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/agents"&gt;&lt;u&gt;agent accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — separate Windows user accounts under which AI agents operate, distinct from the human user&amp;#x27;s account. Combined with a new &amp;quot;agent workspace&amp;quot; that provides a sandboxed desktop environment, the architecture aims to create clear boundaries around what agents can access and modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Waxman, Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Windows Security Engineering Leader, emphasized that Copilot Actions is disabled by default and requires explicit user opt-in. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re always in control of what Copilot Actions can do,&amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;quot;Copilot Actions is turned off by default and you&amp;#x27;re able to pause, take control, or disable it at any time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During operation, users can monitor the agent&amp;#x27;s progress in real-time, and the system requests additional approval before taking &amp;quot;sensitive or important&amp;quot; actions. All agent activity occurs under the dedicated agent account, creating an audit trail that distinguishes AI actions from human ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the agent will have default access to users&amp;#x27; Documents, Downloads, Desktop, and Pictures folders—a broad permission grant that could concern enterprise IT administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Huang, Corporate Vice President for Windows Security, acknowledged in a blog post that &amp;quot;agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft promises more details about enterprise controls at its &lt;a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ignite conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaming, taskbar redesign, and deeper Office integration round out updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond voice and autonomous agents, Microsoft introduced changes across Windows 11&amp;#x27;s core interfaces and extended AI to new domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11?r=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ask Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; feature integrates AI directly into the Windows taskbar, providing one-click access to start conversations, activate vision capabilities, or search for files and settings with &amp;quot;lightning-fast&amp;quot; results. The opt-in feature doesn&amp;#x27;t replace traditional Windows search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File Explorer gains AI capabilities through integration with third-party services. A partnership with Manus AI allows users to right-click on local image files and generate complete websites without manual uploading or coding. Integration with Filmora enables quick jumps into video editing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also introduced &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-copilot-connector"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot Connectors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to link cloud services like OneDrive, Outlook, Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar directly to Copilot on Windows. Once connected, users can query personal content across platforms using natural language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notable expansion beyond productivity, Microsoft and Xbox introduced Gaming Copilot for the &lt;a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ROG Xbox Ally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; handheld gaming devices developed with ASUS. The feature, accessible via a dedicated hardware button, provides an AI assistant that can answer gameplay questions, offer strategic advice, and help navigate game interfaces through natural voice conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Microsoft is racing to embed AI everywhere before Apple and Google&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s announcement comes as technology giants race to embed generative AI into their core products following the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT.

In partnership with Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin, the streamer said it would develop “responsible AI” products that respect copyright, but also allow the artists to choose whether or not they want to allow the use of AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spotify didn’t delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band’s music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify also said it would adopt the music labeling system DDEX to label when AI was used as part of the music creation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The upcoming gen AI features follow that promise by allowing artists to opt in to using AI tools if they choose. In all likelihood, the upcoming system would allow artists to identify when their music is used in AI-generated tracks and collect some sort of payment. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rightsholders and distributors over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential,” Spotify shared in its announcementment. “If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem. It says work on the first products has already started, and more tools will be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spotify-app-GettyImages-1689920063-e1702479483636.jpeg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Spotify on Thursday announced a series of deals with major record labels to develop new AI products designed ensure fair compensation and center artists and songwriters in the experience. In partnership with Sony, Universal, Warner, and Merlin, the streamer said it would develop “responsible AI” products that respect copyright, but also allow the artists to choose whether or not they want to allow the use of AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spotify didn’t delve into the specifics of how the new tools would operate, but the company already offers generative AI experiences for users, including with its AI DJ that plays a personalized selection of songs and others that allow users to request playlists using AI prompts, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spotify was recently criticized for allowing an AI-generated band’s music to go viral on its service, raising questions about whether the future of music would push human artistry to the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the company revamped its AI policy to cut down on spam, particularly users who upload AI content at mass scale, create duplicates, and manipulate the search and recommendations systems. Spotify also said it would adopt the music labeling system DDEX to label when AI was used as part of the music creation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The upcoming gen AI features follow that promise by allowing artists to opt in to using AI tools if they choose. In all likelihood, the upcoming system would allow artists to identify when their music is used in AI-generated tracks and collect some sort of payment. Spotify notes the system will expand beyond artists to include other rightsholders and distributors over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential,” Spotify shared in its announcementment. “If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development,” it read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Spotify said it has begun building a generative AI research lab and product team focused on building out new technologies that reflect its principles that artists should be able to choose if and how they participate in the AI music ecosystem. It says work on the first products has already started, and more tools will be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

The round, led by &lt;a href="https://www.bvp.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bessemer Venture Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with participation from &lt;a href="https://www.decibel.vc/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Decibel Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/strategy/future-back-ventures/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bain Future Back Ventures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mvp-vc.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MVP Ventures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://645ventures.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;645 Ventures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes as enterprises increasingly turn to artificial intelligence to understand customers faster and more deeply than traditional methods allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment marks a sharp acceleration for the startup founded by Lydia Hylton and Priya Krishnan, two former consultants and product managers who watched companies struggle with a customer research process that could take eight weeks from start to finish. Since October, Strella has grown revenue tenfold, quadrupled its customer base to more than 40 paying enterprises, and tripled its average contract values by moving upmarket to serve Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Research tends to be bookended by two very strategic steps: first, we have a problem—what research should we do? And second, we&amp;#x27;ve done the research—now what are we going to do with it?&amp;quot; said Hylton, Strella&amp;#x27;s CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;All the stuff in the middle tends to be execution and lower-skill work. We view Strella as doing that middle 90% of the work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform now serves &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Duolingo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apollo GraphQL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.chobani.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chobani&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, collectively conducting thousands of AI-moderated interviews that deliver what the company claims is a 90% average time savings on manual research work. The company is approaching $1 million in revenue after beginning monetization only in January, with month-over-month growth of 50% and zero customer churn to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AI-powered interviews compress eight-week research projects into days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strella&amp;#x27;s technology addresses a workflow that has frustrated product teams, marketers, and designers for decades. Traditional customer research requires writing interview guides, recruiting participants, scheduling calls, conducting interviews, taking notes, synthesizing findings, and creating presentations — a process that consumes weeks of highly-skilled labor and often delays critical product decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform compresses that timeline to days by using AI to moderate voice-based interviews that run like Zoom calls, but with an artificial intelligence agent asking questions, following up on interesting responses, and detecting when participants are being evasive or fraudulent. The system then synthesizes findings automatically, creating highlight reels and charts from unstructured qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It used to take eight weeks. Now you can do it in the span of a couple days,&amp;quot; Hylton told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The primary technology is through an AI-moderated interview. It&amp;#x27;s like being in a Zoom call with an AI instead of a human — it&amp;#x27;s completely free form and voice based.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, the platform also supports human moderators joining the same calls, reflecting the founders&amp;#x27; belief that humans won&amp;#x27;t disappear from the research process. &amp;quot;Human moderation won&amp;#x27;t go away, which is why we&amp;#x27;ve supported human moderation from our Genesis,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;Research tends to be bookended by two very strategic steps: we have a problem, what&amp;#x27;s the research that we should do? And we&amp;#x27;ve done the research, now what are we going to do with it? All the stuff in the middle tends to be execution and lower skill work. We view Strella as doing that middle 90% of the work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why customers tell AI moderators the truth they won&amp;#x27;t share with humans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Strella&amp;#x27;s most surprising findings challenges assumptions about AI in qualitative research: participants appear more honest with AI moderators than with humans. The founders discovered this pattern repeatedly as customers ran head-to-head comparisons between traditional human-moderated studies and Strella&amp;#x27;s AI approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a designer and you get on a Zoom call with a customer and you say, &amp;#x27;Do you like my design?&amp;#x27; they&amp;#x27;re always gonna say yes. They don&amp;#x27;t want to hurt your feelings,&amp;quot; Hylton explained. &amp;quot;But it&amp;#x27;s not a problem at all for Strella. They would tell you exactly what they think about it, which is really valuable. It&amp;#x27;s very hard to get honest feedback.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnan, Strella&amp;#x27;s COO, said companies initially worried about using AI and &amp;quot;eroding quality,&amp;quot; but the platform has &amp;quot;actually found the opposite to be true. People are much more open and honest with an AI moderator, and so the level of insight that you get is much richer because people are giving their unfiltered feedback.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic has practical business implications. Brian Santiago, Senior Product Design Manager at Apollo GraphQL, said in a statement: &amp;quot;Before Strella, studies took weeks. Now we get insights in a day — sometimes in just a few hours. And because participants open up more with the AI moderator, the feedback is deeper and more honest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also addresses endemic fraud in online surveys, particularly when participants are compensated. Because Strella interviews happen on camera in real time, the AI moderator can detect when someone pauses suspiciously long — perhaps to consult ChatGPT — and flags them as potentially fraudulent. &amp;quot;We are fraud resistant,&amp;quot; Hylton said, contrasting this with traditional surveys where fraud rates can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solving mobile app research with persistent screen sharing technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major focus of the Series A funding will be expanding &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strella-mobile-interview/id6746277771"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strella&amp;#x27;s recently-launched mobile application&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Krishnan identified as critical competitive differentiation. The mobile app enables persistent screen sharing during interviews — allowing researchers to watch users navigate mobile applications in real time while the AI moderator asks about their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are the only player in the market that supports screen sharing on mobile,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;You know, I want to understand what are the pain points with my app? Why do people not seem to be able to find the checkout flow? Well, in order to do that effectively, you&amp;#x27;d like to see the user screen while they&amp;#x27;re doing an interview.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumer-facing companies where mobile represents the primary customer interface, this capability opens entirely new use cases. The founders noted that &amp;quot;several of our customers didn&amp;#x27;t do research before&amp;quot; but have now built research practices around Strella because the platform finally made mobile research accessible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also supports embedding traditional survey question types directly into the conversational interview, approaching what Hylton called &amp;quot;feature parity with a survey&amp;quot; while maintaining the engagement advantages of a natural conversation. Strella interviews regularly run 60 to 90 minutes with nearly 100% completion rates—a duration that would see 60-70% drop-off in a traditional survey format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Strella differentiated in a market crowded with AI research startups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strella enters a market that appears crowded at first glance, with established players like &lt;a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a wave of AI-powered startups promising to transform customer research. The founders themselves initially pursued a different approach — synthetic respondents, or &amp;quot;digital twins&amp;quot; that simulate customer perspectives using large language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We actually pivoted from that. That was our initial idea,&amp;quot; Hylton revealed, referring to synthetic respondents. &amp;quot;People are very intrigued by that concept, but found in practice, no willingness to pay right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggesting companies &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/this-new-ai-technique-creates-digital-twin-consumers-and-it-could-kill-the"&gt;&lt;u&gt;could use language models as digital twins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for customer feedback has reignited interest in that approach. But Hylton remains skeptical: &amp;quot;The capabilities of the LLMs as they are today are not good enough, in my opinion, to justify a standalone company. Right now you could just ask ChatGPT, &amp;#x27;What would new users of Duolingo think about this ad copy?&amp;#x27; You can do that. Adding the standalone idea of a synthetic panel is sort of just putting a wrapper on that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Strella&amp;#x27;s bet is that the real value lies in collecting proprietary qualitative data at scale — building what could become &amp;quot;the system of truth for all qualitative insights&amp;quot; within enterprises, as Lindsey Li, Vice President at Bessemer Venture Partners, described it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li, who led the investment just one year after Strella emerged from stealth, said the firm was convinced by both the technology and the team. &amp;quot;Strella has built highly differentiated technology that enables a continuous interview rather than a survey,&amp;quot; Li said. &amp;quot;We heard time and time again that customers loved this product experience relative to other offerings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the defensibility question that concerns many AI investors, Li emphasized product execution over patents: &amp;quot;We think the long game here will be won with a million small product decisions, all of which must be driven by deep empathy for customer pain and an understanding of how best to address their needs. Lydia and Priya exhibit that in spades.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders point to technical depth that&amp;#x27;s difficult to replicate. Most competitors started with adaptive surveys — text-based interfaces where users type responses and wait for the next question. Some have added voice, but typically as uploaded audio clips rather than free-flowing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our approach is fundamentally better, which is the fact that it is a free form conversation,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;You never have to control anything. You&amp;#x27;re never typing, there&amp;#x27;s no buttons, there&amp;#x27;s no upload and wait for the next question. It&amp;#x27;s completely free form, and that has been an extraordinarily hard product to build. There&amp;#x27;s a tremendous amount of IP in the way that we prompt our moderator, the way that we run analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also improves with use, learning from each customer&amp;#x27;s research patterns to fine-tune future interview guides and questions. &amp;quot;Our product gets better for our customers as they continue to use us,&amp;quot; Hylton said. All research accumulates in a central repository where teams can generate new insights by chatting with the data or creating visualizations from previously unstructured qualitative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating new research budgets instead of just automating existing ones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more important than displacing existing research is expanding the total market. Krishnan said growth has been &amp;quot;fundamentally related to our product&amp;quot; creating new research that wouldn&amp;#x27;t have happened otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have expanded the use cases in which people would conduct research,&amp;quot; Krishnan explained. &amp;quot;Several of our customers didn&amp;#x27;t do research before, have always wanted to do research, but didn&amp;#x27;t have a dedicated researcher or team at their company that was devoted to it, and have purchased Strella to kick off and enable their research practice. That&amp;#x27;s been really cool where we&amp;#x27;ve seen this market just opening up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expansion comes as enterprises face mounting pressure to improve customer experience amid declining satisfaction scores. According to &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-2024-us-customer-experience-index/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forrester Research&amp;#x27;s 2024 Customer Experience Index&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, customer experience quality has declined for three consecutive years — an unprecedented trend. The report found that 39% of brands saw CX quality deteriorate, with declines across effectiveness, ease, and emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&amp;#x27;s 2025 Technology, Media &amp;amp; Telecommunications Predictions report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forecasts that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents by 2025, growing to 50% by 2027. The report specifically highlighted AI&amp;#x27;s potential to enhance customer satisfaction by 15-20% while reducing cost to serve by 20-30% when properly implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-08-30-gartner-reveals-three-technologies-that-will-transform-customer-service-and-support-by-2028"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gartner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identified conversational user interfaces — the category Strella inhabits — as one of three technologies poised to transform customer service by 2028, noting that &amp;quot;customers increasingly expect to be able to interact with the applications they use in a natural way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Li sees substantial room for growth. &amp;quot;UX Research is a sub-sector of the $140B+ global market-research industry,&amp;quot; Li said. &amp;quot;This includes both the software layer historically (~$430M) and professional services spend on UX research, design, product strategy, etc. which is conservatively estimated to be ~$6.4B+ annually. As software in this vertical, led by Strella, becomes more powerful, we believe the TAM will continue to expand meaningfully.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making customer feedback accessible across the enterprise, not just research teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders describe their mission as &amp;quot;democratizing access to the customer&amp;quot; — making it possible for anyone in an organization to understand customer perspectives without waiting for dedicated research teams to complete months-long studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many, many, many positions in the organization would like to get customer feedback, but it&amp;#x27;s so hard right now,&amp;quot; Hylton said. With Strella, she explained, someone can &amp;quot;log into Strella and through a chat, create any highlight reel that you want and actually see customers in their own words answering the question that you have based on the research that&amp;#x27;s already been done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This video-first approach to research repositories changes organizational dynamics around customer feedback. &amp;quot;Then you can say, &amp;#x27;Okay, engineering team, we need to build this feature. And here&amp;#x27;s the customer actually saying it,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; Hylton continued. &amp;quot;&amp;#x27;This is not me. This isn&amp;#x27;t politics. Here are seven customers saying they can&amp;#x27;t find the Checkout button.&amp;#x27; The fact that we are a very video-based platform really allows us to do that quickly and painlessly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has moved decisively upmarket, with contract values now typically in the five-figure range and &amp;quot;several six figure contracts&amp;quot; signed, according to Krishnan. The pricing strategy reflects a premium positioning: &amp;quot;Our product is very good, it&amp;#x27;s very premium. We&amp;#x27;re charging based on the value it provides to customers,&amp;quot; Krishnan said, rather than competing on cost alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach appears to be working. The company reports 100% conversion from pilot programs to paid contracts and zero churn among its 40-45 customers, with month-over-month revenue growth of 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The roadmap: Computer vision, agentic AI, and human-machine collaboration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Series A funding will primarily support scaling product and go-to-market teams. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re really confident that we have product-market fit,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;And now the question is execution, and we want to hire a lot of really talented people to help us execute.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the product roadmap, Hylton emphasized continued focus on the participant experience as the key to winning the market. &amp;quot;Everything else is downstream of a joyful participant experience,&amp;quot; she said, including &amp;quot;the quality of insights, the amount you have to pay people to do the interviews, and the way that your customers feel about a company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near-term priorities include adding visual capabilities so the AI moderator can respond to facial expressions and other nonverbal cues, and building more sophisticated collaboration features between human researchers and AI moderators. &amp;quot;Maybe you want to listen while an AI moderator is running a call and you might want to be able to jump in with specific questions,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;Or you want to run an interview yourself, but you want the moderator to be there as backup or to help you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features move toward what the industry calls &amp;quot;agentic AI&amp;quot; — systems that can act more autonomously while still collaborating with humans. The founders see this human-AI collaboration, rather than full automation, as the sustainable path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We believe that a lot of the really strategic work that companies do will continue to be human moderated,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;And you can still do that through Strella and just use us for synthesis in those cases.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Li and Bessemer, the bet is on founders who understand this nuance. &amp;quot;Lydia and Priya exhibit the exact archetype of founders we are excited to partner with for the long term — customer-obsessed, transparent, thoughtful, and singularly driven towards the home-run scenario,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to disclose specific revenue figures or valuation. With the new funding, Strella has now raised $18 million total, including a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/strella-raises-4-million-to-automate-market-research-with-ai-powered-customer-interviews"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$4 million seed round led by Decibel Partners announced in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Strella scales, the founders remain focused on a vision where technology enhances rather than eliminates human judgment—where an engineering team doesn&amp;#x27;t just read a research report, but watches seven customers struggle to find the same button. Where a product manager can query months of accumulated interviews in seconds. Where companies don&amp;#x27;t choose between speed and depth, but get both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The interesting part of the business is actually collecting that proprietary dataset, collecting qualitative research at scale,&amp;quot; Hylton said, describing what she sees as Strella&amp;#x27;s long-term moat. Not replacing the researcher, but making everyone in the company one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

It&amp;#x27;s like being in a Zoom call with an AI instead of a human — it&amp;#x27;s completely free form and voice based.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, the platform also supports human moderators joining the same calls, reflecting the founders&amp;#x27; belief that humans won&amp;#x27;t disappear from the research process. &amp;quot;Human moderation won&amp;#x27;t go away, which is why we&amp;#x27;ve supported human moderation from our Genesis,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;Research tends to be bookended by two very strategic steps: we have a problem, what&amp;#x27;s the research that we should do? And we&amp;#x27;ve done the research, now what are we going to do with it? All the stuff in the middle tends to be execution and lower skill work. We view Strella as doing that middle 90% of the work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why customers tell AI moderators the truth they won&amp;#x27;t share with humans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Strella&amp;#x27;s most surprising findings challenges assumptions about AI in qualitative research: participants appear more honest with AI moderators than with humans. The founders discovered this pattern repeatedly as customers ran head-to-head comparisons between traditional human-moderated studies and Strella&amp;#x27;s AI approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a designer and you get on a Zoom call with a customer and you say, &amp;#x27;Do you like my design?&amp;#x27; they&amp;#x27;re always gonna say yes. They don&amp;#x27;t want to hurt your feelings,&amp;quot; Hylton explained. &amp;quot;But it&amp;#x27;s not a problem at all for Strella. They would tell you exactly what they think about it, which is really valuable. It&amp;#x27;s very hard to get honest feedback.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnan, Strella&amp;#x27;s COO, said companies initially worried about using AI and &amp;quot;eroding quality,&amp;quot; but the platform has &amp;quot;actually found the opposite to be true. People are much more open and honest with an AI moderator, and so the level of insight that you get is much richer because people are giving their unfiltered feedback.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic has practical business implications. Brian Santiago, Senior Product Design Manager at Apollo GraphQL, said in a statement: &amp;quot;Before Strella, studies took weeks. Now we get insights in a day — sometimes in just a few hours. And because participants open up more with the AI moderator, the feedback is deeper and more honest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also addresses endemic fraud in online surveys, particularly when participants are compensated. Because Strella interviews happen on camera in real time, the AI moderator can detect when someone pauses suspiciously long — perhaps to consult ChatGPT — and flags them as potentially fraudulent. &amp;quot;We are fraud resistant,&amp;quot; Hylton said, contrasting this with traditional surveys where fraud rates can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solving mobile app research with persistent screen sharing technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major focus of the Series A funding will be expanding &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strella-mobile-interview/id6746277771"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strella&amp;#x27;s recently-launched mobile application&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Krishnan identified as critical competitive differentiation. The mobile app enables persistent screen sharing during interviews — allowing researchers to watch users navigate mobile applications in real time while the AI moderator asks about their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are the only player in the market that supports screen sharing on mobile,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;You know, I want to understand what are the pain points with my app? Why do people not seem to be able to find the checkout flow? Well, in order to do that effectively, you&amp;#x27;d like to see the user screen while they&amp;#x27;re doing an interview.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumer-facing companies where mobile represents the primary customer interface, this capability opens entirely new use cases. The founders noted that &amp;quot;several of our customers didn&amp;#x27;t do research before&amp;quot; but have now built research practices around Strella because the platform finally made mobile research accessible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also supports embedding traditional survey question types directly into the conversational interview, approaching what Hylton called &amp;quot;feature parity with a survey&amp;quot; while maintaining the engagement advantages of a natural conversation. Strella interviews regularly run 60 to 90 minutes with nearly 100% completion rates—a duration that would see 60-70% drop-off in a traditional survey format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Strella differentiated in a market crowded with AI research startups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strella enters a market that appears crowded at first glance, with established players like &lt;a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a wave of AI-powered startups promising to transform customer research. The founders themselves initially pursued a different approach — synthetic respondents, or &amp;quot;digital twins&amp;quot; that simulate customer perspectives using large language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We actually pivoted from that. That was our initial idea,&amp;quot; Hylton revealed, referring to synthetic respondents. &amp;quot;People are very intrigued by that concept, but found in practice, no willingness to pay right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggesting companies &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/this-new-ai-technique-creates-digital-twin-consumers-and-it-could-kill-the"&gt;&lt;u&gt;could use language models as digital twins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for customer feedback has reignited interest in that approach. But Hylton remains skeptical: &amp;quot;The capabilities of the LLMs as they are today are not good enough, in my opinion, to justify a standalone company. Right now you could just ask ChatGPT, &amp;#x27;What would new users of Duolingo think about this ad copy?&amp;#x27; You can do that. Adding the standalone idea of a synthetic panel is sort of just putting a wrapper on that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Strella&amp;#x27;s bet is that the real value lies in collecting proprietary qualitative data at scale — building what could become &amp;quot;the system of truth for all qualitative insights&amp;quot; within enterprises, as Lindsey Li, Vice President at Bessemer Venture Partners, described it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li, who led the investment just one year after Strella emerged from stealth, said the firm was convinced by both the technology and the team. &amp;quot;Strella has built highly differentiated technology that enables a continuous interview rather than a survey,&amp;quot; Li said. &amp;quot;We heard time and time again that customers loved this product experience relative to other offerings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the defensibility question that concerns many AI investors, Li emphasized product execution over patents: &amp;quot;We think the long game here will be won with a million small product decisions, all of which must be driven by deep empathy for customer pain and an understanding of how best to address their needs. Lydia and Priya exhibit that in spades.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders point to technical depth that&amp;#x27;s difficult to replicate. Most competitors started with adaptive surveys — text-based interfaces where users type responses and wait for the next question. Some have added voice, but typically as uploaded audio clips rather than free-flowing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our approach is fundamentally better, which is the fact that it is a free form conversation,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;You never have to control anything. You&amp;#x27;re never typing, there&amp;#x27;s no buttons, there&amp;#x27;s no upload and wait for the next question. It&amp;#x27;s completely free form, and that has been an extraordinarily hard product to build. There&amp;#x27;s a tremendous amount of IP in the way that we prompt our moderator, the way that we run analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also improves with use, learning from each customer&amp;#x27;s research patterns to fine-tune future interview guides and questions. &amp;quot;Our product gets better for our customers as they continue to use us,&amp;quot; Hylton said. All research accumulates in a central repository where teams can generate new insights by chatting with the data or creating visualizations from previously unstructured qualitative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating new research budgets instead of just automating existing ones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more important than displacing existing research is expanding the total market. Krishnan said growth has been &amp;quot;fundamentally related to our product&amp;quot; creating new research that wouldn&amp;#x27;t have happened otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have expanded the use cases in which people would conduct research,&amp;quot; Krishnan explained. &amp;quot;Several of our customers didn&amp;#x27;t do research before, have always wanted to do research, but didn&amp;#x27;t have a dedicated researcher or team at their company that was devoted to it, and have purchased Strella to kick off and enable their research practice. That&amp;#x27;s been really cool where we&amp;#x27;ve seen this market just opening up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expansion comes as enterprises face mounting pressure to improve customer experience amid declining satisfaction scores. According to &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-2024-us-customer-experience-index/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forrester Research&amp;#x27;s 2024 Customer Experience Index&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, customer experience quality has declined for three consecutive years — an unprecedented trend. The report found that 39% of brands saw CX quality deteriorate, with declines across effectiveness, ease, and emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&amp;#x27;s 2025 Technology, Media &amp;amp; Telecommunications Predictions report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forecasts that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents by 2025, growing to 50% by 2027. The report specifically highlighted AI&amp;#x27;s potential to enhance customer satisfaction by 15-20% while reducing cost to serve by 20-30% when properly implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-08-30-gartner-reveals-three-technologies-that-will-transform-customer-service-and-support-by-2028"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gartner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identified conversational user interfaces — the category Strella inhabits — as one of three technologies poised to transform customer service by 2028, noting that &amp;quot;customers increasingly expect to be able to interact with the applications they use in a natural way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Li sees substantial room for growth. &amp;quot;UX Research is a sub-sector of the $140B+ global market-research industry,&amp;quot; Li said. &amp;quot;This includes both the software layer historically (~$430M) and professional services spend on UX research, design, product strategy, etc. which is conservatively estimated to be ~$6.4B+ annually. As software in this vertical, led by Strella, becomes more powerful, we believe the TAM will continue to expand meaningfully.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making customer feedback accessible across the enterprise, not just research teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders describe their mission as &amp;quot;democratizing access to the customer&amp;quot; — making it possible for anyone in an organization to understand customer perspectives without waiting for dedicated research teams to complete months-long studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many, many, many positions in the organization would like to get customer feedback, but it&amp;#x27;s so hard right now,&amp;quot; Hylton said. With Strella, she explained, someone can &amp;quot;log into Strella and through a chat, create any highlight reel that you want and actually see customers in their own words answering the question that you have based on the research that&amp;#x27;s already been done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This video-first approach to research repositories changes organizational dynamics around customer feedback. &amp;quot;Then you can say, &amp;#x27;Okay, engineering team, we need to build this feature. And here&amp;#x27;s the customer actually saying it,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; Hylton continued. &amp;quot;&amp;#x27;This is not me. This isn&amp;#x27;t politics. Here are seven customers saying they can&amp;#x27;t find the Checkout button.&amp;#x27; The fact that we are a very video-based platform really allows us to do that quickly and painlessly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has moved decisively upmarket, with contract values now typically in the five-figure range and &amp;quot;several six figure contracts&amp;quot; signed, according to Krishnan. The pricing strategy reflects a premium positioning: &amp;quot;Our product is very good, it&amp;#x27;s very premium. We&amp;#x27;re charging based on the value it provides to customers,&amp;quot; Krishnan said, rather than competing on cost alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach appears to be working. The company reports 100% conversion from pilot programs to paid contracts and zero churn among its 40-45 customers, with month-over-month revenue growth of 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The roadmap: Computer vision, agentic AI, and human-machine collaboration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Series A funding will primarily support scaling product and go-to-market teams. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re really confident that we have product-market fit,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;And now the question is execution, and we want to hire a lot of really talented people to help us execute.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the product roadmap, Hylton emphasized continued focus on the participant experience as the key to winning the market. &amp;quot;Everything else is downstream of a joyful participant experience,&amp;quot; she said, including &amp;quot;the quality of insights, the amount you have to pay people to do the interviews, and the way that your customers feel about a company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near-term priorities include adding visual capabilities so the AI moderator can respond to facial expressions and other nonverbal cues, and building more sophisticated collaboration features between human researchers and AI moderators. &amp;quot;Maybe you want to listen while an AI moderator is running a call and you might want to be able to jump in with specific questions,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;Or you want to run an interview yourself, but you want the moderator to be there as backup or to help you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features move toward what the industry calls &amp;quot;agentic AI&amp;quot; — systems that can act more autonomously while still collaborating with humans. The founders see this human-AI collaboration, rather than full automation, as the sustainable path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We believe that a lot of the really strategic work that companies do will continue to be human moderated,&amp;quot; Hylton said. &amp;quot;And you can still do that through Strella and just use us for synthesis in those cases.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Li and Bessemer, the bet is on founders who understand this nuance. &amp;quot;Lydia and Priya exhibit the exact archetype of founders we are excited to partner with for the long term — customer-obsessed, transparent, thoughtful, and singularly driven towards the home-run scenario,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to disclose specific revenue figures or valuation. With the new funding, Strella has now raised $18 million total, including a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/strella-raises-4-million-to-automate-market-research-with-ai-powered-customer-interviews"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$4 million seed round led by Decibel Partners announced in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Strella scales, the founders remain focused on a vision where technology enhances rather than eliminates human judgment—where an engineering team doesn&amp;#x27;t just read a research report, but watches seven customers struggle to find the same button. Where a product manager can query months of accumulated interviews in seconds. Where companies don&amp;#x27;t choose between speed and depth, but get both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The interesting part of the business is actually collecting that proprietary dataset, collecting qualitative research at scale,&amp;quot; Hylton said, describing what she sees as Strella&amp;#x27;s long-term moat. Not replacing the researcher, but making everyone in the company one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Called General Intuition, the startup is betting that Medal’s dataset — which consists of 2 billion videos per year from 10 million monthly active users across tens of thousands of games — surpasses alternatives like Twitch or YouTube for training agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you play video games, you essentially transfer your perception, usually through a first-person view of the camera, to different environments,” Pim de Witte, CEO of Medal and General Intuition, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp; He noted that gamers who upload clips tend to post very negative or positive examples, which serve as really useful edge cases for training. “You get this selection bias towards precisely the kind of data you actually want to use for training work.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This data moat is what reportedly attracted the attention of OpenAI, which late last year attempted to acquire Medal for $500 million, per The Information. (Neither OpenAI nor General Intuition would comment on the report.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also what has led to General Intuition’s raising a whopping $133.7 million in seed funding, led by Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst with participation from Raine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3058188" height="556" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/general_intuition_announcement_hero.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;General Intuition’s founding team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;General Intuition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup intends to use the funds to grow its team of researchers and engineers focused on training a general agent that can interact with the world around it, aiming for initial applications in gaming, and search-and-rescue drones.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;De Witte says the founding team has already made strides: General Intuition’s model can understand environments it wasn’t trained on and correctly predict actions within them. It’s able to do this purely through visual input; agents only see what a human player would see, and they move through space by following controller inputs. This approach, the company says, can transfer naturally to physical systems like robotic arms, drones, and autonomous vehicles, which are often manipulated by humans using video game controllers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Intuition’s next milestone is twofold: generating new simulated worlds for training other agents and autonomously navigating entirely unfamiliar physical environments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That technical approach is shaping how the company plans to commercialize its technology and sets it apart from competitors building world models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While General Intuition is also building world models on which to train its agents, such&amp;nbsp;models aren’t the product. Unlike other world model makers like DeepMind and World Labs, which are selling their world models Genie and Marble, respectively, for training agents and content creation, General Intuition is focusing on other use cases to avoid copyright issues.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is not to produce models that compete with game developers,” de Witte said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead, the startup’s gaming applications center around creating bots and non-player characters that can surpass traditional “deterministic bots,” or preprogrammed characters that produce the same output every time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[The bots] can scale to any level of difficulty,” Moritz Baier-Lentz, a founding member of General Intuition and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, told TechCrunch. “It’s not compelling to create a god bot that beats everyone, but if you can scale gradually and fill in liquidity for any player situation so that their win rate is always around 50%, that will maximize their engagement and retention.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;De Witte also has a background in humanitarian work, which informs the startup’s focus on powering search-and-rescue drones, which sometimes have to navigate unfamiliar environments and extract information without GPS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ultimately, de Witte and Baier-Lentz see General Intuition’s core functionality — spatial-temporal reasoning — as a crucial piece in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While major AI labs focus on building ever more powerful large language models, General Intuition believes true AGI requires something LLMs fundamentally lack.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As humans, we create text to describe what’s going on in our world, but in doing so, you lose a lot of information,” de Witte said. “You lose general intuition around spatial-temporal reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Medal, a platform for uploading and sharing video game clips, has spun out a new frontier AI research lab that’s using its trove of gaming videos to train and build foundation models and AI agents that can understand how objects and entities move through space and time — a concept known as spatial-temporal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can now personalize their feeds to restrict generative AI imagery in select categories, and the company said it will make its existing GenAI content labels more noticeable in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The site, widely used to browse and bookmark inspirational content and potential purchases, has come under fire from users who have complained about the massive uptick in GenAI content. The media has also been documenting the problem, while openly&amp;nbsp;wondering if AI has already ruined&amp;nbsp;Pinterest or if it could still be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem, if left unresolved, could destroy Pinterest’s reputation and, ultimately, its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI slop is potentially a tough nut to crack as more of the web fills up with AI-generated content and the quality of the AI content improves, making it less obvious to spot. Citing academic literature, Pinterest notes that GenAI content now makes up 57% of all online material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address the issue, Pinterest earlier this year introduced “AI modified” labels that would appear on images whose metadata indicated AI generation, or if Pinterest’s own systems detected that the content was AI-generated. At the time, the company said it would “soon” introduce consumer-facing tools that would let users choose to see less AI content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3058211" height="452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FilteringPins-UIDemo.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those tools have now arrived and will be available in the app’s “Settings” menu, under “Refine your recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here, users will be able to configure whether they’d like to see less GenAI content in certain categories that are prone to AI-generated imagery, like beauty, art, fashion, and home décor. Pinterest said it will introduce more categories in the future, based on user feedback. Plus, if users want to modify their settings, they can do so at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, users can send feedback about AI imagery as they browse the site. If they see a Pin that’s not appealing because of its generative AI nature, they can tap the three-dot overflow menu and select a category to refine their preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new controls are launching first on the website and Android and will roll out to iOS users over the weeks ahead, Pinterest said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our community is at the heart of everything we do,” said Matt Madrigal, Pinterest’s chief technology officer, in a statement about the launch. “With our new GenAI controls, we’re empowering people to personalize their Pinterest experience more than ever — striking the right balance between human creativity and AI innovation, and ensuring every feed truly reflects what inspires them most.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Following backlash over an increase in “AI slop” taking over users’ feeds, Pinterest on Thursday added new tools that let users limit how much AI-generated content they see on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can now personalize their feeds to restrict generative AI imagery in select categories, and the company said it will make its existing GenAI content labels more noticeable in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The site, widely used to browse and bookmark inspirational content and potential purchases, has come under fire from users who have complained about the massive uptick in GenAI content. The media has also been documenting the problem, while openly&amp;nbsp;wondering if AI has already ruined&amp;nbsp;Pinterest or if it could still be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem, if left unresolved, could destroy Pinterest’s reputation and, ultimately, its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI slop is potentially a tough nut to crack as more of the web fills up with AI-generated content and the quality of the AI content improves, making it less obvious to spot. Citing academic literature, Pinterest notes that GenAI content now makes up 57% of all online material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address the issue, Pinterest earlier this year introduced “AI modified” labels that would appear on images whose metadata indicated AI generation, or if Pinterest’s own systems detected that the content was AI-generated. At the time, the company said it would “soon” introduce consumer-facing tools that would let users choose to see less AI content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3058211" height="452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FilteringPins-UIDemo.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those tools have now arrived and will be available in the app’s “Settings” menu, under “Refine your recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

A growing number of bacterial infections aren’t responding to these medicines—including common ones that affect the blood, gut, and urinary tract. Get infected with one of these bugs, and there’s a fair chance antibiotics won’t help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The scary truth is that a growing number of harmful bacteria and fungi are becoming resistant to drugs. Just a few weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report finding a sharp rise in infections caused by a dangerous type of bacteria that are resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics. Now, the WHO report shows that the problem is surging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this week’s Checkup, we’re trying something a bit different—a little quiz. You’ve probably heard about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) before, but how much do you know about microbes, antibiotics, and the scale of the problem?

A growing number of bacterial infections aren’t responding to these medicines—including common ones that affect the blood, gut, and urinary tract. Get infected with one of these bugs, and there’s a fair chance antibiotics won’t help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The scary truth is that a growing number of harmful bacteria and fungi are becoming resistant to drugs. Just a few weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report finding a sharp rise in infections caused by a dangerous type of bacteria that are resistant to some of the strongest antibiotics. Now, the WHO report shows that the problem is surging around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this week’s Checkup, we’re trying something a bit different—a little quiz. You’ve probably heard about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) before, but how much do you know about microbes, antibiotics, and the scale of the problem?

When a company sells a product in the United States that harms someone, that person can generally sue that company for damages under the doctrine of product liability. Those suits force companies to internalize the harms their products create—and incentivize them to make their products safer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courts haven’t settled on whether AI systems are products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Early cases indicate that US courts are open to treating AI systems as products for the purposes of product liability. In a case against CharacterAI, a federal judge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/important-early-ruling-in-characterai-case-this-chatbot-is-a-product-not-speech" rel="rel"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the company’s system did count as a product. OpenAI is facing a similar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Raine-v-OpenAI-Complaint-8-26-25.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;suit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; brought in California state court. Nonetheless, the lack of legal certainty might deter potential plaintiffs from bringing suits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI LEAD Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; would apply product liability to AI systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI LEAD Act &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;would clarify that AI systems are subject to product liability and establish a path for claims to be brought in federal court. In general, the act would hold AI companies liable for harms caused by their AI systems if the company:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed to exercise reasonable care in designing the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed to exercise reasonable care in providing instructions or warnings for the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaches a warranty it provided for the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold or distributed an AI system in a defective condition that permitted unreasonably dangerous misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployers of an AI system are also liable for harm if they substantially modify or dangerously misuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The act also prohibits AI companies from limiting their liability though contracts with consumers, requires that foreign AI developers register agents for service of process with the US before placing their products on the US market, and permits states to establish stronger safety legislation if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China’s Ministry of Commerce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_7fc9bff0fb4546ecb02f66ee77d0e5f6.html" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; new export controls on rare earth metals, set to take effect December 1. If aggressively enforced, the rules would give China control over a key part of the global AI and defense supply chains. It also unveiled curbs on the export of equipment used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries, effective November 8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China dominates global production of rare earths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China has a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html" rel="rel"&gt;virtual monopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on the production of rare earth metals, which are vital to semiconductors, smartphones, AI systems, wind turbines, electric motors, and military hardware. According to the new rules, companies exporting products containing Chinese rare earths are required to obtain export licenses from China’s Ministry of Commerce. Exporting Chinese rare earths for military use is prohibited, and use in developing sub-14 nanometer chips will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IY3v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F579c41b1-9f1d-4f29-ab53-3c451e5e6e58_980x653.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="653" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IY3v!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F579c41b1-9f1d-4f29-ab53-3c451e5e6e58_980x653.png" width="980" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Chinese rare earth mine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-earths-exports-trump-dad99d532f858f04d750d0b8c50e5ed6" rel="rel"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If aggressively enforced, the new rules would likely disrupt AI supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Rare earth metals are critical to companies producing AI hardware, and their restriction would cause downstream impacts to AI developers. Some analysts predicted they could even trigger a wider economic downturn. “If enforced aggressively,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1976260051351343195" rel="rel"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dean Ball on X, “this policy could mean ‘lights out’ for the US AI boom, and likely lead to a recession/economic crisis in the US in the short term.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China may be using its monopoly as leverage to extract US concessions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;China claims that the purpose of the controls are only to prevent its rare earth metals from being used in military applications—samarium, for example, is used by the U.S. to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions" rel="rel"&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; F-35 fighter jets and missile systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the rules would give China effective control over the supply chains of several critical industries, including AI. The US is unlikely to accept that strategic vulnerability. US President Donald Trump &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115351840469973590" rel="rel"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the new controls by announcing a 100 percent additional tariff on Chinese goods—on top of the existing 30 percent tariffs—as well as export controls on critical software, both going into effect November 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China may walk back its controls to deescalate an economic confrontation with the US, or in exchange for reduced tariffs or greater access to frontier AI chips. In the long run, the US would be well-advised to build independent rare earth metal production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A large group of people in AI—including Dan Hendrycks, Yoshua Bengio, Dawn Song, Max Tegmark, Eric Schmidt, Jaan Tallinn, Gary Marcus, and others—released a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agidefinition.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; introducing a quantifiable framework for defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming to standardize the term and measure the gap between current AI and human-level cognition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGI definitions are often nebulous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The paper argues that the term AGI currently acts as a “constantly moving goalpost.” As specialized AI systems master tasks previously thought to require human intellect, the criteria for AGI shift. This ambiguity hinders productive discussions about progress and obscures the actual distance to human-level intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The framework is grounded in theory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The authors define AGI as “an AI that can match or exceed the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult.” To operationalize this, they ground their methodology in the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory, the most empirically validated model of human intelligence. The framework adapts established human psychometric tests to evaluate AI systems across ten core cognitive domains, resulting in a standardized “AGI Score” (0-100%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current models exhibit a “jagged” cognitive profile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Application of the framework reveals highly uneven capabilities. While models are proficient in knowledge-intensive domains (such as Math or Reading/Writing), they possess critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PDPm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d55bd85-caa6-4252-8cc7-6470a89c5f19_1600x1158.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="1054" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PDPm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d55bd85-caa6-4252-8cc7-6470a89c5f19_1600x1158.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term memory storage is the critical bottleneck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The most significant deficit identified is Long-Term Memory Storage, where current models score near 0%. This results in a form of “amnesia,” forcing the AI to re-learn context in every interaction. The paper notes that the reliance on massive context windows (Working Memory) is a “capability contortion” used to compensate for this lack of persistent memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The framework quantifies the gap to AGI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The resulting scores are intended to concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI. The paper estimates GPT-4 at a 27% AGI score and the anticipated GPT-5 (2025) at 58%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper can be accessed at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agidefinition.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;agidefinition.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/" rel="rel"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

In a case against CharacterAI, a federal judge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/important-early-ruling-in-characterai-case-this-chatbot-is-a-product-not-speech" rel="rel"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the company’s system did count as a product. OpenAI is facing a similar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Raine-v-OpenAI-Complaint-8-26-25.pdf" rel="rel"&gt;suit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; brought in California state court. Nonetheless, the lack of legal certainty might deter potential plaintiffs from bringing suits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI LEAD Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; would apply product liability to AI systems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI LEAD Act &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;would clarify that AI systems are subject to product liability and establish a path for claims to be brought in federal court. In general, the act would hold AI companies liable for harms caused by their AI systems if the company:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed to exercise reasonable care in designing the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed to exercise reasonable care in providing instructions or warnings for the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaches a warranty it provided for the AI system,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold or distributed an AI system in a defective condition that permitted unreasonably dangerous misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployers of an AI system are also liable for harm if they substantially modify or dangerously misuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The act also prohibits AI companies from limiting their liability though contracts with consumers, requires that foreign AI developers register agents for service of process with the US before placing their products on the US market, and permits states to establish stronger safety legislation if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China’s Ministry of Commerce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_7fc9bff0fb4546ecb02f66ee77d0e5f6.html" rel="rel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; new export controls on rare earth metals, set to take effect December 1. If aggressively enforced, the rules would give China control over a key part of the global AI and defense supply chains. It also unveiled curbs on the export of equipment used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries, effective November 8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China dominates global production of rare earths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; China has a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html" rel="rel"&gt;virtual monopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on the production of rare earth metals, which are vital to semiconductors, smartphones, AI systems, wind turbines, electric motors, and military hardware. According to the new rules, companies exporting products containing Chinese rare earths are required to obtain export licenses from China’s Ministry of Commerce. Exporting Chinese rare earths for military use is prohibited, and use in developing sub-14 nanometer chips will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IY3v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F579c41b1-9f1d-4f29-ab53-3c451e5e6e58_980x653.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="653" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IY3v!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F579c41b1-9f1d-4f29-ab53-3c451e5e6e58_980x653.png" width="980" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Chinese rare earth mine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-earths-exports-trump-dad99d532f858f04d750d0b8c50e5ed6" rel="rel"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If aggressively enforced, the new rules would likely disrupt AI supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Rare earth metals are critical to companies producing AI hardware, and their restriction would cause downstream impacts to AI developers. Some analysts predicted they could even trigger a wider economic downturn. “If enforced aggressively,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1976260051351343195" rel="rel"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dean Ball on X, “this policy could mean ‘lights out’ for the US AI boom, and likely lead to a recession/economic crisis in the US in the short term.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China may be using its monopoly as leverage to extract US concessions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;China claims that the purpose of the controls are only to prevent its rare earth metals from being used in military applications—samarium, for example, is used by the U.S. to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions" rel="rel"&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; F-35 fighter jets and missile systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the rules would give China effective control over the supply chains of several critical industries, including AI. The US is unlikely to accept that strategic vulnerability. US President Donald Trump &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115351840469973590" rel="rel"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the new controls by announcing a 100 percent additional tariff on Chinese goods—on top of the existing 30 percent tariffs—as well as export controls on critical software, both going into effect November 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China may walk back its controls to deescalate an economic confrontation with the US, or in exchange for reduced tariffs or greater access to frontier AI chips. In the long run, the US would be well-advised to build independent rare earth metal production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A large group of people in AI—including Dan Hendrycks, Yoshua Bengio, Dawn Song, Max Tegmark, Eric Schmidt, Jaan Tallinn, Gary Marcus, and others—released a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agidefinition.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; introducing a quantifiable framework for defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming to standardize the term and measure the gap between current AI and human-level cognition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGI definitions are often nebulous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The paper argues that the term AGI currently acts as a “constantly moving goalpost.” As specialized AI systems master tasks previously thought to require human intellect, the criteria for AGI shift. This ambiguity hinders productive discussions about progress and obscures the actual distance to human-level intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The framework is grounded in theory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The authors define AGI as “an AI that can match or exceed the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult.” To operationalize this, they ground their methodology in the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory, the most empirically validated model of human intelligence. The framework adapts established human psychometric tests to evaluate AI systems across ten core cognitive domains, resulting in a standardized “AGI Score” (0-100%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current models exhibit a “jagged” cognitive profile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Application of the framework reveals highly uneven capabilities. While models are proficient in knowledge-intensive domains (such as Math or Reading/Writing), they possess critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PDPm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d55bd85-caa6-4252-8cc7-6470a89c5f19_1600x1158.png" rel="rel" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;div class="image2-inset"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="sizing-normal" height="1054" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PDPm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d55bd85-caa6-4252-8cc7-6470a89c5f19_1600x1158.png" width="1456" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term memory storage is the critical bottleneck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The most significant deficit identified is Long-Term Memory Storage, where current models score near 0%. This results in a form of “amnesia,” forcing the AI to re-learn context in every interaction. The paper notes that the reliance on massive context windows (Working Memory) is a “capability contortion” used to compensate for this lack of persistent memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The framework quantifies the gap to AGI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; The resulting scores are intended to concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI. The paper estimates GPT-4 at a 27% AGI score and the anticipated GPT-5 (2025) at 58%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper can be accessed at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agidefinition.ai/" rel="rel"&gt;agidefinition.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/" rel="rel"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

launched a new capability on Thursday that allows its &lt;a href="https://claude.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; assistant to tap into specialized expertise on demand, marking the company&amp;#x27;s latest effort to make artificial intelligence more practical for enterprise workflows as it chases rival OpenAI in the intensifying competition over AI-powered software development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature, called &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enables users to create folders containing instructions, code scripts, and reference materials that Claude can automatically load when relevant to a task. The system marks a fundamental shift in how organizations can customize AI assistants, moving beyond one-off prompts to reusable packages of domain expertise that work consistently across an entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills are based on our belief and vision that as model intelligence continues to improve, we&amp;#x27;ll continue moving towards general-purpose agents that often have access to their own filesystem and computing environment,&amp;quot; said Mahesh Murag, a member of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technical staff, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The agent is initially made aware only of the names and descriptions of each available skill and can choose to load more information about a particular skill when relevant to the task at hand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch comes as Anthropic, valued at &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$183 billion after a recent $13 billion funding round&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, projects its annual revenue could nearly triple to as much as $26 billion in 2026, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company is currently approaching a $7 billion annual revenue run rate, up from $5 billion in August, fueled largely by enterprise adoption of its AI coding tools — a market where it faces fierce competition from OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recently upgraded Codex platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;progressive disclosure&amp;#x27; solves the context window problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; differ fundamentally from existing approaches to customizing AI assistants, such as prompt engineering or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Murag explained. The architecture relies on what Anthropic calls &amp;quot;progressive disclosure&amp;quot; — Claude initially sees only skill names and brief descriptions, then autonomously decides which skills to load based on the task at hand, accessing only the specific files and information needed at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike RAG, this relies on simple tools that let Claude manage and read files from a filesystem,&amp;quot; Murag told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Skills can contain an unbounded amount of context to teach Claude how to complete a task or series of tasks. This is because Skills are based on the premise of an agent being able to autonomously and intelligently navigate a filesystem and execute code.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows organizations to bundle far more information than traditional context windows permit, while maintaining the speed and efficiency that enterprise users demand. A single skill can include step-by-step procedures, code templates, reference documents, brand guidelines, compliance checklists, and executable scripts — all organized in a folder structure that Claude navigates intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system&amp;#x27;s composability provides another technical advantage. Multiple skills automatically stack together when needed for complex workflows. For instance, Claude might simultaneously invoke a company&amp;#x27;s brand guidelines skill, a financial reporting skill, and a presentation formatting skill to generate a quarterly investor deck — coordinating between all three without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes Skills different from OpenAI&amp;#x27;s Custom GPTs and Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Copilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is positioning Skills as distinct from competing offerings like OpenAI&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom GPTs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Copilot Studio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though the features address similar enterprise needs around AI customization and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills&amp;#x27; combination of progressive disclosure, composability, and executable code bundling is unique in the market,&amp;quot; Murag said. &amp;quot;While other platforms require developers to build custom scaffolding, Skills let anyone — technical or not — create specialized agents by organizing procedural knowledge into files.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-platform portability also sets Skills apart. The same skill works identically across &lt;a href="http://claude.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Code&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Anthropic&amp;#x27;s AI coding environment), the company&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/platform/api"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Agent SDK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for building custom AI agents. Organizations can develop a skill once and deploy it everywhere their teams use Claude, a significant advantage for enterprises seeking consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature supports any programming language compatible with the underlying container environment, and Anthropic provides sandboxing for security — though the company acknowledges that allowing AI to execute code requires users to carefully vet which skills they trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early customers report 8x productivity gains on finance workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early customer implementations reveal how organizations are applying &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to automate complex knowledge work. At Japanese e-commerce giant &lt;a href="https://www.rakuten.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rakuten&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the AI team is using Skills to transform finance operations that previously required manual coordination across multiple departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills streamline our management accounting and finance workflows,&amp;quot; said Yusuke Kaji, general manager of AI at Rakuten in a statement. &amp;quot;Claude processes multiple spreadsheets, catches critical anomalies, and generates reports using our procedures. What once took a day, we can now accomplish in an hour.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x27;s an 8x improvement in productivity for specific workflows — the kind of measurable return on investment that enterprises increasingly demand from AI implementations. Mike Krieger, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s chief product officer and Instagram co-founder, recently noted that companies have moved past &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-cpo-companies-success-metrics-avoid-ai-fomo-2025-10"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI FOMO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; to requiring concrete success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design platform &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canva&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plans to integrate Skills into its own AI agent workflows. &amp;quot;Canva plans to leverage Skills to customize agents and expand what they can do,&amp;quot; said Anwar Haneef, general manager and head of ecosystem at Canva in a statement. &amp;quot;This unlocks new ways to bring Canva deeper into agentic workflows—helping teams capture their unique context and create stunning, high-quality designs effortlessly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud storage provider &lt;a href="https://www.box.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Box&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sees Skills as a way to make corporate content repositories more actionable. &amp;quot;Skills teaches Claude how to work with Box content,&amp;quot; said Yashodha Bhavnani, head of AI at Box. &amp;quot;Users can transform stored files into PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and Word documents that follow their organization&amp;#x27;s standards—saving hours of effort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The enterprise security question: Who controls which AI skills employees can use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise IT departments, &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; raise important questions about governance and control—particularly since the feature allows AI to execute arbitrary code in sandboxed environments. Anthropic has built administrative controls that allow enterprise customers to manage access at the organizational level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enterprise admins control access to the Skills capability via admin settings, where they can enable or disable access and monitor usage patterns,&amp;quot; Murag said. &amp;quot;Once enabled at the organizational level, individual users still need to opt in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That two-layer consent model — organizational enablement plus individual opt-in — reflects lessons learned from previous enterprise AI deployments where blanket rollouts created compliance concerns. However, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s governance tools appear more limited than some enterprise customers might expect. The company doesn&amp;#x27;t currently offer granular controls over which specific skills employees can use, or detailed audit trails of custom skill content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations concerned about data security should note that Skills require Claude&amp;#x27;s code execution environment, which runs in isolated containers. Anthropic advises users to &amp;quot;stick to trusted sources&amp;quot; when installing skills and provides security documentation, but the company acknowledges this is an inherently higher-risk capability than traditional AI interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From API to no-code: How Anthropic is making Skills accessible to everyone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is taking several approaches to make &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accessible to users with varying technical sophistication. For non-technical users on &lt;a href="http://claude.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company provides a &amp;quot;skill-creator&amp;quot; skill that interactively guides users through building new skills by asking questions about their workflow, then automatically generating the folder structure and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers working with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;amp;ai=DChsSEwiggs2qraiQAxVWBa0GHdB6FzYYACICCAEQABoCcHY&amp;amp;ae=2&amp;amp;co=1&amp;amp;ase=2&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwr8LHBhBKEiwAy47uUvG3v5zXtZxMzYnFijKFAiDeYFa6OmWUAE1klOZDZ1ZjEL_wOnBjShoC9osQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;cid=CAASugHkaOdviUSYAhp033BnqKi_m1QUy4d_9UnHirVmZCJZSnrd1p-IH-JSwD7zHfKxN59LdDV3IiubJ9mStf_q5CSgrktsrI1deP4WXcf01uLZ1Z98vFRa-3nrliSupihKZ_9iT5Fce10TuciASCCUBAZwEf-wFTA8DNSuVCBEO3EiPAj-Wyo-9vFJk8uCLp_r8yi8DRP4fG0xKwlJwUzWtYpk2oD5f2zmd3ijjkWwZcEty0swPcvf09eh90Q&amp;amp;cce=2&amp;amp;category=acrcp_v1_71&amp;amp;sig=AOD64_06_nK0XQVMjJCrrzehYQwSZRJExA&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;nis=4&amp;amp;adurl&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiD-8SqraiQAxXHyOYEHf8JB1wQ0Qx6BAgeEAE"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; get programmatic control through a new /skills endpoint and can manage skill versions through the Claude Console web interface. The feature requires enabling the Code Execution Tool beta in API requests. For Claude Code users, skills can be installed via plugins from the anthropics/skills GitHub marketplace, and teams can share skills through version control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills are included in Max, Pro, Teams, and Enterprise plans at no additional cost,&amp;quot; Murag confirmed. &amp;quot;API usage follows standard API pricing,&amp;quot; meaning organizations pay only for the tokens consumed during skill execution, not for the skills themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic provides several pre-built skills for common business tasks, including professional generation of Excel spreadsheets with formulas, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and fillable PDFs. These Anthropic-created skills will remain free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the Skills launch matters in the AI coding wars with OpenAI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Skills announcement arrives during a pivotal moment in Anthropic&amp;#x27;s competition with OpenAI, particularly around AI-assisted software development. Just one day before releasing Skills, Anthropic launched &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-is-giving-away-its-powerful-claude-haiku-4-5-ai-for-free-to-take"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Haiku 4.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller and cheaper model that nonetheless matches the coding performance of &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Sonnet 4&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which was state-of-the-art when released just five months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rapid improvement curve reflects the breakneck pace of AI development, where today&amp;#x27;s frontier capabilities become tomorrow&amp;#x27;s commodity offerings. OpenAI has been pushing hard on coding tools as well, recently upgrading its &lt;a href="https://openai.com/codex/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Codex platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPT-5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and expanding &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub Copilot&amp;#x27;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s revenue trajectory — potentially reaching &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$26 billion in 2026&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from an estimated $9 billion by year-end 2025 — suggests the company is successfully converting enterprise interest into paying customers. The timing also follows Salesforce&amp;#x27;s announcement this week that it&amp;#x27;s deepening AI partnerships with both OpenAI and Anthropic to power its Agentforce platform, signaling that enterprises are adopting a multi-vendor approach rather than standardizing on a single provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills addresses a real pain point: the &amp;quot;prompt engineering&amp;quot; problem where effective AI usage depends on individual employees crafting elaborate instructions for routine tasks, with no way to share that expertise across teams. Skills transforms implicit knowledge into explicit, shareable assets. For startups and developers, the feature could accelerate product development significantly — adding sophisticated document generation capabilities that previously required dedicated engineering teams and weeks of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The composability aspect hints at a future where organizations build libraries of specialized skills that can be mixed and matched for increasingly complex workflows. A pharmaceutical company might develop skills for regulatory compliance, clinical trial analysis, molecular modeling, and patient data privacy that work together seamlessly — creating a customized AI assistant with deep domain expertise across multiple specialties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic indicates it&amp;#x27;s working on simplified skill creation workflows and enterprise-wide deployment capabilities to make it easier for organizations to distribute skills across large teams. As the feature rolls out to Anthropic&amp;#x27;s more than 300,000 business customers, the true test will be whether organizations find Skills substantively more useful than existing customization approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Skills offers Anthropic&amp;#x27;s clearest articulation yet of its vision for AI agents: not generalists that try to do everything reasonably well, but intelligent systems that know when to access specialized expertise and can coordinate multiple domains of knowledge to accomplish complex tasks. If that vision catches on, the question won&amp;#x27;t be whether your company uses AI — it will be whether your AI knows how your company actually works.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropic.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched a new capability on Thursday that allows its &lt;a href="https://claude.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; assistant to tap into specialized expertise on demand, marking the company&amp;#x27;s latest effort to make artificial intelligence more practical for enterprise workflows as it chases rival OpenAI in the intensifying competition over AI-powered software development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature, called &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enables users to create folders containing instructions, code scripts, and reference materials that Claude can automatically load when relevant to a task. The system marks a fundamental shift in how organizations can customize AI assistants, moving beyond one-off prompts to reusable packages of domain expertise that work consistently across an entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills are based on our belief and vision that as model intelligence continues to improve, we&amp;#x27;ll continue moving towards general-purpose agents that often have access to their own filesystem and computing environment,&amp;quot; said Mahesh Murag, a member of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technical staff, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The agent is initially made aware only of the names and descriptions of each available skill and can choose to load more information about a particular skill when relevant to the task at hand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch comes as Anthropic, valued at &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$183 billion after a recent $13 billion funding round&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, projects its annual revenue could nearly triple to as much as $26 billion in 2026, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company is currently approaching a $7 billion annual revenue run rate, up from $5 billion in August, fueled largely by enterprise adoption of its AI coding tools — a market where it faces fierce competition from OpenAI&amp;#x27;s recently upgraded Codex platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;progressive disclosure&amp;#x27; solves the context window problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; differ fundamentally from existing approaches to customizing AI assistants, such as prompt engineering or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Murag explained. The architecture relies on what Anthropic calls &amp;quot;progressive disclosure&amp;quot; — Claude initially sees only skill names and brief descriptions, then autonomously decides which skills to load based on the task at hand, accessing only the specific files and information needed at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike RAG, this relies on simple tools that let Claude manage and read files from a filesystem,&amp;quot; Murag told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Skills can contain an unbounded amount of context to teach Claude how to complete a task or series of tasks. This is because Skills are based on the premise of an agent being able to autonomously and intelligently navigate a filesystem and execute code.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows organizations to bundle far more information than traditional context windows permit, while maintaining the speed and efficiency that enterprise users demand. A single skill can include step-by-step procedures, code templates, reference documents, brand guidelines, compliance checklists, and executable scripts — all organized in a folder structure that Claude navigates intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system&amp;#x27;s composability provides another technical advantage. Multiple skills automatically stack together when needed for complex workflows. For instance, Claude might simultaneously invoke a company&amp;#x27;s brand guidelines skill, a financial reporting skill, and a presentation formatting skill to generate a quarterly investor deck — coordinating between all three without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes Skills different from OpenAI&amp;#x27;s Custom GPTs and Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Copilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is positioning Skills as distinct from competing offerings like OpenAI&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom GPTs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Copilot Studio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though the features address similar enterprise needs around AI customization and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills&amp;#x27; combination of progressive disclosure, composability, and executable code bundling is unique in the market,&amp;quot; Murag said. &amp;quot;While other platforms require developers to build custom scaffolding, Skills let anyone — technical or not — create specialized agents by organizing procedural knowledge into files.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-platform portability also sets Skills apart. The same skill works identically across &lt;a href="http://claude.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Code&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Anthropic&amp;#x27;s AI coding environment), the company&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.claude.com/platform/api"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Agent SDK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for building custom AI agents. Organizations can develop a skill once and deploy it everywhere their teams use Claude, a significant advantage for enterprises seeking consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature supports any programming language compatible with the underlying container environment, and Anthropic provides sandboxing for security — though the company acknowledges that allowing AI to execute code requires users to carefully vet which skills they trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early customers report 8x productivity gains on finance workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early customer implementations reveal how organizations are applying &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to automate complex knowledge work. At Japanese e-commerce giant &lt;a href="https://www.rakuten.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rakuten&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the AI team is using Skills to transform finance operations that previously required manual coordination across multiple departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skills streamline our management accounting and finance workflows,&amp;quot; said Yusuke Kaji, general manager of AI at Rakuten in a statement. &amp;quot;Claude processes multiple spreadsheets, catches critical anomalies, and generates reports using our procedures. What once took a day, we can now accomplish in an hour.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x27;s an 8x improvement in productivity for specific workflows — the kind of measurable return on investment that enterprises increasingly demand from AI implementations. Mike Krieger, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s chief product officer and Instagram co-founder, recently noted that companies have moved past &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-cpo-companies-success-metrics-avoid-ai-fomo-2025-10"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI FOMO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; to requiring concrete success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design platform &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canva&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plans to integrate Skills into its own AI agent workflows. &amp;quot;Canva plans to leverage Skills to customize agents and expand what they can do,&amp;quot; said Anwar Haneef, general manager and head of ecosystem at Canva in a statement. &amp;quot;This unlocks new ways to bring Canva deeper into agentic workflows—helping teams capture their unique context and create stunning, high-quality designs effortlessly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud storage provider &lt;a href="https://www.box.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Box&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sees Skills as a way to make corporate content repositories more actionable. &amp;quot;Skills teaches Claude how to work with Box content,&amp;quot; said Yashodha Bhavnani, head of AI at Box. &amp;quot;Users can transform stored files into PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and Word documents that follow their organization&amp;#x27;s standards—saving hours of effort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The enterprise security question: Who controls which AI skills employees can use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise IT departments, &lt;a href="http://anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; raise important questions about governance and control—particularly since the feature allows AI to execute arbitrary code in sandboxed environments. Anthropic has built administrative controls that allow enterprise customers to manage access at the organizational level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enterprise admins control access to the Skills capability via admin settings, where they can enable or disable access and monitor usage patterns,&amp;quot; Murag said. &amp;quot;Once enabled at the organizational level, individual users still need to opt in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That two-layer consent model — organizational enablement plus individual opt-in — reflects lessons learned from previous enterprise AI deployments where blanket rollouts created compliance concerns. However, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s governance tools appear more limited than some enterprise customers might expect. The company doesn&amp;#x27;t currently offer granular controls over which specific skills employees can use, or detailed audit trails of custom skill content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations concerned about data security should note that Skills require Claude&amp;#x27;s code execution environment, which runs in isolated containers.

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, OpenAI has faced backlash over subpoenas it sent to nonprofits accused of conspiring with Elon Musk to amplify public criticism of OpenAI as it sought to shift from a nonprofit to for-profit structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas are supposed to support OpenAI's defense in a lawsuit Musk's X Corp filed to block the for-profit transition. Seeking a "wide variety of documents"—including a sweeping request for all communications regarding Musk and all information on nonprofits' funders and donations—OpenAI claimed that the subpoenas are intended to probe if Musk was involved in the actions or paid nonprofits to make critical comments, NBC News wrote in a report exhaustively documenting the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nonprofits have alleged it's obvious that OpenAI is using the lawsuit to harass, silence, and intimidate its critics—most glaringly when it comes to targeting nonprofits that are even more publicly critical of Musk's companies than they are of OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Ruby-Sachs, executive director for Ekō—a nonprofit that serves as a global consumer watchdog holding the "biggest companies in the world accountable"—told NBC News that "the logical basis" for sending the subpoena "is so ridiculous that we have to assume this is just a tactic to scare us and get us to back off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby-Sachs noted that Ekō called for Musk to be fired as the head of DOGE earlier this year. Running a billboard in Times Square that showed a grinning Musk donning a crown, Ekō urged passersby to contact Congress if they "don't want a king."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Ekō had corresponded with OpenAI prior to receiving the subpoena, confirming that "we’re over 70 percent funded by small online donations from individuals, and we’ve run multiple campaigns against Elon Musk in the last year," Ruby-Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are not in any way supported by or funded by Elon Musk and have a history of campaigning against him and his interests," Ruby-Sachs told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nonprofit watchdog targeted by OpenAI was The Midas Project, which strives to make sure AI benefits everyone. Notably, Musk's lawsuit accused OpenAI of abandoning its mission to benefit humanity in pursuit of immense profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the founder of The Midas Project, Tyler Johnston, was shocked to see his group portrayed as coordinating with Musk. He posted on X to clarify that Musk had nothing to do with the group's "OpenAI Files," which comprehensively document areas of concern with any plan to shift away from nonprofit governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His post came after OpenAI's chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, wrote that "several organizations, some of them suddenly newly formed like the Midas Project, joined in and ran campaigns" backing Musk's "opposition to OpenAI's restructure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What are you talking about?" Johnston wrote. "We were formed 19 months ago. We've never spoken with or taken funding from Musk and [his] ilk, which we would have been happy to tell you if you asked a single time. In fact, we've said he runs xAI so horridly it makes OpenAI 'saintly in comparison.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI acting like a “cutthroat” corporation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston complained that OpenAI's subpoena had already hurt the Midas Project, as insurers had denied coverage based on news coverage. He accused OpenAI of not just trying to silence critics but possibly shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you wanted to constrain an org’s speech, intimidation would be one strategy, but making them uninsurable is another, and maybe that’s what’s happened to us with this subpoena," Johnston suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other nonprofits, like the San Francisco Foundation (SFF) and Encode, accused OpenAI of using subpoenas to potentially block or slow down legal interventions. Judith Bell, SFF's chief impact officer, told NBC News that her nonprofit's subpoena came after spearheading a petition to California’s attorney general to block OpenAI's restructuring. And Encode's general counsel, Nathan Calvin, was subpoenaed after sponsoring a California safety regulation meant to make it easier to monitor risks of frontier AI.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the targeted groups, Encode filed an amicus brief supporting Musk in the OpenAI lawsuit, with Calvin arguing that "OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in order to protect" their commitment to building AI that benefits the public, "and the public interest requires they keep their word."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On X, Kwon said Encode had inserted itself in the lawsuit by filing the brief, claiming, "We issued a subpoena to ensure transparency around their involvement and funding. This is a routine step in litigation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Calvin alleged that OpenAI's subpoena has little to do with the brief and more to do with Encode's advocacy, NBC News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe OpenAI used the pretext of their lawsuit against Elon Musk to intimidate their critics and imply that Elon is behind all of them," Calvin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nonprofits raged over OpenAI's alleged intimidation tactics, litigator Ray Seilie told NBC News that OpenAI's request to subpoena Calvin could have been even more demanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If OpenAI had wanted to intimidate or harass him, they could have served him with a deposition subpoena, which would have required Calvin to sit down for a full day of questioning under oath by OpenAI’s lawyers in addition to providing documents," Seilie said. "The fact that OpenAI only asked for documents suggests that they were sincerely looking for connections between Musk and Encode, even if they turned out to be wrong about their suspicion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Robert Weissman, co-president of a consumer advocacy group not yet targeted by OpenAI, Public Citizen, told NBC News that the subpoenas appear to seek private information from some of OpenAI's loudest critics to "chill speech and deter them from speaking out." The overly broad requests seem overtly shady, Weissman said, like "the kind of tactic you would expect from the most cutthroat for-profit corporation."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“This behavior is highly unusual," Weissman said. "It’s 100 percent intended to intimidate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI faces criticism on subpoenas from within&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some current and former OpenAI employees were bothered enough to speak out about the subpoenas, including Joshua Achiam, OpenAI's head of mission alignment. "This doesn't seem great," he wrote, sharing "thoughts" with the public and noting "all views are my own."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Elon is certainly out to get us, and the man has got an extensive reach," Achiam said. "But there is so much that is public that we can fight him on."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While claiming he would not be at OpenAI if the company didn't have "an extremely sincere commitment to good," he acknowledged that "we can't be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Achiam, the main takeaway of the controversy—which he ranks below OpenAI's prior scandal silencing employees with a non-disparagement clause—is that OpenAI's public trust depends on the company receiving pushback from employees like him on any "dangerously incorrect use of power."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without someone speaking up once in a while it can get worse. So, this is my pushback," Achiam wrote, closing a thread where the initial post got about 570,000 views but later posts only attracted around 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The clear lesson from that was: if we want to be a trusted power in the world, we have to earn that trust, and we can burn it all up if we ever even &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to put the little guy in our crosshairs," Achiam wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Musk seized the moment to fan the flames of social media criticism, reposting an X post from Helen Toner, a former member of OpenAI’s board, who criticized OpenAI's "dishonesty and intimidation" tactics in sending the subpoenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OpenAI was built on a lie," Musk wrote in a post garnering almost 30 million views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the targeted groups, Encode filed an amicus brief supporting Musk in the OpenAI lawsuit, with Calvin arguing that "OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in order to protect" their commitment to building AI that benefits the public, "and the public interest requires they keep their word."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On X, Kwon said Encode had inserted itself in the lawsuit by filing the brief, claiming, "We issued a subpoena to ensure transparency around their involvement and funding. This is a routine step in litigation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Calvin alleged that OpenAI's subpoena has little to do with the brief and more to do with Encode's advocacy, NBC News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe OpenAI used the pretext of their lawsuit against Elon Musk to intimidate their critics and imply that Elon is behind all of them," Calvin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nonprofits raged over OpenAI's alleged intimidation tactics, litigator Ray Seilie told NBC News that OpenAI's request to subpoena Calvin could have been even more demanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If OpenAI had wanted to intimidate or harass him, they could have served him with a deposition subpoena, which would have required Calvin to sit down for a full day of questioning under oath by OpenAI’s lawyers in addition to providing documents," Seilie said. "The fact that OpenAI only asked for documents suggests that they were sincerely looking for connections between Musk and Encode, even if they turned out to be wrong about their suspicion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Robert Weissman, co-president of a consumer advocacy group not yet targeted by OpenAI, Public Citizen, told NBC News that the subpoenas appear to seek private information from some of OpenAI's loudest critics to "chill speech and deter them from speaking out." The overly broad requests seem overtly shady, Weissman said, like "the kind of tactic you would expect from the most cutthroat for-profit corporation."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This behavior is highly unusual," Weissman said. "It’s 100 percent intended to intimidate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI faces criticism on subpoenas from within&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some current and former OpenAI employees were bothered enough to speak out about the subpoenas, including Joshua Achiam, OpenAI's head of mission alignment. "This doesn't seem great," he wrote, sharing "thoughts" with the public and noting "all views are my own."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Elon is certainly out to get us, and the man has got an extensive reach," Achiam said. "But there is so much that is public that we can fight him on."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While claiming he would not be at OpenAI if the company didn't have "an extremely sincere commitment to good," he acknowledged that "we can't be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Achiam, the main takeaway of the controversy—which he ranks below OpenAI's prior scandal silencing employees with a non-disparagement clause—is that OpenAI's public trust depends on the company receiving pushback from employees like him on any "dangerously incorrect use of power."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without someone speaking up once in a while it can get worse. So, this is my pushback," Achiam wrote, closing a thread where the initial post got about 570,000 views but later posts only attracted around 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The clear lesson from that was: if we want to be a trusted power in the world, we have to earn that trust, and we can burn it all up if we ever even &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to put the little guy in our crosshairs," Achiam wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Musk seized the moment to fan the flames of social media criticism, reposting an X post from Helen Toner, a former member of OpenAI’s board, who criticized OpenAI's "dishonesty and intimidation" tactics in sending the subpoenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OpenAI was built on a lie," Musk wrote in a post garnering almost 30 million views.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We trained DeepSomatic on three of the breast cancer genomes and the two lung cancer genomes in the CASTLE reference dataset. We then tested DeepSomatic’s performance in several ways, including on the single breast cancer genome that was not included in its training data, and on chromosome 1 from each sample, which we also excluded from the training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that DeepSomatic models developed for each of the three major sequencing platforms performed better than other methods, identifying more tumor variants with higher accuracy. The tools used for comparison on short-read sequencing data were SomaticSniper, MuTect2 and Strelka2 (with SomaticSniper specifically for single nucleotide variants, or SNVs). For long-read sequencing data we compared against ClairS, a deep learning model trained on synthetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our tests DeepSomatic identified 329,011 somatic variants across the six reference cell lines and a seventh preserved sample. DeepSomatic does particularly well at identifying cancer variations that involve insertions and deletions (“Indels”) of genetic code. For these types of variants, DeepSomatic substantially increased the F1-score, a balanced measure of how well the model finds true variants in a sample (recall) while not making false positives (precision). On Illumina sequencing data the next-best method scored 80% at identifying Indels, while DeepSomatic scored 90%. On Pacific Biosciences sequencing data, the next-best method scored less than 50% at identifying Indels, and DeepSomatic scored more than 80%.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've even idly checked in on the robust world of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; fan development in recent years, you've probably encountered one of the hundreds of gameplay mods, WAD files, or entire commercial games based on &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt;. The open source &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; port—which can trace its lineage back to the original launch of &lt;em&gt;ZDoom&lt;/em&gt; back in 1998—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to the original &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; source code that John Carmack released in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, the community behind &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork called UZDoom. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; creator and maintainer Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl), who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we've decided that the best course of action was to fork the project," developer Nash Muhandes wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday. "I don't want to see the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI-way or the highway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahl's project leadership has generated plenty of friction within the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; development community over the years—this Reddit thread provides a brief history of some of the drama. But the inciting incident leading to this week's &lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; split seems to center in large part on Zahl's open use of AI-generated code in a recent &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; update. While such use of AI coding tools is often hard to identify from the outside (as Zahl himself noted in a GitHub post), this particular instance was highlighted by Zahl's own commented code snippet: "This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on Linux."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That comment led to a lengthy discussion among developers about the use of "stolen scraped code that we have no way of verifying is compatible with the GPL," as one described it. And while Zahl eventually removed the offending code, he also allegedly tried to remove the evidence that it ever existed by force-pushing an update to delete the discussion entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="ars-pullquote large "&gt;&lt;div class="pullquote-content"&gt;// This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pullquote-attribution"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Graf Zahl code comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahl defended the use of AI-generated snippets for "boilerplate code" that isn't key to underlying game features. "I surely have my reservations about using AI for project specific code," he wrote, "but this here is just superficial checks of system configuration settings that can be found on various websites—just with 10x the effort required."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others in the community were adamant that there's no place for AI tools in the workflow of an open source project like this. "If using code slop generated from ChatGPT or any other GenAI/AI chatbots is the future of this project, I'm sorry to say but I'm out," GitHub user Cacodemon345 wrote, summarizing the feelings of many other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A fork in the road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a GitHub bug report posted Tuesday, user the-phinet laid out the disagreements over AI-generated code alongside other alleged issues with Zahl's top-down approach to pushing out &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; updates. In response, Zahl invited the development community to "feel free to fork the project" if they were so displeased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; developers quickly took that somewhat petulant response seriously. "You have just completely bricked &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; with this bullshit," developer Boondorl wrote. "Enjoy your dead project, I'm sure you'll be happy to plink away at it all by yourself where people can finally stop yelling at you to do things."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a community update posted to the &lt;em&gt;ZDoom&lt;/em&gt; Discord, moderator Agent_Ash promised that the new &lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; will maintain compatibility with old &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; saves and mods while adding new planned features in the future. But the new project will also provide "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads,'" Agent_Ash wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Reddit thread discussing the UZDoom fork, Muhandes detailed how "&lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; gets rid of the 'one man decides everything' / 'my way or the highway' development model. Everyone has to make pull requests that must be peer-reviewed thoroughly, and everything will be transparent—no one is allowed to commit directly to the master branch."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have never seen something I've worked so hard on, for the past 2+ decades—a life passion of mine, you could say—implode this hard," Muhandes added on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; will continue to exist, Agent_Ash wrote that "it's reasonable to assume that &lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; will be the 'main' flagship version of the engine moving forward." And while Zahl will be welcome to continue contributing to the new project, "&lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; will not be led by him and he's not going to have a final say on new features and changes," Agent_Ash added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infighting over a modern source port of a 32-year-old game speaks highly of the deep cultural impact &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; continues to have on multiple generations of fans. Going forward, it's hard to say how this dramatic split will affect the continued development of what has become a load-bearing part of the game's continued legacy. For now, though, the move highlights how the use of AI coding tools has become a non-negotiable flashpoint for many in the world of open-source game development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've even idly checked in on the robust world of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; fan development in recent years, you've probably encountered one of the hundreds of gameplay mods, WAD files, or entire commercial games based on &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt;. The open source &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; port—which can trace its lineage back to the original launch of &lt;em&gt;ZDoom&lt;/em&gt; back in 1998—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to the original &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; source code that John Carmack released in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, though, the community behind &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork called UZDoom. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; creator and maintainer Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl), who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we've decided that the best course of action was to fork the project," developer Nash Muhandes wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday. "I don't want to see the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI-way or the highway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahl's project leadership has generated plenty of friction within the &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; development community over the years—this Reddit thread provides a brief history of some of the drama. But the inciting incident leading to this week's &lt;em&gt;UZDoom&lt;/em&gt; split seems to center in large part on Zahl's open use of AI-generated code in a recent &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; update. While such use of AI coding tools is often hard to identify from the outside (as Zahl himself noted in a GitHub post), this particular instance was highlighted by Zahl's own commented code snippet: "This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on Linux."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;That comment led to a lengthy discussion among developers about the use of "stolen scraped code that we have no way of verifying is compatible with the GPL," as one described it. And while Zahl eventually removed the offending code, he also allegedly tried to remove the evidence that it ever existed by force-pushing an update to delete the discussion entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="ars-pullquote large "&gt;&lt;div class="pullquote-content"&gt;// This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pullquote-attribution"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Graf Zahl code comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zahl defended the use of AI-generated snippets for "boilerplate code" that isn't key to underlying game features. "I surely have my reservations about using AI for project specific code," he wrote, "but this here is just superficial checks of system configuration settings that can be found on various websites—just with 10x the effort required."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others in the community were adamant that there's no place for AI tools in the workflow of an open source project like this. "If using code slop generated from ChatGPT or any other GenAI/AI chatbots is the future of this project, I'm sorry to say but I'm out," GitHub user Cacodemon345 wrote, summarizing the feelings of many other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A fork in the road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a GitHub bug report posted Tuesday, user the-phinet laid out the disagreements over AI-generated code alongside other alleged issues with Zahl's top-down approach to pushing out &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; updates. In response, Zahl invited the development community to "feel free to fork the project" if they were so displeased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; developers quickly took that somewhat petulant response seriously. "You have just completely bricked &lt;em&gt;GZDoom&lt;/em&gt; with this bullshit," developer Boondorl wrote. "Enjoy your dead project, I'm sure you'll be happy to plink away at it all by yourself where people can finally stop yelling at you to do things."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The companies plan will simulate the plasma that will burn inside CFS’s reactor using specialized DeepMind software known as Torax. They also plan on pairing Torax with AI models to help CFS figure out how best to achieve fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fusion power promises to deliver massive amounts of electricity with zero emissions from a near limitless source of fuel: water. AI-related companies have been bullish on fusion startups as a source of electricity to power energy-hungry data centers. Google appears to be eyeing them as potential customer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t Google’s first foray into nuclear fusion. The tech company has worked with another fusion startup, TAE Technologies, to use AI to study how plasma behaves inside TAE’s fusion machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a reason Google keeps coming back to the problem: AI might be uniquely suited to making fusion power possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the biggest challenges facing fusion startups is keeping the plasma inside a reactor hot enough for long enough. Unlike nuclear fission reactions, which are self-sustaining, fusion reactions are difficult to maintain outside of stars like the Sun. Without that sort of mass and gravity, the plasma is constantly in danger of diffusing and snuffing itself out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In CFS’s reactors, powerful magnets substitute for gravity to help corral the plasma, but they’re not perfect. Reactor operators have to develop control software that can enable the device to continuously react to changing plasma conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Problem is, there are almost too many knobs to turn, certainly more than a human is capable of. That’s the sort of problem that AI excels at. Experts have cited AI as one of the key technologies that has enabled the industry’s remarkable advances over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CFS is currently building Sparc, its demonstration reactor, in a suburb outside Boston. The device is about two-thirds completed, and when finished later in 2026, the startup is predicting that it will be the first fusion device capable of producing more power than the plant needs to run itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said Torax can be used with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search models to find the “most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy.” The two companies are also exploring whether AI can be used to control the reactor’s operation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In August, Google participated in CFS’s $863 million Series B2 round alongside Nvidia. Earlier this year, Google also said it would buy 200 megawatts of electricity from CFS’s first commercial power plant, Arc, which is planned to be built outside Richmond, Virginia. The tech company is also an investor in CFS competitor TAE Technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184776204.jpeg?resize=1200,857" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Energy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems said Thursday it’s working with Google’s DeepMind division to fine tune — and even improve — the operation of its forthcoming Sparc reactor using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
