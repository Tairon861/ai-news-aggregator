&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk wrote in an X post on Monday that AI companions are now available in the Grok app for “Super Grok” subscribers who pay $30 per month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to posts that Musk has shared, it seems that there are at least two available AI companions: Ani, an anime girl in a tight corset and short black dress with thigh-high fishnets, and Bad Rudy, a 3D fox creature.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is pretty cool,” Musk wrote, then shared a photo of the blonde-pigtailed goth anime girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given that this paywalled feature only just launched, we do not yet know if these “companions” are designed to serve as romantic interests or if they are more like different skins for Grok. But some companies are certainly catering to romantic AI relationships, even though these relationships can prove unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI, for example, is currently facing multiple lawsuits from the parents of children who have used the platform, which they deem unsafe; in one case, the parents are suing after a chatbot encouraged their child to kill his parents. In another case, the chatbot told a child to kill himself, and he followed through soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even for adults, it can be risky to depend on AI chatbots for emotional support; a recent paper found “significant risks” in people using chatbots like “companions, confidants, and therapists.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given that xAI just spent the last week failing to rein in an antisemitic Grok that called itself “MechaHitler,” it’s a bold choice to create even more personalities on Grok.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/grok.jpg?resize=1200,674" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok has pivoted from antisemitism to anime girl waifus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, users seeking alternatives will find a variety of browsers aiming to challenge these industry giants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help navigate the competitive landscape of the browser wars, we’ve compiled an overview of some of the top alternative browsers available today. This includes browsers leveraging AI, open source browsers that promote customization and privacy, and “mindful browsers” — a new term that refers to browsers designed to enhance user well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-browsers"&gt;AI-powered browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3025962" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cmp_summarize_webpage.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Perplexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perplexity-s-comet"&gt;Perplexity’s Comet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity is the most recent startup in the space to launch an AI-powered web browser. Called Comet, the company’s new product acts as a chatbot-based search engine, and can perform actions like summarizing emails, browsing web pages, and performing tasks such as sending calendar invites. It’s currently only available to users with Perplexity’s $200/month Max plan, but there’s also a waitlist where people can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-browser-company-s-dia"&gt;The Browser Company’s Dia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dia Hero" class="wp-image-3017691" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dia-Hero-2-w_Write-Skill.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;The Browser Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, recently introduced Dia, its AI-centric browser that looks similar to Google Chrome but with an AI chat tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently available as an invite-only beta, Dia is designed to help users navigate the web more easily. It’s able to look at every website that a user has visited and every website they’re logged into, enabling it to help you find information and perform tasks. For instance, Dia can provide information about the page a user is currently browsing, answer questions about a product, and summarize uploaded files.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To get early access to Dia, users have to be an Arc member. Non-members can join the waitlist.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-s-neon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opera’s Neon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Opera neon" class="wp-image-3012375" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Opera-neon.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another recent entry into the AI agentic browser war is Opera’s Neon, which has contextual awareness and can do things like researching, shopping, and writing snippets of code. Notably, it can even perform tasks while the user is offline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon has yet to become available, but people can join the waitlist. It will be a subscription product; however, Opera hasn’t announced pricing yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-rumored-browser-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s rumored browser&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Reuters, OpenAI may also be releasing an AI-powered web browser as soon as July. The browser is reported to operate inside ChatGPT, letting users browse websites inside the chatbot instead of directing to outside links.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-focused-browsers"&gt;Privacy-focused browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027643" height="180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bravebrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Brave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brave"&gt;Brave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brave is among the more well-known privacy-first browsers, popular for its built-in ad and tracker blocking capabilities. It also has a gamified approach to browsing, rewarding users with its own cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT). When users choose to opt in to view ads, supporting their favorite websites, they get a share of the ad revenue. Additional features include a VPN service, an AI assistant, and a video calling feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-duckduckgo"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2426668" height="472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Desktop-Home-1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DuckDuckGo is another browser that many people are probably already familiar with, thanks to its search engine by the same name. Launched in 2008, the company recently made significant investments in its browser to stay competitive by introducing generative AI features, such as a chatbot. It also enhanced its scam blocker to detect a wider range of scams, including fake cryptocurrency exchanges, scareware tactics, and fraudulent e-commerce websites. In addition to blocking scams, DuckDuckGo prevents trackers and ads, and it doesn’t track user data, resulting in fewer pop-ups for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ladybird"&gt;Ladybird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027645" height="462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ladybird-browser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ladybird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ladybird, led by GitHub co-founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath, has an ambitious mission compared to other rivals: it aims to build an entirely new open source browser from scratch. This means it will not rely on code from existing browsers, a feat that has rarely been accomplished. Most alternative web browsers depend on the Chromium open source project maintained by Google, which is the most widely used base for many browsers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other privacy-focused browsers, Ladybird will offer features to minimize data collection, such as a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. The browser has yet to be launched, with an alpha version scheduled for release in 2026 for early adopters, available on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vivaldi"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027646" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vivaldi.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser created by one of the original developers of the Opera browser. Its biggest selling point is its customizable user interface, which allows users to change the appearance and enable or disable features. One unique feature is that the browser window changes color to match the website being viewed. Other key features include ad blocking, a password manager, no user data tracking, and productivity tools such as a calendar and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-niche-browsers"&gt;Niche browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2958415" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Air-Boosts.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-air"&gt;Opera Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera launched the Air browser in February, becoming one of the first mindfulness-themed browsers in the space. While Opera Air functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. These features consist of break reminders and breathing exercises. Another feature, called “Boosts,” provides a selection of binaural beats to either help improve focus or relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sigmaos"&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2683085" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SigmaOS.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is a Mac-only browser featuring a workspace-style interface that emphasizes productivity. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can create workspaces — essentially groups of tabs — to better organize different activities, such as separating work from entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This Y Combinator-backed browser has been around for a few years now and has most recently begun introducing more AI features, including the ability to summarize various elements of a web page, such as ratings, reviews, and prices. It also has an AI assistant that can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is free to use, but users who want more than three workspaces can subscribe to a plan for $8 per month, which provides unlimited workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zen-browser"&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027651" height="456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zenbrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zen Browser aims to create a “calmer internet” with its open source browser. Zen lets users organize tabs into Workspaces, and offers Split View to view two tabs side by side, among other productivity-focused features. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari currently dominate the web browser market, with Chrome holding a significant share due to the tech giant’s ongoing innovations, particularly in integrating generative AI into its search functionalities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other privacy-focused browsers, Ladybird will offer features to minimize data collection, such as a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. The browser has yet to be launched, with an alpha version scheduled for release in 2026 for early adopters, available on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser created by one of the original developers of the Opera browser. Its biggest selling point is its customizable user interface, which allows users to change the appearance and enable or disable features. One unique feature is that the browser window changes color to match the website being viewed. Other key features include ad blocking, a password manager, no user data tracking, and productivity tools such as a calendar and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-air"&gt;Opera Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera launched the Air browser in February, becoming one of the first mindfulness-themed browsers in the space. While Opera Air functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. These features consist of break reminders and breathing exercises. Another feature, called “Boosts,” provides a selection of binaural beats to either help improve focus or relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sigmaos"&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is a Mac-only browser featuring a workspace-style interface that emphasizes productivity. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can create workspaces — essentially groups of tabs — to better organize different activities, such as separating work from entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This Y Combinator-backed browser has been around for a few years now and has most recently begun introducing more AI features, including the ability to summarize various elements of a web page, such as ratings, reviews, and prices. It also has an AI assistant that can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is free to use, but users who want more than three workspaces can subscribe to a plan for $8 per month, which provides unlimited workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zen Browser aims to create a “calmer internet” with its open source browser. Zen lets users organize tabs into Workspaces, and offers Split View to view two tabs side by side, among other productivity-focused features. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:38:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Remaining Windsurf team and tech acquired by Cognition, makers of Devin: ‘We’re friends with Anthropic again’ (AI News | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/remaining-windsurf-team-and-tech-acquired-by-cognition-makers-of-devin-were-friends-with-anthropic-again/</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]Cognition CEO Scott Wu and interim Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said they would start by integrating the AI-powered engineer Devin into Windsurf.</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]Cognition CEO Scott Wu and interim Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said they would start by integrating the AI-powered engineer Devin into Windsurf.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/remaining-windsurf-team-and-tech-acquired-by-cognition-makers-of-devin-were-friends-with-anthropic-again/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:46:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cognition, maker of the AI coding agent Devin, acquires Windsurf (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.44.29PM.png?resize=1200,616" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cognition, the startup behind the viral AI coding agent Devin, announced in a blog post on Monday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire AI coding startup Windsurf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes just days after Google hired away Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and research leaders in a $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire that left much of the startup’s 250-person team behind. Google’s deal occurred just hours after OpenAI’s $3 billion offer to acquire Windsurf expired, clearing the way for the AI coding startup to explore other options. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The frenzy around Windsurf represents a new peak in the wild race to develop AI coding tools — specifically, the AI-powered integrated development environments (IDEs) that Cursor and Windsurf offer. In recent months, the businesses around AI-powered IDEs have skyrocketed, pushing Cursor’s annualized recurring revenue (ARR) to $500 million. While Windsurf’s business is smaller than Cursor’s, it has achieved impressive growth in the last year, garnering interest from several larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The last 72 hours have been the wildest rollercoaster ride of my career,” said Jeff Wang, Windsurf’s former head of business, who was made interim CEO of the startup days ago after Google hired the startup’s leaders, in a post on LinkedIn. “To our new teammates at Cognition:&amp;nbsp;we at Windsurf feel incredibly lucky to be joining a team that shares our vision, our deep commitment to our users, and — most importantly — our values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition says it’s acquiring Windsurf’s IP and product, which include its AI-powered IDE, alongside all of the employees who were not hired by Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition did not announce the price it acquired Windsurf for; however, the company says Windsurf reached $82 million in ARR, with enterprise ARR doubling quarter-over-quarter. Cognition says Windsurf’s user base reached at least 350 enterprise customers and “hundreds of thousands” of daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the near term, Windsurf’s team will continue working on its AI-powered IDE, while Cognition works on its AI coding agent, Devin, the companies said in a press release. Eventually, Cognition says it will integrate Windsurf’s IP and capabilities into its own products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reported in April that Windsurf’s ARR had reached $100 million at one point. However, Anthropic — which offers some of the most popular AI models for coding tasks — cut Windsurf’s direct access to its Claude AI models in June, with Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan attributing the decision to rumors that OpenAI, its largest competitor, was close to acquiring Windsurf. Several Windsurf customers told TechCrunch they switched to other services that offered Claude AI models, such as Cursor, in light of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition notes in its press release that Windsurf will now have full access to Claude AI models once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the weekend, The Information reported that Windsurf employees who had joined in the last year did not receive a payout in Google’s billion-dollar reverse-acquihire. That prompted many users on social media to scoff at the deal, which seemed to largely benefit investors and leaders at the startup.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition president Russell Kaplan indicated in a post on X that the Windsurf acquisition truly came together over the weekend, just hours after the Google deal was made public. He noted that the first call was made after 5 p.m. on Friday and that an agreement was signed Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition notes in its blog post that 100% of Windsurf employees will participate financially in this deal and have vesting cliffs waived for their work to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the addition of Windsurf’s talent and IP, Cognition may have a supercharged startup to compete with giants in the AI coding space, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cursor. In March, Cognition reportedly held talks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a $4 billion valuation. It’s unclear if the round closed, but Cognition may need such a war chest to compete in the AI coding space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cognition was one of the first AI startups to launch a fully fledged AI coding agent, Devin, which didn’t just help with tasks, but also promised to automate them completely as if it were a junior software engineer. This was a markedly bold approach compared to Cursor and Windsurf, which offered environments for developers to easily access AI tools. However, early reviews found that Devin made mistakes, perhaps indicating that its AI agent technology was ahead of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That may no longer be the case. In recent months, Cursor and Windsurf have started offering more agentic AI products that are starting to resemble what Cognition offers. In a recent interview, Cursor CEO Michael Truell said he believes AI reasoning models are advancing enough to make coding agents viable and that he expects 20% of coding workflows to be handled by agents by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now Cognition has the versatility of offering both AI coding agents and an AI-powered IDE, perhaps enhancing its value proposition. Earlier this week, Cognition also landed a major customer in the Wall Street juggernaut Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the acquisition of Windsurf, it seems Cognition has become a more serious competitor in the AI coding space.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.44.29PM.png?resize=1200,616" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cognition, the startup behind the viral AI coding agent Devin, announced in a blog post on Monday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire AI coding startup Windsurf.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;When it comes to concrete use cases for large language models, AI companies love to point out the ways coders and software developers can use these models to increase their productivity and overall efficiency in creating computer code. However, a new randomized controlled trial has found that experienced open source coders became less efficient at coding-related tasks when they used current AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their study, researchers at METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) recruited 16 software developers, each with multiple years of experience working on specific open source repositories. The study followed these developers across 246 individual "tasks" involved with maintaining those repos, such as "bug fixes, features, and refactors that would normally be part of their regular work." For half of those tasks, the developers used AI tools like Cursor Pro or Anthropic's Claude; for the others, the programmers were instructed not to use AI assistance. Expected time forecasts for each task (made before the groupings were assigned) were used as a proxy to balance out the overall difficulty of the tasks in each experimental group, and the time needed to fix pull requests based on reviewer feedback was included in the overall assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Experts and the developers themselves expected time savings that didn't materialize when AI tools were actually used.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before performing the study, the developers in question expected the AI tools would lead to a 24 percent reduction in the time needed for their assigned tasks. Even after completing those tasks, the developers believed that the AI tools had made them 20 percent faster, on average. In reality, though, the AI-aided tasks ended up being completed 19 percent &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than those completed without AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing screen recording data from a subset of the studied developers, the METR researchers found that AI tools tended to reduce the average time those developers spent actively coding, testing/debugging, or "reading/searching for information." But those time savings were overwhelmed in the end by "time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and waiting for AI generations," as well as "idle/overhead time" where the screen recordings show no activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the developers in the study accepted less than 44 percent of the code generated by AI without modification. A majority of the developers reported needing to make changes to the code generated by their AI companion, and a total of 9 percent of the total task time in the "AI-assisted" portion of the study was taken up by this kind of review.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, METR's results seem to contradict other benchmarks and experiments that demonstrate increases in coding efficiency when AI tools are used. But those often also measure productivity in terms of total lines of code or the number of discrete tasks/code commits/pull requests completed, all of which can be poor proxies for actual coding efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the existing coding benchmarks also focus on synthetic, algorithmically scorable tasks created specifically for the benchmark test, making it hard to compare those results to those focused on work with pre-existing, real-world code bases. Along those lines, the developers in METR's study reported in surveys that the overall complexity of the repos they work with (which average 10 years of age and over 1 million lines of code) limited how helpful the AI could be. The AI wasn't able to utilize "important tacit knowledge or context" about the codebase, the researchers note, while the "high developer familiarity with [the] repositories" aided their very human coding efficiency in these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors lead the researchers to conclude that current AI coding tools may be particularly ill-suited to "settings with very high quality standards, or with many implicit requirements (e.g., relating to documentation, testing coverage, or linting/formatting) that take humans substantial time to learn." While those factors may not apply in "many realistic, economically relevant settings" involving simpler code bases, they could limit the impact of AI tools in this study and similar real-world situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even for complex coding projects like the ones studied, the researchers are also optimistic that further refinement of AI tools could lead to future efficiency gains for programmers. Systems that have better reliability, lower latency, or more relevant outputs (via techniques such as prompt scaffolding or fine-tuning) "could speed up developers in our setting," the researchers write. Already, they say there is "preliminary evidence" that the recent release of Claude 3.7 "can often correctly implement the core functionality of issues on several repositories that are included in our study."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, however, METR's study provides some strong evidence that AI's much-vaunted usefulness for coding tasks may have significant limitations&amp;nbsp;in certain complex, real-world coding scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;When it comes to concrete use cases for large language models, AI companies love to point out the ways coders and software developers can use these models to increase their productivity and overall efficiency in creating computer code. However, a new randomized controlled trial has found that experienced open source coders became less efficient at coding-related tasks when they used current AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their study, researchers at METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) recruited 16 software developers, each with multiple years of experience working on specific open source repositories. The study followed these developers across 246 individual "tasks" involved with maintaining those repos, such as "bug fixes, features, and refactors that would normally be part of their regular work." For half of those tasks, the developers used AI tools like Cursor Pro or Anthropic's Claude; for the others, the programmers were instructed not to use AI assistance. Expected time forecasts for each task (made before the groupings were assigned) were used as a proxy to balance out the overall difficulty of the tasks in each experimental group, and the time needed to fix pull requests based on reviewer feedback was included in the overall assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

      Experts and the developers themselves expected time savings that didn't materialize when AI tools were actually used.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before performing the study, the developers in question expected the AI tools would lead to a 24 percent reduction in the time needed for their assigned tasks. Even after completing those tasks, the developers believed that the AI tools had made them 20 percent faster, on average. In reality, though, the AI-aided tasks ended up being completed 19 percent &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than those completed without AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing screen recording data from a subset of the studied developers, the METR researchers found that AI tools tended to reduce the average time those developers spent actively coding, testing/debugging, or "reading/searching for information." But those time savings were overwhelmed in the end by "time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and waiting for AI generations," as well as "idle/overhead time" where the screen recordings show no activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the developers in the study accepted less than 44 percent of the code generated by AI without modification. A majority of the developers reported needing to make changes to the code generated by their AI companion, and a total of 9 percent of the total task time in the "AI-assisted" portion of the study was taken up by this kind of review.&lt;/p&gt;

This year, Meta has already taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, it has taken action against 500,000 accounts that were engaged in “spammy behavior or fake engagement.” Those actions have included things like demoting the accounts’ comments and reducing the distribution of their content to prevent the accounts from monetizing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos — things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like YouTube, Meta says it won’t penalize users who are engaging with other people’s content, doing things like making reaction videos, joining a trend, or adding their own takes. Instead, Meta’s focus is on the reposting of others’ content, either on spam accounts or those that pretend to belong to the original creator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Accounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else’s content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. When Facebook detects duplicate videos, it will also reduce the distribution of the copies to ensure the original creator gets the views and credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the company said it’s testing a system that adds links on duplicate videos that point viewers to the original content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update arrives as Meta weathers criticism from users across its platforms, including Instagram, about erroneous, over-enforcement of its policies through automated means. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Meta’s newest crackdown is focused more on accounts that steal others’ content for profit, issues around unoriginal content are growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the rise of AI technology, platforms have become flooded with AI slop, a term referencing low-quality media content made using generative AI. On YouTube, for instance, it’s&amp;nbsp;easy&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;find&amp;nbsp;an AI voice overlaid on photos, video clips, or other repurposed content, thanks to text-to-video AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s update seemingly only focuses on reused content, but its post suggests that it may be taking AI slop into consideration, too. In a section where the company offers “tips” for making original content, Meta notes that creators shouldn’t just be “stitching together clips” or adding their watermark when using content from other sources, and they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Without directly saying so, these types of unoriginal videos are also things that AI tools have made it easier to produce, as low-quality videos will often feature a series of just images or clips (either real or AI), with added AI narration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the post, Meta also warns creators not to reuse content from other apps or sources, which has been a longstanding rule. It also notes that video captions should be high quality, which could mean cutting down on the use of automated AI captions that aren’t edited by the creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027730" height="653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/518277668_24017296104593113_8222195989969441417_n.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta says these changes will roll out gradually over the months ahead, so Facebook creators have time to adjust. If creators think their content isn’t being distributed, they can view the new post-level insights in Facebook’s Professional Dashboard to see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators will also be able to see if they’re at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties in the Support home screen from their Page or professional profile’s main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta typically shares information about its content takedowns in its quarterly Transparency Reports. In the last quarter, Meta said that 3% of its worldwide monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts, and it had taken action on 1 billion fake accounts from January through March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More recently, Meta has backed away from fact-checking content itself in favor of Community Notes in the U.S., similar to X, which allows users and contributors to determine if posts follow Meta’s Community Standards and are accurate.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta announced on Monday that it will take additional measures to crack down on accounts sharing “unoriginal” content to Facebook, meaning those that repeatedly reuse someone else’s text, photos, or videos. This year, Meta has already taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, it has taken action against 500,000 accounts that were engaged in “spammy behavior or fake engagement.” Those actions have included things like demoting the accounts’ comments and reducing the distribution of their content to prevent the accounts from monetizing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos — things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like YouTube, Meta says it won’t penalize users who are engaging with other people’s content, doing things like making reaction videos, joining a trend, or adding their own takes. Instead, Meta’s focus is on the reposting of others’ content, either on spam accounts or those that pretend to belong to the original creator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Accounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else’s content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. When Facebook detects duplicate videos, it will also reduce the distribution of the copies to ensure the original creator gets the views and credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the company said it’s testing a system that adds links on duplicate videos that point viewers to the original content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027731" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/518325353_1230476428289887_995133977579823940_n.webp?w=332" width="332" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update arrives as Meta weathers criticism from users across its platforms, including Instagram, about erroneous, over-enforcement of its policies through automated means. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css","className":"is-style-wide"} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the big news that Windsurf is being acquired by Cognition (after its founders went to Google), developers interested in AI-powered coding may be on the hunt for new alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a bit of fortuitous timing, today also saw Amazon’s release of Kiro, a new agentic integrated development environment (IDE) built to help developers move from prototype to production using AI workflows grounded in structure, planning and engineering rigor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0 as the default model backends. Users can switch between them, and future support for other models may be added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in public preview, Kiro runs on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows and Linux for free to start (limited to 50 interactions per user per month), with additional pricing tiers starting at $19 for more features.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-should-developers-check-out-kiro"&gt;Why should developers check out Kiro?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro aims to bridge the gap between “vibe coding” — allowing AI to generate full blocks of code or entire software processes and applications from plain text instructions, typically for rapid prototyping and iteration — and the more demanding process of delivering secure, maintainable and scalable applications in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tool combines AI agents with project specifications, technical architecture and automated task management to support a complete software development lifecycle inside a single interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kiro-vs-q-developer"&gt;Kiro vs. Q Developer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But didn’t Amazon already have its own AI-code completion tool, Q Developer? Yes, and that’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why launch a whole new product and brand name that offers some of the same functionality? Sources at Amazon told VentureBeat that “Kiro&amp;nbsp;is a general-purpose agentic IDE for developers to work with any platform of their choice,” as opposed to Q Developer, which is more limited in its support for third-party IDEs, restricted to VSCode, JetBrains, Eclipse and Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the sources pointed out that Kiro’s agentic spec-driven development was radically different from the code suggestions offered on discrete snippets by Q Developer. They said some developers may even prefer to use both in tandem, which is supported via the Q Developer Pro subscription which starts at $19 per month per user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-prompt-to-production-with-spec-driven-development"&gt;From prompt to production with spec-driven development&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s key differentiator is its spec-driven development model, which guides the process from ideation to implementation. A simple prompt like “add a review system” triggers a chain of AI-assisted outputs that include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User stories with acceptance criteria&lt;/strong&gt; in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design documents&lt;/strong&gt; with data flow diagrams, TypeScript interfaces and API schemas;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task lists and sub-tasks&lt;/strong&gt; automatically sequenced by dependency, with tests, loading states and accessibility built-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can execute these tasks one at a time through Kiro’s built-in agent interface, with inline diffs, progress tracking and access to historical agent execution logs. As development proceeds, Kiro keeps specs in sync with the codebase, helping teams avoid the typical drift between documentation and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agent-hooks-automate-routine-quality-tasks"&gt;Agent hooks automate routine quality tasks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s &lt;strong&gt;agent hooks&lt;/strong&gt; allow developers to configure automation triggers for everyday tasks like regenerating tests, updating documentation or running security scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hooks can be tied to actions such as saving files, editing components or pushing commits. Once set up and checked into the repo, they provide team-wide consistency in code quality and standards enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, developers can define a hook to ensure new React components follow the ‘Single Responsibility Principle’ or trigger a secrets scan before commits. This approach adds automated quality control without slowing down individual developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Kiro is built on Code OSS, the open-source foundation of Visual Studio Code maintained by Microsoft. It provides the core editor experience without proprietary services, allowing third parties like Kiro to build their own IDEs with full compatibility with VS Code extensions and settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As such, Kiro remains compatible with VS Code extensions, settings and UI conventions. It also supports:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt; for connecting external tools;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic multi-modal chat&lt;/strong&gt;, using files, URLs or documents as context;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering rules&lt;/strong&gt; to customize and constrain agent behavior across a codebase;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social login via &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, with no AWS account required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-and-availability"&gt;Pricing and availability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro is currently free for all users during its preview period, including Amazon Q Developer and Q Developer Pro subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preview access includes “generous” usage limits aimed at letting developers explore Kiro without frequent disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the preview period ends, users will have a choice of three subscription tiers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Included agentic interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;50 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Specs, hooks, steering and MCP support included&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,000 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;All features from Free, plus higher usage quota&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Pro+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$39&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3,000 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Designed for heavy users or teams&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agentic interactions include any direct invocation of Kiro agents — such as initiating a spec, triggering a hook or sending a chat prompt. The subsequent processing work (like multi-step task execution) does not count toward the quota.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users on paid plans will also be able to purchase additional interactions at $0.04 each, but overage billing must be explicitly enabled.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The AI-assisted development ecosystem is becoming increasingly crowded, with several prominent IDEs and agents competing for developer attention. Here’s how Kiro stacks up:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tool&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pricing&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amazon Q Developer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-environment AI assistant integrated into AWS, IDEs, CLI and chat. Agentic workflows via terminal or IDE. Great for cloud ops, migrations and automation. Free and Pro tiers available.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro at $19/user/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Claude Code (Anthropic)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CLI-first coding assistant with chat-based iteration, plan/edit modes and diff views. Strong for interactive code development, less structured than Kiro.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro at $17/month or $20 billed monthly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GitHub Copilot (Microsoft)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Inline code completion tool in VS Code, GitHub. Best for quick assistance. Lacks structured planning or workflow support.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free trial; Pro $10/month or $100/year; Pro+ $39/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cursor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;VS Code–based AI editor for conversational edits and navigation. Optimized for solo coding, minimal planning support.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro $20/month ($16/month yearly)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Windsurf (OpenAI, acquired)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Discontinued AI IDE focused on rapid code editing. Offered minimal planning. Key staff/IP acquired by Google and Cognition in July 2025.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro $15/month; Teams $30/user/month &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cognition / Devin&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-agent system capable of autonomous software engineering from planning to deployment. Developer-in‑loop model.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Start at $20/month; older tiers at $500/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kiro&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Planning-first AI IDE with structured artifacts like specs, design docs and task trees; supports feature planning, implementation and QA automation. Developer‑in‑loop.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free (50 interactions/mo); Pro: $19/user/mo (1,000 interactions); Pro+: $39/user/mo (3,000 interactions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-showcasing-kiro-in-action-nbsp-spirit-of-kiro"&gt;Showcasing Kiro in action:&amp;nbsp;‘Spirit of Kiro’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate Kiro’s capabilities in a real-world context, Amazon released a full demo project called “Spirit of Kiro”, an open-source crafting game. The project serves as a hands-on example of how Kiro can be used throughout the development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 95% of the game’s codebase was generated by prompting Kiro. The game features unique, procedurally generated items with customizable properties like damage, quirks and enchantments. Players can combine, break down and sell items — providing a complex system that highlights Kiro’s strengths in managing interconnected components and evolving feature sets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The repo includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture documentation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;App security overviews;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A deliberately incomplete sample branch with bugs (for testing spec workflows);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A roadmap with feature ideas for future contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project is also intended as a learning resource. Files like CHALLENGE.md, architecture.md and guiding-principles.md are designed to walk developers through Kiro’s specs, hooks and agentic workflows in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can clone, run or deploy the project locally or on AWS infrastructure, and open-source contributions are welcome via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developer-response-and-early-impressions"&gt;Developer response and early impressions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s launch generated active discussion on startup accelerator Y Combinator’s popular developer forum Hacker News, where Nathan Peck, senior developer advocate for generative AI at AWS (username NathanKP) offered technical context and responded to questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that Kiro reflects Amazon’s internal engineering practices and is designed to help developers scale from small ideas to robust, production-ready systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial community reactions were mixed, but developers were intrigued, praising the emphasis on specs, hooks and structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some compared it favorably to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, citing the improved rigor in building and documenting features. Others voiced concern over tool churn and switching costs, while some preferred command line interface (CLI)-based tools or simpler interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feedback also surfaced around authentication bugs, platform compatibility and desire for dev container support. These early responses reflect both curiosity and the high expectations developers now have for AI coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro enters a crowded field but appears to carve out a niche with its structured, spec-first philosophy and support for developer-in-the-loop workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not trying to replace developers or automate entire codebases blindly. Instead, it’s offering a more disciplined way to collaborate with AI from planning to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its preview now open and pricing models outlined, Kiro may appeal most to teams and individuals looking to build not just faster, but more thoughtfully — with long-term maintainability, clarity and quality built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in public preview, Kiro runs on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows and Linux for free to start (limited to 50 interactions per user per month), with additional pricing tiers starting at $19 for more features.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-should-developers-check-out-kiro"&gt;Why should developers check out Kiro?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro aims to bridge the gap between “vibe coding” — allowing AI to generate full blocks of code or entire software processes and applications from plain text instructions, typically for rapid prototyping and iteration — and the more demanding process of delivering secure, maintainable and scalable applications in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tool combines AI agents with project specifications, technical architecture and automated task management to support a complete software development lifecycle inside a single interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kiro-vs-q-developer"&gt;Kiro vs. Q Developer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But didn’t Amazon already have its own AI-code completion tool, Q Developer? Yes, and that’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why launch a whole new product and brand name that offers some of the same functionality? Sources at Amazon told VentureBeat that “Kiro&amp;nbsp;is a general-purpose agentic IDE for developers to work with any platform of their choice,” as opposed to Q Developer, which is more limited in its support for third-party IDEs, restricted to VSCode, JetBrains, Eclipse and Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the sources pointed out that Kiro’s agentic spec-driven development was radically different from the code suggestions offered on discrete snippets by Q Developer. They said some developers may even prefer to use both in tandem, which is supported via the Q Developer Pro subscription which starts at $19 per month per user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-prompt-to-production-with-spec-driven-development"&gt;From prompt to production with spec-driven development&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s key differentiator is its spec-driven development model, which guides the process from ideation to implementation. A simple prompt like “add a review system” triggers a chain of AI-assisted outputs that include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User stories with acceptance criteria&lt;/strong&gt; in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design documents&lt;/strong&gt; with data flow diagrams, TypeScript interfaces and API schemas;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task lists and sub-tasks&lt;/strong&gt; automatically sequenced by dependency, with tests, loading states and accessibility built-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can execute these tasks one at a time through Kiro’s built-in agent interface, with inline diffs, progress tracking and access to historical agent execution logs. As development proceeds, Kiro keeps specs in sync with the codebase, helping teams avoid the typical drift between documentation and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agent-hooks-automate-routine-quality-tasks"&gt;Agent hooks automate routine quality tasks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s &lt;strong&gt;agent hooks&lt;/strong&gt; allow developers to configure automation triggers for everyday tasks like regenerating tests, updating documentation or running security scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hooks can be tied to actions such as saving files, editing components or pushing commits. Once set up and checked into the repo, they provide team-wide consistency in code quality and standards enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, developers can define a hook to ensure new React components follow the ‘Single Responsibility Principle’ or trigger a secrets scan before commits. This approach adds automated quality control without slowing down individual developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Kiro is built on Code OSS, the open-source foundation of Visual Studio Code maintained by Microsoft. It provides the core editor experience without proprietary services, allowing third parties like Kiro to build their own IDEs with full compatibility with VS Code extensions and settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As such, Kiro remains compatible with VS Code extensions, settings and UI conventions. It also supports:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt; for connecting external tools;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic multi-modal chat&lt;/strong&gt;, using files, URLs or documents as context;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering rules&lt;/strong&gt; to customize and constrain agent behavior across a codebase;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social login via &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, with no AWS account required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-and-availability"&gt;Pricing and availability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro is currently free for all users during its preview period, including Amazon Q Developer and Q Developer Pro subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preview access includes “generous” usage limits aimed at letting developers explore Kiro without frequent disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the preview period ends, users will have a choice of three subscription tiers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Included agentic interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;50 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Specs, hooks, steering and MCP support included&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,000 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;All features from Free, plus higher usage quota&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiro Pro+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$39&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3,000 per month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Designed for heavy users or teams&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agentic interactions include any direct invocation of Kiro agents — such as initiating a spec, triggering a hook or sending a chat prompt. The subsequent processing work (like multi-step task execution) does not count toward the quota.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users on paid plans will also be able to purchase additional interactions at $0.04 each, but overage billing must be explicitly enabled.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The AI-assisted development ecosystem is becoming increasingly crowded, with several prominent IDEs and agents competing for developer attention. Here’s how Kiro stacks up:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tool&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Pricing&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amazon Q Developer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-environment AI assistant integrated into AWS, IDEs, CLI and chat. Agentic workflows via terminal or IDE. Great for cloud ops, migrations and automation. Free and Pro tiers available.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro at $19/user/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Claude Code (Anthropic)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CLI-first coding assistant with chat-based iteration, plan/edit modes and diff views. Strong for interactive code development, less structured than Kiro.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro at $17/month or $20 billed monthly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GitHub Copilot (Microsoft)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Inline code completion tool in VS Code, GitHub. Best for quick assistance. Lacks structured planning or workflow support.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free trial; Pro $10/month or $100/year; Pro+ $39/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cursor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;VS Code–based AI editor for conversational edits and navigation. Optimized for solo coding, minimal planning support.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro $20/month ($16/month yearly)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Windsurf (OpenAI, acquired)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Discontinued AI IDE focused on rapid code editing. Offered minimal planning. Key staff/IP acquired by Google and Cognition in July 2025.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free; Pro $15/month; Teams $30/user/month &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cognition / Devin&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Multi-agent system capable of autonomous software engineering from planning to deployment. Developer-in‑loop model.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Start at $20/month; older tiers at $500/month&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kiro&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Planning-first AI IDE with structured artifacts like specs, design docs and task trees; supports feature planning, implementation and QA automation. Developer‑in‑loop.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Free (50 interactions/mo); Pro: $19/user/mo (1,000 interactions); Pro+: $39/user/mo (3,000 interactions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-showcasing-kiro-in-action-nbsp-spirit-of-kiro"&gt;Showcasing Kiro in action:&amp;nbsp;‘Spirit of Kiro’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate Kiro’s capabilities in a real-world context, Amazon released a full demo project called “Spirit of Kiro”, an open-source crafting game. The project serves as a hands-on example of how Kiro can be used throughout the development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 95% of the game’s codebase was generated by prompting Kiro. The game features unique, procedurally generated items with customizable properties like damage, quirks and enchantments. Players can combine, break down and sell items — providing a complex system that highlights Kiro’s strengths in managing interconnected components and evolving feature sets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The repo includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture documentation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;App security overviews;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A deliberately incomplete sample branch with bugs (for testing spec workflows);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A roadmap with feature ideas for future contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project is also intended as a learning resource. Files like CHALLENGE.md, architecture.md and guiding-principles.md are designed to walk developers through Kiro’s specs, hooks and agentic workflows in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers can clone, run or deploy the project locally or on AWS infrastructure, and open-source contributions are welcome via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developer-response-and-early-impressions"&gt;Developer response and early impressions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro’s launch generated active discussion on startup accelerator Y Combinator’s popular developer forum Hacker News, where Nathan Peck, senior developer advocate for generative AI at AWS (username NathanKP) offered technical context and responded to questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that Kiro reflects Amazon’s internal engineering practices and is designed to help developers scale from small ideas to robust, production-ready systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial community reactions were mixed, but developers were intrigued, praising the emphasis on specs, hooks and structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some compared it favorably to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, citing the improved rigor in building and documenting features. Others voiced concern over tool churn and switching costs, while some preferred command line interface (CLI)-based tools or simpler interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feedback also surfaced around authentication bugs, platform compatibility and desire for dev container support. These early responses reflect both curiosity and the high expectations developers now have for AI coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kiro enters a crowded field but appears to carve out a niche with its structured, spec-first philosophy and support for developer-in-the-loop workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not trying to replace developers or automate entire codebases blindly. Instead, it’s offering a more disciplined way to collaborate with AI from planning to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its preview now open and pricing models outlined, Kiro may appeal most to teams and individuals looking to build not just faster, but more thoughtfully — with long-term maintainability, clarity and quality built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sources told The Times that Meta had completed training on Behemoth, but delayed its release due to underwhelming internal performance. When the new Superintelligence Lab launched, testing on the model reportedly halted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The discussions are just that — discussions. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg would still need to sign off on any changes, and a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Meta’s position on open source AI is “unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to continue releasing leading open source models,” the spokesperson said. “We haven’t released everything we’ve developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The spokesperson did not comment on Meta’s potential shift away from Behemoth. If that happens so that Meta can prioritize closed-source models, it would mark a major philosophical change for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Meta deploys more advanced closed-source models internally, like those powering its Meta AI assistant, Zuckerberg had made open source a central part of the company’s external AI strategy — a way to keep AI development moving faster. He loudly positioned the Llama family’s openness as a differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, which Zuckerberg publicly criticized for becoming more closed after partnering with Microsoft. But Meta is under pressure to monetize beyond ads as it pours billions into AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That includes paying massive signing bonuses and nine-figure salaries to poach top researchers, building out new data centers, and covering the enormous costs of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), or “superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite having one of the top AI research labs in the world, Meta still lags behind rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI when it comes to commercializing its AI work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Meta prioritizes closed models, it could suggest that openness was a strategic play, not an ideological one. Past comments from Zuckerberg hint at an ambivalence toward committing to open sourcing Meta’s models. On a podcast last summer, he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’re obviously very pro&amp;nbsp;open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do. I’m basically very inclined to think that open sourcing is going to be good for the community and also good for us because we’ll benefit from the innovations.&amp;nbsp;If at some point, however, there’s some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it’s not responsible to open source it, then we won’t. It’s all very difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Closed models would give Meta more control and more ways to monetize — especially if it believes the talent it has acquired can deliver competitive, best-in-class performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such a shift could also reshape the AI landscape. Open source momentum, largely driven by Meta and models like Llama, could slow, even as OpenAI gears up to release its still-delayed open model. Power could swing back toward the major players with closed ecosystems, while open source development might remain a product of grassroots efforts. The ripple effects would continue across the startup ecosystem, especially for smaller companies focused on fine-turning, safety, and model alignment that rely on access to open foundation models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the world stage, Meta’s retreat from open source could potentially cede ground to China, which has embraced open source AI — like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI — as a way to build domestic capability and global influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195497483.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Top members of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab discussed pivoting away from the company’s powerful open source AI model, Behemoth, and instead developing a closed model, reports The New York Times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the U.S. capital, Huang met with President Trump and U.S. policymakers, reaffirming &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA’s support for the Administration’s effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Beijing, Huang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;met with government and industry officials to discuss how AI will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;raise productivity and expand opportunity. The discussions underscored how researchers worldwide can advance safe and secure AI for the benefit of all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Huang also provided an update to customers, noting that NVIDIA is filing applications to sell the NVIDIA H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon. Finally, Huang announced a new, fully compliant NVIDIA RTX PRO GPU that “is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Huang noted during his visits, the world has reached an inflection point — AI has become a fundamental resource, like energy, water and the internet. Jensen emphasized NVIDIA’s commitment to support open-source research, foundation models and applications, which democratize AI and will empower emerging economies in every region, including Latin America, Europe, Asia and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation,” Huang explained to reporters in D.C. “We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the U.S. capital, Huang met with President Trump and U.S. policymakers, reaffirming &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA’s support for the Administration’s effort to create jobs, strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and onshore manufacturing, and ensure that America leads in AI worldwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Beijing, Huang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;met with government and industry officials to discuss how AI will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;raise productivity and expand opportunity. The discussions underscored how researchers worldwide can advance safe and secure AI for the benefit of all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Huang also provided an update to customers, noting that NVIDIA is filing applications to sell the NVIDIA H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon. Finally, Huang announced a new, fully compliant NVIDIA RTX PRO GPU that “is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company expects to receive U.S. government licenses soon and begin deliveries shortly after, according to a blog post. Nvidia is also introducing a new “RTX Pro” chip designed specifically for the Chinese market, calling it “fully compliant” with regulations and ideal for digital manufacturing applications like smart factories and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The H20 chip sits at the center of a broader U.S.-China tech standoff. While not Nvidia’s most advanced AI processor, the H20 is the most powerful chip the company can legally sell to China under existing export controls. It’s specifically designed for “inference” tasks — running existing AI models for day-to-day applications — rather than training new AI systems from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chinese tech giants including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent had been aggressively stockpiling these chips in the first three months of this year in anticipation of stricter export controls. The chip’s appeal lies partly in its superior memory bandwidth compared to Chinese alternatives, along with Nvidia’s widely-adopted software ecosystem that makes the hardware easier to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The regulatory back-and-forth began in April when the Trump administration restricted H20 sales, potentially costing Nvidia $15 billion to $16 billion in revenue, judging by how much Chinese firms reportedly splashed out for them in the first quarter alone. The move targeted chips exceeding specific performance thresholds, including total memory bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the restrictions were fairly short-lived. Soon after CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-per-head dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in early April, the administration paused the ban. According to NPR, the White House changed its mind after Nvidia promised new U.S. data center investments. Within a week of NPR’s report being published, Nvidia announced plans to build AI servers in the U.S. worth as much as $500 billion over the next four years, with help from partners such as TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The flip-flopping has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers who argue it undermines the country’s efforts to limit China’s AI capabilities and who point to DeepSeek to underscore why it matters. The Chinese startup took the AI world by storm earlier this year by building an impressive model using Nvidia’s H800 chips, which are slightly more powerful predecessors to the H20. (The U.S. banned the sale of those H800 chips back in October 2023, but Chinese suppliers have managed to figure out workarounds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement sent to TechCrunch, Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez said Huang has been meeting with officials in Washington and Beijing this month and “emphasizing the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the meantime, the whole episode underscores the ongoing balancing act that U.S. policymakers are attempting, with concerns about national security concerns running up against powerful commercial interests.

The company has been poaching AI researchers, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta is building a 5-gigawatt data center called Hyperion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The urgency is palpable. As SemiAnalysis reported last week and Business Insider noted, Meta is so eager to boost its computing power that it’s literally erecting tents for temporary data center capacity while its facilities are still under construction. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These are all signs that Meta wants to build up its AI capacity faster after falling behind competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google — and that Zuckerberg isn’t willing to wait for typical construction timelines to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This design isn’t about beauty or redundancy. It’s about getting compute online fast!” SemiAnalysis said in its report. “From prefabricated power and cooling modules to ultra-light structures, speed is of the essence as there is no backup generation (ie, no diesel generators in sight),” it added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for its Hyperion data center, Meta spokesperson Ashley Gabriel tells TechCrunch that it will be located in Louisiana and will likely have a capacity of 2 gigawatts by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
