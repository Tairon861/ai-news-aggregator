AI is now changing this, enabling teams to accelerate decision-making, enhance margins, and improve project outcomes. According to new research from Dodge Construction Network (Dodge) and CMiC, the true transformative impact of AI is highlighted by contractors, with 87% believing AI will “meaningfully transform their business,” despite current low adoption rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research, entitled, ‘AI for Contractors,’ discovered automated proposal generation and progress tracking from site photos both reached a 92% effectiveness rating. Meanwhile, contract risk review achieved 85% effectiveness when compared to previous, more traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report highlights how AI is allowing project managers to focus on strategic decisions rather than time-consuming administrative tasks. Finance teams are also benefiting from AI technology, shifting from historical reporting to predictive insights, while operations leaders are able to apply data-driven intelligence for improved project delivery. Rather than AI fully replacing human expertise, the report found it actually enhances human input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, construction firms have lacked the tools to transform the data they’ve collected into action. AI-enabled solutions are changing that,” says Gord Rawlins, president and CEO of CMiC. “This research highlights the high-impact results contractors are achieving today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI changing contractor roles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveyed contractors see AI as a catalyst in reshaping everyday aspects of their operations, enabling predictive insights rather than reacting to problems once they have occurred. This introduces wider benefits, like tighter cost controls, improved scheduling, and higher quality project delivery. In other words, improved overall outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial 85% of contractors foresee less time spent on repetitive tasks, while 75% have faith that AI can help mine historical data to learn from previous projects. Rather than relying fully on AI, 70% said the technology helps them make better, more informed decisions thanks to insights that may otherwise not be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI implementation remains low, but companies are preparing for wider adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, AI adoption in the construction industry is low, despite awareness levels of 32% to 34%. This seems to be due to several reasons, including a lack of clear understanding, internal approvals, and software access. However, Dodge’s research discovered more than half of companies surveyed are strategically preparing for AI with pilot programmes and staff training for AI-related positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, 40% of companies have a set budget for AI, 38% are developing teams for implementation, 19% are adapting old workflows, and 51% are assessing AI changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early adopters lead the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall awareness of AI use in the industry is quite low, with just 20% to 50% of contractors knowing that certain management tasks implement AI, and very few actively use these functions. Nevertheless, early adopters of AI provided positive feedback, as more than 70% revealed that AI tools are hugely effective compared to more traditional methods, suggesting a potential for quick growth in AI use throughout the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and accuracy lead concerns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main concerns of adopting AI revolve around security and accuracy. The report reveals that 57% are worried about the accuracy of AI output, while 54% have doubts over the security of company data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal resistance to change (44%) and implementation costs (41%) are also cited as key concerns, but perhaps surprisingly, just 21% expressed concern over job losses. 31% believe current data quality is not yet adequate to support AI analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, larger contractors are likely to rely more on AI than smaller firms, thus are more concerned about data quality and reliability. For instance, 69% of larger contractors cited lack of reliability or accuracy of AI outputs as a major concern, compared to 54% of smaller or mid-size contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research data confirms that contractors are generally open to adopting AI, but the accuracy of AI outputs tend to stand in the way, as well as the desire for better tools, more information, and greater internal support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17% of contractors said they do not sufficiently trust AI results, an issue that becomes more pronounced in sensitive areas like payments. Distrust in AI operations rises to 35% and 31% not having faith in AI managing project budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major theme is the need for more understanding before using AI. On average, 21% of respondents said they want a better insight of how AI works before considering using it, climbing to 31% for more complex tasks like safety risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contractors also believe they are limited by their current software capabilities, with an average of 19% reporting their software does not offer the AI functions they require. The increases to 33% for managing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal approval remains a notable obstacle, with 22% saying their company has not yet approved the use of AI, despite personal interest. Another barrier is a lack of time or resources that effectively evaluate AI tools. 13% stated this as a main reason why AI has not yet been adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are obvious challenges to mass AI use in the construction industry – and therefore significant market opportunity – only 5% believe AI would not be beneficial or improve current methods. That indicates a resistance that stems from various concerns rather than a lack of perceived value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jones, Senior Director, Industry Insights Analytics at Dodge, spoke on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We designed this study to look at the use of AI in the digital tools already deployed by contractors because that may offer the best solution to the challenge of data quality. But it is also heartening to see that many contractors are aware of the key challenges and the need for a rigorous approach to successfully implementing these tools at their organisations,” the Dodge research states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key interest in emerging AI functionalities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s potential is clearly recognised, even if the industry’s readiness to adopt it isn’t quite matching the data. Certain areas are attracting the most attention when it comes to AI functions, like automated construction analysis, where 81% see potential benefits. 80% also show interest in intelligent permit submissions, while 79% believe in autonomous schedule and resource optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;92% appreciate automated contract management and 76% recognise potential in AI-powered dynamic pricing. Although AI adoption remains limited, these strong numbers suggest the tide may soon be turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI and the new age of the construction industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data suggests a strong openness, maybe even an eagerness, to AI adoption in the construction sector. However, better tools, clearer guidance, and more trustworthy outputs are just some of the areas that need to be addressed before interest becomes implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With high awareness, strong interest, and powerful validation from early adopters, contractors appear poised for significant expansion in their use of AI-enabled tools in meaningful ways,” said Steve Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is on a “tipping point for AI adoption” according to Jones. When companies start to provide clearer pathways for adoption, the move towards AI-powered construction workflows will undoubtedly accelerate rapidly, reshaping how projects are delivered forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Tianjin Construction Site.” by @yakobusan Jakob Montrasio is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This is redefining roles and expectations, while workloads continue to increase and pressure intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the employment landscape transforms, it has become clear that the future of work and talent will be defined by three main areas – continuous education, greater flexibility, and AI literacy. This is according to new research conducted by The Harris Poll, who discovered that employers who invest heavily in educational benefits and AI development gain key advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priya Krishnan, Chief Transformation Officer, Bright Horizons, said, “AI is rewriting job descriptions fast… employers who invest in education benefits and AI training now will build resilient, innovative teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI skills demand heightens with workloads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 2025 EdAssist by Bright Horizons Education Index, 42% of US employees are expecting AI to significantly change their role over the next year, despite only 17% actively using AI on a frequent basis. However, the report revealed that the increased adoption of AI is not the key talking point – it’s the urgent skills mandate AI has triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers now feel they have to evolve to remain competitive, with 32% feeling increased pressure to learn new skills because of AI, an increase from 26% in 2024. The demand for upskilling comes as workforce stress hits new heights. For instance, 81% of employees report being pushed to take on greater workloads, and 80% stated they are expected to deliver work faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI has the ability to reduce some of this strain, but without proper guidance and training, employees will struggle to use it effectively. The report found that the adoption of AI technology rises to 76% when employers provide AI training, while workers who have access to training (84%) reported feeling more prepared for potential changes than those without (48%). Essentially, effective training turns uncertainty into confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, 34% of those surveyed said they feel unprepared for changes driven by AI, and 42% said their employers expected them to develop their understanding of AI alone, without any formal training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is rewriting job descriptions faster than most organisations can keep up,” said Priya Krishnan, Chief Transformation Officer at Bright Horizons. “Employers who act now will not only close important skill gaps but also build a culture of resilience and innovation. This is not about chasing trends but creating a workforce that thrives in a world where technology and human capability advance together. Education benefits, flexible learning, and AI literacy are the foundation for long-term competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Education benefits drive retention and readiness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EdIndex highlights how investing in employee education can pay off, both for employees and employers. However, challenges are still present, with a key concern being financial barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, the skills gap is not simply about technology, it’s about “access and affordability.” 48% of employees surveyed said they avoid further education, citing the “fear of student debt” as the main reason. 34% reported that they cannot afford any more student loan debt, therefore curtailing any career advancement and blocking opportunities. The underscores the need for affordable, employer-sponsored learning programmes that allow employees the chance to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees highly value education support, with 85% reporting that they would be more loyal to employers that invest in continuing education. 86% said they would choose a job that offers such opportunities over one that doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;82% believe employer support for learning is crucial, while 29% aid it is essential for their job. In addition, 74% said they would be more loyal to an employer if they helped pay off their student loans, further emphasising how the alleviation of financial obstacles drives loyalty and retention, as well as ROI for employers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half (55%) of respondents are more likely to remain with a company if AI training or certification is available, and 76% actively use AI when training has been provided, compared to only 25% without formal training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2026 predictions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to 2026, the report highlights five key shifts and how employers can start preparing now. First, the report predicts AI literacy will become essential in the workplace as automation affects almost all jobs. Therefore, companies need to develop AI training programmes and ongoing support that enable employees to feel confident when using new tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, upskilling is set to give employers and employees a significant competitive advantage. Organisations that invest heavily in both technical and soft skills will be better equipped for innovation and adaption going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, flexible education benefits will be key to ensuring employee retention. Workers are increasingly seeking employers who provide financial support and remove financial barriers that limit their learning, so those who offer certain “perks,” like debt-free programmes and tuition support will be more likely to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth major prediction is how continuous learning will become a key component of workplace environments. With roles evolving, the report says employers must set clear career pathways with personalised learning plans that help their employees grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, work-life balance is expected to play a huge role. Companies that blend education benefits with flexibility and well-being support that reduces stress have a higher chance of maintaining a loyal workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pressure remains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although career satisfaction appears high at 87%, workers are under continuing pressure, with 78% feeling pushed to perform tasks outside their main role. As a result, priorities are shifting quickly. While earning a raise remains an important factor with 57% naming it a key priority, work-life balance (43%) and stress reduction (35%) are surging, rising sharply from 2024’s numbers of 35% and 29% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 90% say they feel somewhat prepared as their job role evolves, this confidence drops when AI is brought into the equation, as just 66% feel ready for AI’s certain impact. AI may be easing some areas of work, but its presence is also rising workplace pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 EdAssist report suggests, “The employers who act now by embedding skill development opportunities, AI training, short-form learning, and debt-conscious benefits into their talent strategy will future-proof their business and avoid being left behind as the competition for skills intensifies.” Only when employers take these steps can they build a workforce capable of sustaining long-term growth and navigating the changes that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “HMS St Albans’ Ship’s Company conduct a training day in the Plymouth exercise areas” by Royal Navy Media Archive is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

AI may be easing some areas of work, but its presence is also rising workplace pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 EdAssist report suggests, “The employers who act now by embedding skill development opportunities, AI training, short-form learning, and debt-conscious benefits into their talent strategy will future-proof their business and avoid being left behind as the competition for skills intensifies.” Only when employers take these steps can they build a workforce capable of sustaining long-term growth and navigating the changes that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “HMS St Albans’ Ship’s Company conduct a training day in the Plymouth exercise areas” by Royal Navy Media Archive is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But another approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it’s difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK’s Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation &amp;amp; Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“If you’re guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you’re in an airliner, that’s definitely not good enough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle’s bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it’s traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they’re measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129375" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_Tiqker-Atomic-Clock-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A view of Infleqtion's atomic clock Tiqker. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY INFLEQTION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond’s location, making it possible to infer where it’s situated on the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicate systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors’ functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there’s 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane’s location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its "software-ruggedized" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infleqtion's atomic clock named Tiqker." class="wp-image-1129376" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251211_q-ctrl_ironstoneopal-embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An illustration showing the placement of Q-CTRL's Ironstone Opal in a drone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY Q-CTRL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensor fusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX’s internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,”&amp;nbsp;says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it’s an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it’s stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country’s defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it’s stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1129887/quantum-navigation-militarys-gps-jamming-problem/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>JPMorgan Chase AI strategy: US$18B bet paying off (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-ai-strategy-2025/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase’s AI strategy is delivering measurable returns – but at a human cost.

But Waldron’s candour about trust challenges, the “value gap” between capability and execution, and the multi-year journey ahead suggest that even US$18 billion and 200,000 engaged employees don’t guarantee seamless transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises evaluating their AI strategies, JPMorgan’s lesson isn’t that scale solves everything – it’s that honest assessment of both opportunities and execution risks separates genuine transformation from expensive experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether JPMorgan’s AI strategy is working.

The appeal is obvious: If you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors, including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine-tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: They’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is&amp;nbsp;currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, it should be cheaper. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Everbloom-fibers.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices.

According to &lt;em&gt;Financial News&lt;/em&gt;, the bank has rolled out an internal tool called IB Portal, designed to help bankers assemble client pitches more quickly and with less repetition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitch preparation sits at the centre of investment banking work. Teams pull together market views, deal history, and tailored narratives under tight timelines. Much of that effort repeats work that already exists elsewhere in the organisation. Slides, charts, and precedent analysis are often rebuilt from scratch, even when similar material has been used before by another team or office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IB Portal is meant to reduce that waste. The system searches BNP Paribas’s past pitch materials and uses what the bank describes as “smart prompts” to surface relevant slides, analysis, and supporting content for a new mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Holst, head of the corporate clients group at BNP Paribas, said the tool functions like an AI-powered search engine that helps bankers find what matters ahead of a pitch or client meeting. In his words, it can cut research time by days, giving teams more room to focus on strategy and client judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use case matters because it places AI inside real, constrained workflows rather than around them. Pitch decks are not generic documents. They reflect internal viewpoints, client-specific details, and regulatory requirements. Making an AI tool useful in this setting depends less on conversational flair and more on structure. That includes deciding which materials are searchable, setting clear access controls in regions and business lines, and defining how retrieved content moves from internal draft to client-ready output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, that also means traceability. Bankers need to see where information comes from, and anything produced by the system still needs human review before it leaves the firm. Without those checks, the risk of errors or inappropriate disclosure rises quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;BNP Paribas builds AI tools on internal platforms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portal also fits into a broader internal build-out at BNP Paribas. In June 2025, the bank outlined an “LLM as a Service” platform aimed at giving its business units shared access to large language models in the group’s own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform is run by internal IT teams and hosted in BNP Paribas data centres with dedicated GPU capacity. The bank said it supports a mix of models, including open-source options and systems from Mistral AI, with plans to add models trained on internal data. Intended use cases include internal assistants, document drafting, and information retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other large banks are taking a similar approach. JPMorganChase has pointed to growing use of its internal “LLM Suite”, which provides staff access to models in a controlled environment. Reuters has reported on Goldman Sachs’s investment in AI engineering and its rollout of a proprietary “GS AI Assistant”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS has discussed an internal M&amp;amp;A “co-pilot” used for idea generation. Alongside these in-house efforts, specialist tools like Rogo have found traction at firms including Nomura and Moelis, pointing to demand for finance-specific AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For BNP Paribas, the real test is whether IB Portal becomes part of everyday work rather than a one-off experiment. The potential benefits are straightforward: less time spent searching, fewer duplicated decks, and better reuse of institutional knowledge. The risks are just as familiar. Hallucinated data, unclear sources, and accidental exposure of sensitive information all carry real consequences in banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most stable deployments keep AI tightly constrained. That usually means grounding outputs in approved internal content, applying role-based access controls, recording how tools are used, and requiring human sign-off before anything reaches a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If IB Portal operates in those boundaries, it offers a practical view of how enterprise AI is taking shape: not as a source of instant answers, but as a faster and safer way to navigate what an organisation already knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Enrico Frascati)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: CEOs still betting big on AI: Strategy vs. return on investment in 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

A blog post from the company highlights the analysis of data from sensors and monitoring systems to spot patterns and flag issues for plant machinery, giving choices to decision-makers that can improve efficiency and safety – plus reduce environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business leaders at BHP, the useful question was not “Where can we use AI?” but “Which decisions do we make repeatedly, and what information would improve them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org930679b"&gt;Portfolio not showcase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP describes the end-to-end effects of AI on operations, or as it puts it, “from mineral extraction to customer delivery.” Leaders had decided to move beyond pilot rollouts, treating AI as an operational capability. It started with a small set of problems that affected the company’s performance; places where change could be measured in results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found it could avoid unplanned downtime of machinery, plus it tightened its energy and water use. Each use case addressing a small but impactful problem was given an owner and an accompanying KPI. Results were reviewed with the same regularity used for other operational performance monitoring elsewhere in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org6d6492e"&gt;Where BHP uses AI daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to BHP focusing specifically on areas such as predictive maintenance and energy optimisation, it gave consideration to using AI in more adventurous yet important operations such as autonomous vehicles and real-time staff health monitoring. Such categories can translate well to other asset-heavy environments, across logistics, manufacturing, and heavy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org060e177"&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive maintenance is the process of planning repairs in scheduled downtime to reduce unexpected failures and costly, unplanned stoppages. Here, AI models analyse equipment data from on-board sensors and can anticipate maintenance needs. This cuts breakdown numbers and reduces equipment-related safety incidents. BHP runs predictive analytics across most of its load-and-haul fleets and its materials handling systems.

A blog post from the company highlights the analysis of data from sensors and monitoring systems to spot patterns and flag issues for plant machinery, giving choices to decision-makers that can improve efficiency and safety – plus reduce environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business leaders at BHP, the useful question was not “Where can we use AI?” but “Which decisions do we make repeatedly, and what information would improve them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org930679b"&gt;Portfolio not showcase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP describes the end-to-end effects of AI on operations, or as it puts it, “from mineral extraction to customer delivery.” Leaders had decided to move beyond pilot rollouts, treating AI as an operational capability. It started with a small set of problems that affected the company’s performance; places where change could be measured in results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found it could avoid unplanned downtime of machinery, plus it tightened its energy and water use. Each use case addressing a small but impactful problem was given an owner and an accompanying KPI. Results were reviewed with the same regularity used for other operational performance monitoring elsewhere in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org6d6492e"&gt;Where BHP uses AI daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to BHP focusing specifically on areas such as predictive maintenance and energy optimisation, it gave consideration to using AI in more adventurous yet important operations such as autonomous vehicles and real-time staff health monitoring. Such categories can translate well to other asset-heavy environments, across logistics, manufacturing, and heavy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org060e177"&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive maintenance is the process of planning repairs in scheduled downtime to reduce unexpected failures and costly, unplanned stoppages. Here, AI models analyse equipment data from on-board sensors and can anticipate maintenance needs. This cuts breakdown numbers and reduces equipment-related safety incidents.

The launch is Zencoder&amp;#x27;s most ambitious attempt yet to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market dominated by tools like &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/agents"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, and coding agents built directly by AI giants &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/features/codex"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Chat UIs were fine for copilots, but they break down when you try to scale,&amp;quot; said Andrew Filev, Zencoder&amp;#x27;s chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Teams are hitting a wall where speed without structure creates technical debt. Zenflow replaces &amp;#x27;Prompt Roulette&amp;#x27; with an engineering assembly line where agents plan, implement, and, crucially, verify each other&amp;#x27;s work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement arrives at a critical moment for enterprise software development. Companies across industries have poured billions of dollars into AI coding tools over the past two years, hoping to dramatically accelerate their engineering output. Yet the promised productivity revolution has largely failed to materialize at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why AI coding tools have failed to deliver on their 10x productivity promise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filev, who previously founded and sold the project management company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/citrix-is-acquiring-wrike-from-vista-for-2-25b/"&gt;Wrike to Citrix&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to a growing disconnect between AI coding hype and reality. While vendors have promised tenfold productivity gains, rigorous studies — including research from Stanford University — consistently show improvements closer to 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you talk to real engineering leaders, I don&amp;#x27;t remember a single conversation where somebody vibe coded themselves to 2x or 5x or 10x productivity on serious engineering production,&amp;quot; Filev said. &amp;quot;The typical number you would hear would be about 20 percent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, according to Filev, lies not with the AI models themselves but with how developers interact with them. The standard approach of typing requests into a chat interface and hoping for usable code works well for simple tasks but falls apart on complex enterprise projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zencoder&amp;#x27;s internal engineering team claims to have cracked a different approach. Filev said the company now operates at roughly twice the velocity it achieved 12 months ago, not primarily because AI models improved, but because the team restructured its development processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had to change our process and use a variety of different best practices,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the four pillars that power Zencoder&amp;#x27;s AI orchestration platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenflow organizes its approach around four core capabilities that Zencoder argues any serious AI orchestration platform must support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structured workflows&lt;/b&gt; replace ad-hoc prompting with repeatable sequences (plan, implement, test, review) that agents follow consistently. Filev drew parallels to his experience building Wrike, noting that individual to-do lists rarely scale across organizations, while defined workflows create predictable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spec-driven development&lt;/b&gt; requires AI agents to first generate a technical specification, then create a step-by-step plan, and only then write code. The approach became so effective that frontier AI labs including Anthropic and OpenAI have since trained their models to follow it automatically. The specification anchors agents to clear requirements, preventing what Zencoder calls &amp;quot;iteration drift,&amp;quot; or the tendency for AI-generated code to gradually diverge from the original intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-agent verification&lt;/b&gt; deploys different AI models to critique each other&amp;#x27;s work. Because AI models from the same family tend to share blind spots, Zencoder routes verification tasks across model providers, asking Claude to review code written by OpenAI&amp;#x27;s models, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Think of it as a second opinion from a doctor,&amp;quot; Filev told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;With the right pipeline, we see results on par with what you&amp;#x27;d expect from Claude 5 or GPT-6. You&amp;#x27;re getting the benefit of a next-generation model today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallel execution&lt;/b&gt; lets developers run multiple AI agents simultaneously in isolated sandboxes, preventing them from interfering with each other&amp;#x27;s work. The interface provides a command center for monitoring this fleet, a significant departure from the current practice of managing multiple terminal windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How verification solves AI coding&amp;#x27;s biggest reliability problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zencoder&amp;#x27;s emphasis on verification addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of AI-generated code: its tendency to produce &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/merriam-webster-declares-slop-word-of-the-year-nod-to-growth-of-ai.html"&gt;slop&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; or code that appears correct but fails in production or degrades over successive iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s internal research found that developers who skip verification often fall into what Filev called a &amp;quot;death loop.&amp;quot; An AI agent completes a task successfully, but the developer, reluctant to review unfamiliar code, moves on without understanding what was written. When subsequent tasks fail, the developer lacks the context to fix problems manually and instead keeps prompting the AI for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They literally spend more than a day in that death loop,&amp;quot; Filev said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s why the productivity is not 2x, because they were running at 3x first, and then they wasted the whole day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;multi-agent verification&lt;/a&gt; approach also gives Zencoder an unusual competitive advantage over the frontier AI labs themselves. While Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google each optimize their own models, Zencoder can mix and match across providers to reduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is a rare situation where we have an edge on the frontier labs,&amp;quot; Filev said. &amp;quot;Most of the time they have an edge on us, but this is a rare case.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zencoder faces steep competition from AI giants and well-funded startups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt; enters the AI orchestration market at a moment of intense competition. The company has positioned itself as a model-agnostic platform, supporting major providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. In September, Zencoder expanded its platform to let developers use command-line coding agents from any provider within its interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy reflects a pragmatic acknowledgment that developers increasingly maintain relationships with multiple AI providers rather than committing exclusively to one. Zencoder&amp;#x27;s universal platform approach lets it serve as the orchestration layer regardless of which underlying models a company prefers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also emphasizes enterprise readiness, touting &lt;a href="https://secureframe.com/blog/soc-2-type-ii"&gt;SOC 2 Type II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001"&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/42001"&gt;ISO 42001&lt;/a&gt; certifications along with GDPR compliance. These credentials matter for regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where compliance requirements can block adoption of consumer-oriented AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt; faces formidable competition from multiple directions. &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://windsurf.com/"&gt;Windsurf&lt;/a&gt; have built dedicated AI-first code editors with devoted user bases. &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt; benefits from Microsoft&amp;#x27;s distribution muscle and deep integration with the world&amp;#x27;s largest code repository. And the frontier AI labs continue expanding their own coding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filev dismissed concerns about competition from the AI labs, arguing that smaller players like Zencoder can move faster on user experience innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m sure they will come to the same conclusion, and they&amp;#x27;re smart and moving fast, so I&amp;#x27;m sure they will catch up fairly quickly,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s why I said in the next six to 12 months, you&amp;#x27;re going to see a lot of this propagating through the whole space.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The case for adopting AI orchestration now instead of waiting for better models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical executives weighing AI coding investments face a difficult timing question: Should they adopt orchestration tools now, or wait for frontier AI labs to build these capabilities natively into their models?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filev argued that waiting carries significant competitive risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right now, everybody is under pressure to deliver more in less time, and everybody expects engineering leaders to deliver results from AI,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;As a founder and CEO, I do not expect 20 percent from my VP of engineering. I expect 2x.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also questioned whether the major AI labs will prioritize orchestration capabilities when their core business remains model development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the ideal world, frontier labs should be building the best-ever models and competing with each other, and Zencoders and Cursors need to build the best-ever UI and UX application layer on top of those models,&amp;quot; Filev said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t see a world where OpenAI will offer you our code verifier, or vice versa.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenflow launches as a &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;free desktop application&lt;/a&gt;, with updated plugins available for &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; integrated development environments. The product supports what Zencoder calls &amp;quot;dynamic workflows,&amp;quot; meaning the system automatically adjusts process complexity based on whether a human is actively monitoring and on the difficulty of the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zencoder said internal testing showed that replacing standard prompting with Zenflow&amp;#x27;s orchestration layer improved code correctness by approximately 20 percent on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Zencoder&amp;#x27;s bet on orchestration reveals about the future of AI coding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt; frames &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;Zenflow&lt;/a&gt; as the first product in what it expects to become a significant new software category. The company believes every vendor focused on AI coding will eventually arrive at similar conclusions about the need for orchestration tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think the next six to 12 months will be all about orchestration,&amp;quot; Filev predicted. &amp;quot;A lot of organizations will finally reach that 2x. Not 10x yet, but at least the 2x they were promised a year ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than competing head-to-head with frontier AI labs on model quality, Zencoder is betting that the application layer (the software that helps developers actually use these models effectively) will determine winners and losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, Filev suggested, a familiar pattern from technology history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is very similar to what I observed when I started Wrike,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;As work went digital, people relied on email and spreadsheets to manage everything, and neither could keep up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same dynamic, he argued, now applies to AI coding. Chat interfaces were designed for conversation, not for orchestrating complex engineering workflows. Whether Zencoder can establish itself as the essential layer between developers and AI models before the giants build their own solutions remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Filev seems comfortable with the race. The last time he spotted a gap between how people worked and the tools they had to work with, he built a company worth over a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenflow is available immediately as a free download at &lt;a href="http://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;zencoder.ai/zenflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt;, the Silicon Valley startup that builds AI-powered coding agents, released a free desktop application on Monday that it says will fundamentally change how software engineers interact with artificial intelligence — moving the industry beyond the freewheeling era of &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; toward a more disciplined, verifiable approach to AI-assisted development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product, called &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;Zenflow&lt;/a&gt;, introduces what the company describes as an &amp;quot;AI orchestration layer&amp;quot; that coordinates multiple AI agents to plan, implement, test, and review code in structured workflows.

These credentials matter for regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where compliance requirements can block adoption of consumer-oriented AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt; faces formidable competition from multiple directions. &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://windsurf.com/"&gt;Windsurf&lt;/a&gt; have built dedicated AI-first code editors with devoted user bases. &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt; benefits from Microsoft&amp;#x27;s distribution muscle and deep integration with the world&amp;#x27;s largest code repository. And the frontier AI labs continue expanding their own coding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filev dismissed concerns about competition from the AI labs, arguing that smaller players like Zencoder can move faster on user experience innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m sure they will come to the same conclusion, and they&amp;#x27;re smart and moving fast, so I&amp;#x27;m sure they will catch up fairly quickly,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s why I said in the next six to 12 months, you&amp;#x27;re going to see a lot of this propagating through the whole space.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The case for adopting AI orchestration now instead of waiting for better models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical executives weighing AI coding investments face a difficult timing question: Should they adopt orchestration tools now, or wait for frontier AI labs to build these capabilities natively into their models?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filev argued that waiting carries significant competitive risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right now, everybody is under pressure to deliver more in less time, and everybody expects engineering leaders to deliver results from AI,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;As a founder and CEO, I do not expect 20 percent from my VP of engineering. I expect 2x.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also questioned whether the major AI labs will prioritize orchestration capabilities when their core business remains model development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the ideal world, frontier labs should be building the best-ever models and competing with each other, and Zencoders and Cursors need to build the best-ever UI and UX application layer on top of those models,&amp;quot; Filev said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t see a world where OpenAI will offer you our code verifier, or vice versa.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenflow launches as a &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;free desktop application&lt;/a&gt;, with updated plugins available for &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; integrated development environments. The product supports what Zencoder calls &amp;quot;dynamic workflows,&amp;quot; meaning the system automatically adjusts process complexity based on whether a human is actively monitoring and on the difficulty of the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zencoder said internal testing showed that replacing standard prompting with Zenflow&amp;#x27;s orchestration layer improved code correctness by approximately 20 percent on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Zencoder&amp;#x27;s bet on orchestration reveals about the future of AI coding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/"&gt;Zencoder&lt;/a&gt; frames &lt;a href="https://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;Zenflow&lt;/a&gt; as the first product in what it expects to become a significant new software category. The company believes every vendor focused on AI coding will eventually arrive at similar conclusions about the need for orchestration tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think the next six to 12 months will be all about orchestration,&amp;quot; Filev predicted. &amp;quot;A lot of organizations will finally reach that 2x. Not 10x yet, but at least the 2x they were promised a year ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than competing head-to-head with frontier AI labs on model quality, Zencoder is betting that the application layer (the software that helps developers actually use these models effectively) will determine winners and losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, Filev suggested, a familiar pattern from technology history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is very similar to what I observed when I started Wrike,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;As work went digital, people relied on email and spreadsheets to manage everything, and neither could keep up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same dynamic, he argued, now applies to AI coding. Chat interfaces were designed for conversation, not for orchestrating complex engineering workflows. Whether Zencoder can establish itself as the essential layer between developers and AI models before the giants build their own solutions remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Filev seems comfortable with the race. The last time he spotted a gap between how people worked and the tools they had to work with, he built a company worth over a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zenflow is available immediately as a free download at &lt;a href="http://zencoder.ai/zenflow"&gt;zencoder.ai/zenflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/zencoder-drops-zenflow-a-free-ai-orchestration-tool-that-pits-claude-against</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Zoom says it aced AI’s hardest exam.

That result edges out Google&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/"&gt;Gemini 3 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which held the previous record at 45.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zoom has achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Humanity&amp;#x27;s Last Exam full-set benchmark, scoring 48.1%, which represents a substantial 2.3% improvement over the previous SOTA result,&amp;quot; wrote Xuedong Huang, Zoom&amp;#x27;s chief technology officer, in a &lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough"&gt;blog pos&lt;/a&gt;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement raises a provocative question that has consumed AI watchers for days: How did a video conferencing company — one with no public history of training large language models — suddenly vault past &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?zx=1765849295623&amp;amp;no_sw_cr=1"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; on a benchmark built to measure the frontiers of machine intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer reveals as much about where AI is headed as it does about Zoom&amp;#x27;s own technical ambitions. And depending on whom you ask, it&amp;#x27;s either an ingenious demonstration of practical engineering or a hollow claim that appropriates credit for others&amp;#x27; work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Zoom built an AI traffic controller instead of training its own model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom did not train its own large language model. Instead, the company developed what it calls a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough"&gt;federated AI approach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — a system that routes queries to multiple existing models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, then uses proprietary software to select, combine, and refine their outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this system sits what Zoom calls its &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/federated-ai-approach-best-quality-for-most-popular-features/"&gt;Z-scorer&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; a mechanism that evaluates responses from different models and chooses the best one for any given task. The company pairs this with what it describes as an &amp;quot;explore-verify-federate strategy,&amp;quot; an agentic workflow that balances exploratory reasoning with verification across multiple AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our federated approach combines Zoom&amp;#x27;s own small language models with advanced open-source and closed-source models,&amp;quot; Huang wrote. The framework &amp;quot;orchestrates diverse models to generate, challenge, and refine reasoning through dialectical collaboration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Zoom built a sophisticated traffic controller for AI, not the AI itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction matters enormously in an industry where bragging rights — and billions in valuation — often hinge on who can claim the most capable model. The major AI laboratories spend hundreds of millions of dollars training frontier systems on vast computing clusters. Zoom&amp;#x27;s achievement, by contrast, appears to rest on clever integration of those existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why AI researchers are divided over what counts as real innovation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from the AI community was swift and sharply divided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/maxrumpf"&gt;Max Rumpf&lt;/a&gt;, an AI engineer who says he has trained state-of-the-art language models, posted a pointed critique on social media. &amp;quot;Zoom strung together API calls to Gemini, GPT, Claude et al. and slightly improved on a benchmark that delivers no value for their customers,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;They then claim SOTA.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumpf did not dismiss the technical approach itself. Using multiple models for different tasks, he noted, is &amp;quot;actually quite smart and most applications should do this.&amp;quot; He pointed to Sierra, an AI customer service company, as an example of this multi-model strategy executed effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His objection was more specific: &amp;quot;They did not train the model, but obfuscate this fact in the tweet. The injustice of taking credit for the work of others sits deeply with people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other observers saw the achievement differently. &lt;a href="https://x.com/hzhu_/status/1999930478946820539"&gt;Hongcheng Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, a developer, offered a more measured assessment: &amp;quot;To top an AI eval, you will most likely need model federation, like what Zoom did. An analogy is that every Kaggle competitor knows you have to ensemble models to win a contest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison to &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; — the competitive data science platform where combining multiple models is standard practice among winning teams — reframes Zoom&amp;#x27;s approach as industry best practice rather than sleight of hand. Academic research has long established that ensemble methods routinely outperform individual models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the debate exposed a fault line in how the industry understands progress. &lt;a href="https://x.com/AIMachineDream"&gt;Ryan Pream&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Exoria AI, was dismissive: &amp;quot;Zoom are just creating a harness around another LLM and reporting that. It is just noise.&amp;quot; Another commenter captured the sheer unexpectedness of the news: &amp;quot;That the video conferencing app ZOOM developed a SOTA model that achieved 48% HLE was not on my bingo card.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most pointed critique concerned priorities. Rumpf argued that Zoom could have directed its resources toward problems its customers actually face. &amp;quot;Retrieval over call transcripts is not &amp;#x27;solved&amp;#x27; by SOTA LLMs,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;I figure Zoom&amp;#x27;s users would care about this much more than HLE.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Microsoft veteran betting his reputation on a different kind of AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Zoom&amp;#x27;s benchmark result seemed to come from nowhere, its chief technology officer did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xuedong Huang &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/inside-zooms-ai-evolution-from-basic-meeting-tools-to-agentic-productivity-platform-powered-by-llms-and-slms"&gt;joined Zoom from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent decades building the company&amp;#x27;s AI capabilities. He founded Microsoft&amp;#x27;s speech technology group in 1993 and led teams that achieved what the company described as human parity in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding, and computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huang holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He is an elected member of the &lt;a href="https://www.nae.edu/"&gt;National Academy of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/person/xuedong-huang"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a fellow of both the &lt;a href="https://www.ieee.org/"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.acm.org/"&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;. His credentials place him among the most accomplished AI executives in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His presence at Zoom signals that the company&amp;#x27;s AI ambitions are serious, even if its methods differ from the research laboratories that dominate headlines. In his tweet celebrating the benchmark result, Huang framed the achievement as validation of Zoom&amp;#x27;s strategy: &amp;quot;We have unlocked stronger capabilities in exploration, reasoning, and multi-model collaboration, surpassing the performance limits of any single model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That final clause — &amp;quot;surpassing the performance limits of any single model&amp;quot; — may be the most significant. Huang is not claiming Zoom built a better model. He is claiming Zoom built a better system for using models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the test designed to stump the world&amp;#x27;s smartest machines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark at the center of this controversy, &lt;a href="https://agi.safe.ai/"&gt;Humanity&amp;#x27;s Last Exam&lt;/a&gt;, was designed to be exceptionally difficult. Unlike earlier tests that AI systems learned to game through pattern matching, HLE presents problems that require genuine understanding, multi-step reasoning, and the synthesis of information across complex domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam draws on questions from experts around the world, spanning fields from advanced mathematics to philosophy to specialized scientific knowledge. A score of 48.1 percent might sound unimpressive to anyone accustomed to school grading curves, but in the context of HLE, it represents the current ceiling of machine performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This benchmark was developed by subject-matter experts globally and has become a crucial metric for measuring AI&amp;#x27;s progress toward human-level performance on challenging intellectual tasks,&amp;quot; &lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/federated-ai-approach-best-quality-for-most-popular-features/"&gt;Zoom’s announcement noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s improvement of 2.3 percentage points over Google&amp;#x27;s previous best may appear modest in isolation. But in competitive benchmarking, where gains often come in fractions of a percent, such a jump commands attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Zoom&amp;#x27;s approach reveals about the future of enterprise AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom&amp;#x27;s approach carries implications that extend well beyond benchmark leaderboards. The company is signaling a vision for enterprise AI that differs fundamentally from the model-centric strategies pursued by &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than betting everything on building the single most capable model, Zoom is positioning itself as an orchestration layer — a company that can integrate the best capabilities from multiple providers and deliver them through products that businesses already use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy hedges against a critical uncertainty in the AI market: no one knows which model will be best next month, let alone next year. By building infrastructure that can swap between providers, Zoom avoids vendor lock-in while theoretically offering customers the best available AI for any given task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/"&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s GPT-5.2&lt;/a&gt; the following day underscored this dynamic. OpenAI&amp;#x27;s own communications named Zoom as a partner that had evaluated the new model&amp;#x27;s performance &amp;quot;across their AI workloads and saw measurable gains across the board.&amp;quot; Zoom, in other words, is both a customer of the frontier labs and now a competitor on their benchmarks — using their own technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This arrangement may prove sustainable. The major model providers have every incentive to sell API access widely, even to companies that might aggregate their outputs. The more interesting question is whether Zoom&amp;#x27;s orchestration capabilities constitute genuine intellectual property or merely sophisticated prompt engineering that others could replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real test arrives when Zoom&amp;#x27;s 300 million users start asking questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom titled its announcement section on industry relations &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/"&gt;A Collaborative Future&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; and Huang struck notes of gratitude throughout. &amp;quot;The future of AI is collaborative, not competitive,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;By combining the best innovations from across the industry with our own research breakthroughs, we create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framing positions Zoom as a beneficent integrator, bringing together the industry&amp;#x27;s best work for the benefit of enterprise customers. Critics see something else: a company claiming the prestige of an AI laboratory without doing the foundational research that earns it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate will likely be settled not by leaderboards but by products. When &lt;a href="https://news.zoom.com/zoom-launches-ai-companion-3-0/"&gt;AI Companion 3.0 &lt;/a&gt;reaches Zoom&amp;#x27;s hundreds of millions of users in the coming months, they will render their own verdict — not on benchmarks they have never heard of, but on whether the meeting summary actually captured what mattered, whether the action items made sense, whether the AI saved them time or wasted it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Zoom&amp;#x27;s most provocative claim may not be that it topped a benchmark. It may be the implicit argument that in the age of AI, the best model is not the one you build — it&amp;#x27;s the one you know how to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/"&gt;Zoom Video Communications&lt;/a&gt;, the company best known for keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic, announced last week that it had achieved the highest score ever recorded on one of artificial intelligence&amp;#x27;s most demanding tests — a claim that sent ripples of surprise, skepticism, and genuine curiosity through the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Jose-based company said its AI system scored &lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic-social"&gt;48.1 percent&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://agi.safe.ai/"&gt;Humanity&amp;#x27;s Last Exam&lt;/a&gt;, a benchmark designed by subject-matter experts worldwide to stump even the most advanced AI models.

He is an elected member of the &lt;a href="https://www.nae.edu/"&gt;National Academy of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/person/xuedong-huang"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a fellow of both the &lt;a href="https://www.ieee.org/"&gt;IEEE&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.acm.org/"&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;. His credentials place him among the most accomplished AI executives in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His presence at Zoom signals that the company&amp;#x27;s AI ambitions are serious, even if its methods differ from the research laboratories that dominate headlines. In his tweet celebrating the benchmark result, Huang framed the achievement as validation of Zoom&amp;#x27;s strategy: &amp;quot;We have unlocked stronger capabilities in exploration, reasoning, and multi-model collaboration, surpassing the performance limits of any single model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That final clause — &amp;quot;surpassing the performance limits of any single model&amp;quot; — may be the most significant. Huang is not claiming Zoom built a better model. He is claiming Zoom built a better system for using models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the test designed to stump the world&amp;#x27;s smartest machines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark at the center of this controversy, &lt;a href="https://agi.safe.ai/"&gt;Humanity&amp;#x27;s Last Exam&lt;/a&gt;, was designed to be exceptionally difficult. Unlike earlier tests that AI systems learned to game through pattern matching, HLE presents problems that require genuine understanding, multi-step reasoning, and the synthesis of information across complex domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam draws on questions from experts around the world, spanning fields from advanced mathematics to philosophy to specialized scientific knowledge. A score of 48.1 percent might sound unimpressive to anyone accustomed to school grading curves, but in the context of HLE, it represents the current ceiling of machine performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This benchmark was developed by subject-matter experts globally and has become a crucial metric for measuring AI&amp;#x27;s progress toward human-level performance on challenging intellectual tasks,&amp;quot; &lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/federated-ai-approach-best-quality-for-most-popular-features/"&gt;Zoom’s announcement noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s improvement of 2.3 percentage points over Google&amp;#x27;s previous best may appear modest in isolation. But in competitive benchmarking, where gains often come in fractions of a percent, such a jump commands attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Zoom&amp;#x27;s approach reveals about the future of enterprise AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom&amp;#x27;s approach carries implications that extend well beyond benchmark leaderboards. The company is signaling a vision for enterprise AI that differs fundamentally from the model-centric strategies pursued by &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than betting everything on building the single most capable model, Zoom is positioning itself as an orchestration layer — a company that can integrate the best capabilities from multiple providers and deliver them through products that businesses already use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy hedges against a critical uncertainty in the AI market: no one knows which model will be best next month, let alone next year. By building infrastructure that can swap between providers, Zoom avoids vendor lock-in while theoretically offering customers the best available AI for any given task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/"&gt;OpenAI&amp;#x27;s GPT-5.2&lt;/a&gt; the following day underscored this dynamic. OpenAI&amp;#x27;s own communications named Zoom as a partner that had evaluated the new model&amp;#x27;s performance &amp;quot;across their AI workloads and saw measurable gains across the board.&amp;quot; Zoom, in other words, is both a customer of the frontier labs and now a competitor on their benchmarks — using their own technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This arrangement may prove sustainable. The major model providers have every incentive to sell API access widely, even to companies that might aggregate their outputs. The more interesting question is whether Zoom&amp;#x27;s orchestration capabilities constitute genuine intellectual property or merely sophisticated prompt engineering that others could replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real test arrives when Zoom&amp;#x27;s 300 million users start asking questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom titled its announcement section on industry relations &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/"&gt;A Collaborative Future&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; and Huang struck notes of gratitude throughout. &amp;quot;The future of AI is collaborative, not competitive,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;By combining the best innovations from across the industry with our own research breakthroughs, we create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framing positions Zoom as a beneficent integrator, bringing together the industry&amp;#x27;s best work for the benefit of enterprise customers. Critics see something else: a company claiming the prestige of an AI laboratory without doing the foundational research that earns it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate will likely be settled not by leaderboards but by products. When &lt;a href="https://news.zoom.com/zoom-launches-ai-companion-3-0/"&gt;AI Companion 3.0 &lt;/a&gt;reaches Zoom&amp;#x27;s hundreds of millions of users in the coming months, they will render their own verdict — not on benchmarks they have never heard of, but on whether the meeting summary actually captured what mattered, whether the action items made sense, whether the AI saved them time or wasted it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Zoom&amp;#x27;s most provocative claim may not be that it topped a benchmark. It may be the implicit argument that in the age of AI, the best model is not the one you build — it&amp;#x27;s the one you know how to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/zoom-says-it-aced-ais-hardest-exam-critics-say-it-copied-off-its-neighbors</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Adobe Firefly now supports prompt-based video editing, adds more third-party models (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3076355" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Firefly-Video-Editor-2.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that using Runway’s Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And with Adobe’s own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs’ Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January.&lt;/p&gt;

Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value.

Encouragingly, nearly three-quarters (73%) of respondents indicated they feel safe to provide honest feedback and express opinions freely in their workplace.

Far from making SEO specialists obsolete, the shift highlights clearly why skilled human optimisers remain more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As generative AI search tools reshape the digital landscape, many wonder whether traditional SEO has reached the end. Despite AI’s growing influence, the fundamentals of discoverability, authority, clarity, and trust remain vital. The rise of AI-powered search makes the role of SEO specialists more important than before, ensuring content not only reaches audiences but resonates authentically. A digital environment shaped by automation still depends heavily on human expertise, especially when credibility is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-expands-rather-than-replaces-the-work-of-seo-specialists"&gt;Why AI expands rather than replaces the work of SEO specialists&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assumption that AI will replace SEO specialists ignores how modern search works. AI expands what optimisation can achieve, but it does not eliminate the need for skilled human oversight. Traditional ranking signals like site structure, depth of information, internal linking and authority continue to influence visibility, even in AI-driven answer engines. This means content must still be crafted with intent, clarity, and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-powered search engines prioritise well-structured, trustworthy information, reinforcing the importance of thoughtful optimisation. In this brand new landscape, SEO now spans two parallel environments: classic search engines and AI-generated answer systems. Competing effectively in both requires strategic thinking, careful content planning, and a nuanced understanding of user intent: areas where human specialists excel, beyond what AI can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies like Brath, which presents SEO as one of the most profitable long-term marketing channels when executed with technical precision and strategic insight, clearly understand this reality. Its service model remains grounded in proven disciplines: technical improvements, keyword strategy, content refinement, and authority building. Rather than leaning on automation, it demonstrates that sustainable SEO relies on human expertise, methodical analysis, and consistent optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-insight-still-drives-strategy-in-an-ai-powered-search-world"&gt;Human insight still drives strategy in an AI-powered search world&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI excels at processing data, but it still falls short when deeper context, cultural awareness, and nuanced decision-making are required. SEO is more than a technical exercise; it is a strategic craft rooted in understanding people, their motivations, expectations, and the subtle differences in how they search for answers. The human dimension is something AI cannot replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists bring an understanding of why search behaviour shifts, how tone influences trust, and which narratives resonate in different industries. They also grasp how economic cycles, news events, and regulations affect user queries and engagement patterns. AI can identify patterns, but it cannot interpret them fully or determine which insights align with brand values or long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing emphasis on E-E-A-T signals, Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness, further reinforces this need for human guidance. An algorithm cannot fabricate authentic authority. It must be demonstrated through lived experience, credibility, and careful communication. SEO specialists ensure that these qualities are baked into every page and every message, guiding brands through an increasingly complex search environment where trust matters more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-seo-specialists-use-ai-to-deliver-faster-smarter-optimisation"&gt;How SEO specialists use AI to deliver faster, smarter optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where AI shines is in support, not replacement. Modern SEO specialists use AI tools to automate repetitive tasks, accelerate data analysis, and uncover patterns at scale. AI can rapidly produce initial keyword lists, identify technical issues, or generate draft structures for content. These capabilities shorten production timelines and free specialists to focus on the strategic, creative, and high-value decisions that define effective optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balanced approach enables better outcomes. AI handles the heavy lifting, while human specialists interpret the results, refine the strategy, and ensure everything aligns with the brand’s goals, tone, and audience requirements. It is this combination of speed and discernment that shapes the future of SEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-creative-and-analytical-skills-ai-cannot-replicate"&gt;The creative and analytical skills AI cannot replicate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the most advanced AI tools cannot fully replicate creativity, intuition, or emotional intelligence. SEO specialists draw on analytical skills and creative insight to produce content that stands out in competitive digital markets. AI can propose phrasing, but it cannot determine when a message needs personality, authority, or nuance to feel trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In industries where reputation matters, like fintech, finance, healthcare, law, and education, human-shaped content is essential. Users want reassurance that the guidance they read comes from people with real expertise. AI-generated content often lacks the depth or subtlety needed to build that trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human specialists also excel at interpreting data in context. They understand how search intent connects to behaviour, how content influences perception, and how messaging supports or undermines brand identity. Their ability to connect analytical insights with emotional resonance is something AI simply cannot achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-next-generation-of-seo-careers-in-an-ai-enhanced-industry"&gt;Building the next generation of SEO careers in an AI-enhanced industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is not shrinking the field of SEO; it is expanding it. The next generation of SEO professionals will blend human-centred strategy with AI-assisted efficiency. Modern SEO requires fluency in multiple areas: data interpretation, UX thinking, structured content, behavioural insights, content design, and now, AI tool management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists who embrace both disciplines will lead the industry forward. Their work will become more strategic, more aligned with long-term business value, and more influential as search becomes increasingly complex and multi-modal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI may automate tasks, but strategy, creativity, judgement, and trust-building remain human strengths. And as AI transforms how search tools interpret information, those strengths will only become more essential. SEO is not disappearing. It is evolving into a richer, more strategic, and more human discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Pexels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture1-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI search engines and generative AI tools are certainly transforming how people discover information online.

Google today launched one such experimental email-based assistant called CC through a Google Labs experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CC, which is powered by Gemini, can connect with your account, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and provide you with a daily brief via email. This “Your Day Ahead” email makes users aware of their tasks, summarizes their calendar, and provides key updates for the day from these accounts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can also reply to or email CC at any time with requests such as adding to-dos, teaching it to your preferences, remembering notes, or searching for information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the moment, CC is available to AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 or above. The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants. Sequoia-backed Mindy, which now works in the creator and marketing space, started as an email assistant. Other meeting notetakers like Read AI and Fireflies also send users a daily brief, but they might not have context from email and Drive.

While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they’ll respond,” she told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors’ communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors’ WhatsApp accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst, Accel, and the CEOs of Maven Clinic (Kate Ryder), Nubank (David Vélez), and Rappi (Simón Borrero). The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup’s mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These poor doctors they’re receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids’ school,’ or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week’,” Merin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We’re hearing from our users that they’re saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company’s long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the US, patients also demand to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Leona’s team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Caroline-Merin-horizontal-headshot.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Caroline Merin, who spent nearly a decade developing on-demand services as the first Latin American general manager for Uber Eats and later the COO of Rappi, recognized how badly healthcare tech lagged behind. While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they’ll respond,” she told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors’ communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors’ WhatsApp accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst, Accel, and the CEOs of Maven Clinic (Kate Ryder), Nubank (David Vélez), and Rappi (Simón Borrero). The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup’s mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new model, dubbed GPT-Image-1.5, is available starting Tuesday to all ChatGPT users and via the API. It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the release of Gemini 3, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator – both of which have topped the LMArena leaderboard across multiple benchmarks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the launch of GPT-5.2, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for developers and everyday professional use. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT-Image-1 in April.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT-Image-1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT Images offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3076523" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;The same image depicted above with different edits to showcase GPT-Image-1.5’s improved instruction-following. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like ‘adjust the facial expression’ or ‘make lighting colder,’ models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update isn’t just about new features. ChatGPT Images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.”&lt;/p&gt;

The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban&amp;nbsp;Meta&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Oakley&amp;nbsp;Meta&amp;nbsp;HSTN smartglasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. First announced at Meta’s Connect conference earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smartglasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a Conversation Boost feature designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a waitlist and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;
