&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As generative AI matures, enterprises are shifting from experimentation to implementation—moving beyond chatbots and copilots into the realm of intelligent, autonomous agents. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat’s &lt;/em&gt;Matt Marshall, Ashok Srivastava, SVP and Chief Data Officer at Intuit, and Hillary Packer, EVP and CTO at American Express at VB Transform, detailed how their companies are embracing agentic AI to transform customer experiences, internal workflows and core business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-models-to-missions-the-rise-of-intelligent-agents"&gt;From models to missions: the rise of intelligent agents&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Intuit, agents aren’t just about answering questions—they’re about executing tasks. In TurboTax, for instance, agents help customers complete their taxes 12% faster, with nearly half finishing in under an hour. These intelligent systems draw data from multiple streams—including real-time and batch data—via Intuit’s internal bus and persistent services. Once processed, the agent analyzes the information to make a decision and take action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the way we’re thinking about agents in the financial domain,”&amp;nbsp; said Srivastava. “We’re trying to make sure that as we build, they’re robust, scalable and actually anchored in reality. The agentic experiences we’re building are designed to get work done &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the customer, &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; their permission. That’s key to building trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These capabilities are made possible by GenOS, Intuit’s custom generative AI operating system. At its heart is GenRuntime, which Srivastava likens to a CPU: it receives the data, reasons over it, and determines an action that’s then executed for the end user. The OS was designed to abstract away technical complexity, so developers don’t need to reinvent risk safeguards or security layers every time they build an agent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across Intuit’s brands—from TurboTax and QuickBooks to Mailchimp and Credit Karma—GenOS helps create consistent, trusted experiences and ensure robustness, scalability and extensibility across use cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-agentic-stack-at-amex-trust-control-and-experimentation"&gt;Building the agentic stack at Amex: trust, control,and experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Packer and her team at Amex, the move into agentic AI builds on more than 15 years of experience with traditional AI and a mature, battle-tested big data infrastructure. As GenAI capabilities accelerate, Amex is reshaping its strategy to focus on how intelligent agents can drive internal workflows and power the next generation of customer experiences. For example, the company is focused on developing internal agents that boost employee productivity, like the APR agent that reviews software pull requests and advises engineers on whether code is ready to merge. This project reflects Amex’s broader approach: start with internal use cases, move quickly, and use early wins to refine the underlying infrastructure, tools, and governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support fast experimentation, strong security, and policy enforcement, Amex developed an “enablement layer”&amp;nbsp;that allows for rapid development without sacrificing oversight. “And so now as we think about agentic, we’ve got a nice control plane to plug in these additional, additional guardrails that we really do need to have in place,” said Packer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within this system is Amex’s concept of modular “brains”—a framework in which agents are required to consult with specific “brains” before taking action. These brains serve as modular governance layers—covering brand values, privacy, security, and legal compliance—that every agent must engage with during decision-making. Each brain represents a domain-specific set of policies, such as brand voice, privacy rules, or legal constraints and functions as a consultable authority. By routing decisions through this system of constraints, agents remain accountable, aligned with enterprise standards and worthy of user trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, a dining reservation agent operating through Rezi, Amex’s restaurant booking platform, must validate that it’s selecting the right restaurant at the right time, matching the user’s intent while adhering to brand and policy guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-architecture-that-enables-speed-and-safety"&gt;Architecture that enables speed and safety&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both AI leaders agreed that enabling rapid development at scale demands thoughtful architectural design. At Intuit, the creation of GenOS empowers hundreds of developers to build safely and consistently. The platform ensures each team can access shared infrastructure, common safeguards, and model flexibility without duplicating work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amex took a similar approach with its enablement layer. Designed around a unified control plane, the layer lets teams rapidly develop AI-driven agents while enforcing centralized policies and guardrails. It ensures consistent implementation of risk and governance frameworks while encouraging speed. Developers can deploy experiments quickly, then evaluate and scale based on feedback and performance, all without compromising brand trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-in-agentic-ai-adoption"&gt;Lessons in agentic AI adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both AI leaders stressed the need to move quickly, but with intent. “Don’t wait for a bake-off,” Packer advised. “It’s better to pick a direction, get something into production, and iterate quickly, rather than delaying for the perfect solution that may be outdated by launch time.” They also emphasized that measurement must be embedded from the very beginning. According to Srivastava, instrumentation isn’t something to bolt on later—it has to be an integral part of the stack. Tracking cost, latency, accuracy and user impact is essential for assessing value and maintaining accountability at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to be able to measure it. That’s where GenOS comes in—there’s a built-in capability that lets us instrument AI applications and track both the cost going in and the return coming out,” said Srivastava. “I review this every quarter with our CFO. We go line by line through every AI use case across the company, assessing exactly how much we’re spending and what value we’re getting in return.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intelligent-agents-are-the-next-enterprise-platform-shift"&gt;Intelligent agents are the next enterprise platform shift&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intuit and American Express are among the leading enterprises adopting agentic AI not just as a technology layer, but as a new operating model. Their approach focuses on building the agentic platform, establishing governance, measuring impact, and moving quickly. As enterprise expectations evolve from simple chatbot functionality to autonomous execution, organizations that treat agentic AI as a first-class discipline—with control planes, observability, and modular governance—will be best positioned to lead the agentic race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: As a thank-you to our readers, we’ve opened up early bird registration for VB Transform 2026 — just $200.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding on AI models is as much of a technical decision and it is a strategic one. But choosing open, closed or hybrid models all have trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While speaking at this year’s VB Transform, model architecture experts from General Motors, Zoom and IBM discussed how their companies and customers consider AI model selection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barak Turovsky, who in March became GM’s first chief AI officer, said there’s a lot of noise with every new model release and every time the leaderboard changes. Long before leaderboards were a mainstream debate, Turovsky helped launch the first large language model (LLM) and recalled the ways open-sourcing AI model weights and training data led to major breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was frankly probably one of the biggest breakthroughs that helped OpenAI and others to start launching,” Turovsky said. “So it’s actually a funny anecdote: Open-source actually helped create something that went closed and now maybe is back to being open.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Factors for decisions vary and include cost, performance, trust and safety. Turovsky said enterprises sometimes prefer a mixed strategy — using an open model for internal use and a closed model for production and customer facing or vice versa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ibm-s-ai-strategy"&gt;IBM’s AI strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armand Ruiz, IBM’s VP of AI platform, said IBM initially started its platform with its own LLMs, but then realized that wouldn’t be enough — especially as more powerful models arrived on the market. The company then expanded to offer integrations with platforms like Hugging Face so customers could pick any open-source model. (The company recently debuted a new model gateway that gives enterprises an API for switching between LLMs.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More enterprises are choosing to buy more models from multiple vendors. When Andreessen Horowitz surveyed 100 CIOs, 37% of respondents said they were using 5 or more models. Last year, only 29% were using the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choice is key, but sometimes too much choice creates confusion, said Ruiz. To help customers with their approach, IBM doesn’t worry too much about which LLM they’re using during the proof of concept or pilot phase; the main goal is feasibility. Only later they begin to look at whether to distill a model or customize one based on a customer’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“First we try to simplify all that analysis paralysis with all those options and focus on the use case,” Ruiz said. “Then we figure out what is the best path for production.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-zoom-approaches-ai"&gt;How Zoom approaches AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zoom’s customers can choose between two configurations for its AI Companion, said Zoom CTO Xuedong Huang. One involves federating the company’s own LLM with other larger foundation models. Another configuration allows customers concerned about using too many models to use just Zoom’s model. (The company also recently partnered with Google Cloud to adopt an agent-to-agent protocol for AI Companion for enterprise workflows.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company made its own small language model (SLM) without using customer data, Huang said. At 2 billion parameters, the LLM is actually very small, but it can still outperform other industry-specific models. The SLM works best on complex tasks when working alongside a larger model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is really the power of a hybrid approach,” Huang said. “Our philosophy is very straightforward. Our company is leading the way very much like Mickey Mouse and the elephant dancing together. The small model will perform a very specific task. We are not saying a small model will be good enough…The Mickey Mouse and elephant will be working together as one team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More enterprises are choosing to buy more models from multiple vendors. When Andreessen Horowitz surveyed 100 CIOs, 37% of respondents said they were using 5 or more models. Last year, only 29% were using the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choice is key, but sometimes too much choice creates confusion, said Ruiz. To help customers with their approach, IBM doesn’t worry too much about which LLM they’re using during the proof of concept or pilot phase; the main goal is feasibility. Only later they begin to look at whether to distill a model or customize one based on a customer’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“First we try to simplify all that analysis paralysis with all those options and focus on the use case,” Ruiz said. “Then we figure out what is the best path for production.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-zoom-approaches-ai"&gt;How Zoom approaches AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zoom’s customers can choose between two configurations for its AI Companion, said Zoom CTO Xuedong Huang. One involves federating the company’s own LLM with other larger foundation models. Another configuration allows customers concerned about using too many models to use just Zoom’s model. (The company also recently partnered with Google Cloud to adopt an agent-to-agent protocol for AI Companion for enterprise workflows.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company made its own small language model (SLM) without using customer data, Huang said. At 2 billion parameters, the LLM is actually very small, but it can still outperform other industry-specific models. The SLM works best on complex tasks when working alongside a larger model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is really the power of a hybrid approach,” Huang said. “Our philosophy is very straightforward. Our company is leading the way very much like Mickey Mouse and the elephant dancing together. The small model will perform a very specific task. We are not saying a small model will be good enough…The Mickey Mouse and elephant will be working together as one team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grok is xAI’s answer to models like OpenAI’s&amp;nbsp;ChatGPT&amp;nbsp;and Google’s&amp;nbsp;Gemini, and can analyze images and respond to questions. In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, which was recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also put Grok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model, GPT-5, which is expected to launch later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026415" height="348" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-9.09.23PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Musk wore a leather jacket and sat besides xAI leaders to launch Grok 4 (Credit: xAI)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday, Linda Yaccarino stepped down from her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users with antisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler. xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to have removed a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The nonprofit Arc Prize says that Grok achieves a new state-of-the-art score on its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026417" height="367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-9.34.45PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Grok 4’s performance on several academic benchmarks (Credit: xAI)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, late on Wednesday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 4, and unveiled a new $300-per-month AI subscription plan, SuperGrok Heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In March, the Indian government scrapped its 6% levy on digital advertisements, effective in April, as a move to address some of the trade concerns raised by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The United States Trade Representative had criticized the levy by calling it “discriminatory and unreasonable,” as domestic companies were exempt. Its repeal would ease costs for tech giants, including Google, Meta, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Google hosted the local version of its Marketing Live event to debut its AI-powered tools for Indian marketers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the tools is “Generated for You”, available within Product Studio, that identifies relevant content opportunities across shopping catalogs and pre-generates images and videos via AI that merchants can save or publish across Google platforms. Another tool is an opt-in feature called Smart Bidding Exploration in search campaigns, which is built on existing Smart Bidding and uses AI to find newer, qualified leads that merchants wouldn’t have captured or bid on typically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus,  Google introduced new agentic capabilities in Google Ads and Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026299" height="1280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/agentic-google-analytics.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Agentic capabilities in Google Analytics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These agentic tools can learn from advertising inputs, including datasets, landing pages, assets, and real-time campaign performance, to take the guesswork out of achieving business goals,” Dan Taylor, Vice President for Global Ads at Google, said at a virtual media roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google brought AI Max for Search Campaigns, which aims to enhance search ad campaign performance by identifying more relevant and high-performing search queries by learning from brands’ landing pages, their existing ads, and existing keyword lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian online marketplace for used electronics goods, Cashify, saw its conversions up by 15% and customer acquisition costs reduced by 12% after deploying AI Max during its early testing, Google said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced that ads will start appearing on AI Overviews in India later this year. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the company has introduced its shoppable connected TV ads on YouTube in India. YouTube’s masthead on mobile will now also start serving ads in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026301" height="488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/youtube-shoppable-masthead.jpg" width="1058" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;YouTube Shoppable Masthead now in India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;YouTube on connected TVs has been the most-watched streaming service on television in India over the past year, said Roma Datta Chobey, managing director of Digital Native Industries at Google India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, the country has been a significant market for YouTube Shorts, with short videos on the platform viewed trillions of times since launch. As many as 87% of Indian consumers watch YouTube or Shorts as part of their shopping journey, Chobey said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s digital advertising presence is growing, as the world’s second-largest internet market continues to see more users come online. The country’s digital ad market is projected to grow over 20% year-over-year, reaching nearly $7 billion by the end of 2025, per a recent Dentsu Digital Advertising report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India is such a thriving digital ecosystem. We have the largest number of users who are actively trying and testing our products. So, that’s really the reason behind us getting these innovations to India faster,” Chobey said, in response to TechCrunch’s question about the timing of the new AI ad tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google confirmed to TechCrunch that its newly launched features including AI Max for Search Campaigns, Smart Bidding Exploration, YouTube’s shoppable masthead and CTV, and Performance Max Retention-Only Mode support Hindi to improve local campaign compatibility. Additionally, the company introduced state-level urban and rural audience filters for Indian advertisers to enable more granular media planning, buying, and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has long been a key market for Google, not just because it hosts the company’s largest user base but also due to consistent growth in ad revenues. In fiscal year 2024, Google’s gross ad revenue in India increased 11% year-over-year to ₹312.21 billion ($3.6 billion), while its net advertising revenue rose 18% to ₹27.43 billion ($320 million).&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google has launched a suite of its AI-powered advertising tools in India, which debuted in the U.S. in May, as the repeal of the so-called “Google tax” has made the South Asian market more attractive to global tech firms selling online ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced that ads will start appearing on AI Overviews in India later this year. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the company has introduced its shoppable connected TV ads on YouTube in India. YouTube’s masthead on mobile will now also start serving ads in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3026301" height="488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/youtube-shoppable-masthead.jpg" width="1058" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;YouTube Shoppable Masthead now in India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;YouTube on connected TVs has been the most-watched streaming service on television in India over the past year, said Roma Datta Chobey, managing director of Digital Native Industries at Google India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, the country has been a significant market for YouTube Shorts, with short videos on the platform viewed trillions of times since launch. As many as 87% of Indian consumers watch YouTube or Shorts as part of their shopping journey, Chobey said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s digital advertising presence is growing, as the world’s second-largest internet market continues to see more users come online. The country’s digital ad market is projected to grow over 20% year-over-year, reaching nearly $7 billion by the end of 2025, per a recent Dentsu Digital Advertising report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India is such a thriving digital ecosystem. We have the largest number of users who are actively trying and testing our products. So, that’s really the reason behind us getting these innovations to India faster,” Chobey said, in response to TechCrunch’s question about the timing of the new AI ad tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google confirmed to TechCrunch that its newly launched features including AI Max for Search Campaigns, Smart Bidding Exploration, YouTube’s shoppable masthead and CTV, and Performance Max Retention-Only Mode support Hindi to improve local campaign compatibility. Additionally, the company introduced state-level urban and rural audience filters for Indian advertisers to enable more granular media planning, buying, and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has long been a key market for Google, not just because it hosts the company’s largest user base but also due to consistent growth in ad revenues. In fiscal year 2024, Google’s gross ad revenue in India increased 11% year-over-year to ₹312.21 billion ($3.6 billion), while its net advertising revenue rose 18% to ₹27.43 billion ($320 million).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/google-brings-its-ai-powered-marketing-tools-to-india-after-google-tax-repeal/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] This tool strips away anti-AI protections from digital art (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/10/1119937/tool-strips-away-anti-ai-protections-from-digital-art/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrape-art-1c_5925de.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new technique called LightShed will make it harder for artists to use existing protective tools to stop their work from being ingested for AI training.

LightShed, however, claims to be able to subvert these tools and others like them, making it easy for the artwork to be used for training once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the researchers behind LightShed aren’t trying to steal artists’ work. They just don’t want people to get a false sense of security. “You will not be sure if companies have methods to delete these poisons but will never tell you,” says Hanna Foerster, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge and the lead author of a paper on the work. And if they do, it may be too late to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI models work, in part, by implicitly creating boundaries between what they perceive as different categories of images. Glaze and Nightshade change enough pixels to push a given piece of art over this boundary without affecting the image’s quality, causing the model to see it as something it’s not. These almost imperceptible changes are called perturbations, and they mess up the AI model’s ability to understand the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glaze makes models misunderstand style (e.g., interpreting a photorealistic painting as a cartoon). Nightshade instead makes the model see the subject incorrectly (e.g., interpreting a cat in a drawing as a dog). Glaze is used to defend an artist’s individual style, whereas Nightshade is used to attack AI models that crawl the internet for art.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Foerster worked with a team of researchers from the Technical University of Darmstadt and the University of Texas at San Antonio to develop LightShed, which learns how to see where tools like Glaze and Nightshade splash this sort of digital poison onto art so that it can effectively clean it off. The group will present its findings at the Usenix Security Symposium, a leading global cybersecurity conference, in August.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The researchers trained LightShed by feeding it pieces of art with and without Nightshade, Glaze, and other similar programs applied. Foerster describes the process as teaching LightShed to reconstruct “just the poison on poisoned images.” Identifying a cutoff for how much poison will actually confuse an AI makes it easier to “wash” just the poison off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LightShed is incredibly effective at this. While other researchers have found simple ways to subvert poisoning, LightShed appears to be more adaptable. It can even apply what it’s learned from one anti-AI tool—say, Nightshade—to others like Mist or MetaCloak without ever seeing them ahead of time. While it has some trouble performing against small doses of poison, those are less likely to kill the AI models’ abilities to understand the underlying art, making it a win-win for the AI—or a lose-lose for the artists using these tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around 7.5 million people, many of them artists with small and medium-size followings and fewer resources, have downloaded Glaze to protect their art. Those using tools like Glaze see it as an important technical line of defense, especially when the state of regulation around AI training and copyright is still up in the air. The LightShed authors see their work as a warning that tools like Glaze are not permanent solutions. “It might need a few more rounds of trying to come up with better ideas for protection,” says Foerster.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The creators of Glaze and Nightshade seem to agree with that sentiment: The website for Nightshade warned the tool wasn’t future-proof before work on LightShed ever began. And Shan, who led research on both tools, still believes defenses like his have meaning even if there are ways around them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a deterrent,” says Shan—a way to warn AI companies that artists are serious about their concerns. The goal, as he puts it, is to put up as many roadblocks as possible so that AI companies find it easier to just work with artists. He believes that “most artists kind of understand this is a temporary solution,” but that creating those obstacles against the unwanted use of their work is still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Foerster hopes to use what she learned through LightShed to build new defenses for artists, including clever watermarks that somehow persist with the artwork even after it’s gone through an AI model.

It’s pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into putting renewable sources like wind and solar on its grid, manufacturing millions of electric vehicles, and building out capacity for energy storage, nuclear power, and more. This investment has been transformational for the country’s economy and has contributed to establishing China as a major player in global politics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the US, a massive new tax and spending bill just cut hundreds of billions in credits, grants, and loans for clean energy technologies. It’s a stark reversal from previous policies, and it could have massive effects at a time when it feels as if everyone is chasing China on energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So while we all try to get our heads around what’s next for climate tech in the US and beyond, let’s look at just how dominant China is when it comes to clean energy, as documented in three charts.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;China is on an absolute tear installing wind and solar power. The country reached nearly 900 gigawatts of installed capacity for solar at the end of 2024, and the rapid pace of building has continued into this year. An additional 198 GW was installed between January and May, with 93 GW coming in May alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For context, those additions over the first five months of the year account for more than double the capacity of the grid in California. Not the renewables capacity of that state—&lt;em&gt;the entire grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the policy shift in the US is projected to slow down new solar and wind additions. With tax credits and other support stripped away, much of the new capacity that was expected to come online by the end of the decade will now face delays or cancellations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s significant because of all the new electricity generation capacity that’s come online in the US recently, renewables make up the vast majority. Solar and battery storage alone are expected to make up over 80% of capacity additions in 2025. So slowing down wind and solar basically means slowing down adding new electricity capacity, at a time when demand is very much set to rise. (Hello, AI?)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;China’s EV market is also booming—the country is currently flirting with a big symbolic milestone, nearing the point where over half of all new vehicles sold in the country are electric. (It already passed that mark for a single month and could do so on a yearly basis in the next couple of years.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just selling those vehicles within China, either: the country exports them globally, with customers including established markets like Europe and growing ones like India and Brazil. As of 2024, more than 70% of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on roads around the world were built in ChinaSome leaders in legacy automakers are taking notice. Ford CEO Jim Farley shared some striking comments at the Aspen Ideas Festival last month about how far ahead China is on vehicle technology and price. “They have far superior in-vehicle technology,” Farley said. “We are in a global competition with China, and it's not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China is still pouring money into renewables, storage, grids, and energy efficiency technologies. It’s also outspending the rest of the world on nuclear power. The country tripled its investment in renewable power from 2015 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation isn’t set in stone, though: The US actually very briefly overtook China on battery investments over the past year, as Cat Clifford at &lt;em&gt;Cipher&lt;/em&gt; reported last week. But changes resulting from the new bill could very quickly reverse that progress, cementing China as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;place for battery manufacturing and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a story earlier this week, the MIT economist David Autor laid out the high stakes for this race. Advanced manufacturing and technology are beneficial for US prosperity, and putting public support and trade protections in place for key industries could be crucial to keeping them going, he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d add that this whole discussion shouldn’t be about a zero-sum competition between the US and China. But many experts argue that the US, where I and many readers live, is surrendering its leadership and ability to develop key energy technologies of the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the numbers don’t lie: By a lot of measures, China is the world’s leader in energy. The question is, will that change anytime soon?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

The country reached nearly 900 gigawatts of installed capacity for solar at the end of 2024, and the rapid pace of building has continued into this year. An additional 198 GW was installed between January and May, with 93 GW coming in May alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For context, those additions over the first five months of the year account for more than double the capacity of the grid in California. Not the renewables capacity of that state—&lt;em&gt;the entire grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the policy shift in the US is projected to slow down new solar and wind additions. With tax credits and other support stripped away, much of the new capacity that was expected to come online by the end of the decade will now face delays or cancellations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s significant because of all the new electricity generation capacity that’s come online in the US recently, renewables make up the vast majority. Solar and battery storage alone are expected to make up over 80% of capacity additions in 2025. So slowing down wind and solar basically means slowing down adding new electricity capacity, at a time when demand is very much set to rise. (Hello, AI?)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;China’s EV market is also booming—the country is currently flirting with a big symbolic milestone, nearing the point where over half of all new vehicles sold in the country are electric. (It already passed that mark for a single month and could do so on a yearly basis in the next couple of years.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just selling those vehicles within China, either: the country exports them globally, with customers including established markets like Europe and growing ones like India and Brazil. As of 2024, more than 70% of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on roads around the world were built in ChinaSome leaders in legacy automakers are taking notice. Ford CEO Jim Farley shared some striking comments at the Aspen Ideas Festival last month about how far ahead China is on vehicle technology and price. “They have far superior in-vehicle technology,” Farley said. “We are in a global competition with China, and it's not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China is still pouring money into renewables, storage, grids, and energy efficiency technologies. It’s also outspending the rest of the world on nuclear power. The country tripled its investment in renewable power from 2015 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation isn’t set in stone, though: The US actually very briefly overtook China on battery investments over the past year, as Cat Clifford at &lt;em&gt;Cipher&lt;/em&gt; reported last week. But changes resulting from the new bill could very quickly reverse that progress, cementing China as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;place for battery manufacturing and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a story earlier this week, the MIT economist David Autor laid out the high stakes for this race. Advanced manufacturing and technology are beneficial for US prosperity, and putting public support and trade protections in place for key industries could be crucial to keeping them going, he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d add that this whole discussion shouldn’t be about a zero-sum competition between the US and China. But many experts argue that the US, where I and many readers live, is surrendering its leadership and ability to develop key energy technologies of the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the numbers don’t lie: By a lot of measures, China is the world’s leader in energy. The question is, will that change anytime soon?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.
