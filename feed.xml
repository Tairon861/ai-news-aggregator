&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ozlo-s-platform-ambitions-began"&gt;How Ozlo’s platform ambitions began&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081455" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081456" height="293" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?” &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081511" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg" width="600" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-to-help-you-sleep-better"&gt;An AI to help you sleep better &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081454" height="551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ozlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (The company revealed the “buddy” name for its AI agent in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI features are expected in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-hardware-eeg-insights-on-the-way"&gt;New hardware, EEG insights on the way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081458" height="386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-12.26.39-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Segotia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-acquisition-play"&gt;The acquisition play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s &lt;em&gt;Search Off the Record&lt;/em&gt; podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, illustrates the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend.

&lt;h2&gt;Signal in the noise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google only provides general SEO recommendations, leaving the Internet’s SEO experts to cast bones and read tea leaves to gauge how the search algorithm works. This approach has borne fruit in the past, but not every SEO suggestion is a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumultuous current state of the Internet, defined by inconsistent traffic and rapidly expanding use of AI, may entice struggling publishers to try more SEO snake oil like content chunking. When traffic is scarce, people will watch for any uptick and attribute that to the changes they have made. When the opposite happens, well, it’s just a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content superstition may appear to work at first, but at best, that’s an artifact of Google’s current quirks—the company isn’t building LLMs to like split-up content. Sullivan admits there may be “edge cases” where content chunking appears to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great. That’s what’s happening now, but tomorrow the systems may change,” he said. “You’ve made all these things that you did specifically for a ranking system, not for a human being because you were trying to be more successful in the ranking system, not staying focused on the human being. And then the systems improve, probably the way the systems always try to improve, to reward content written for humans. All that stuff that you did to please this LLM system that may or may not have worked, may not carry through for the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably won’t see chunking go away as long as publishers can point to a positive effect. However, Google seems to feel that chopping up content for LLMs is not a viable future for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As has been the case for the past two years, AI&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware&amp;nbsp;upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements.&amp;nbsp;This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the&amp;nbsp;place&amp;nbsp;that agentic AI held&amp;nbsp;last year as the show’s buzzy topic.&amp;nbsp;That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;all over the show and&amp;nbsp;showcased&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;numerous&amp;nbsp;press events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To&amp;nbsp;relive&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time&amp;nbsp;via our live blog right here.&amp;nbsp;Otherwise,&amp;nbsp;let’s&amp;nbsp;dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from&amp;nbsp;CES.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-reveals-ai-model-for-autonomous-vehicles-showcases-rubin-architecture"&gt;Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes,&amp;nbsp;setting the stage for 2026, and yes,&amp;nbsp;hanging out with some robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Rubin computing&amp;nbsp;architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is&amp;nbsp;set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our&amp;nbsp;senior AI&amp;nbsp;editor&amp;nbsp;Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world,&amp;nbsp;showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models&amp;nbsp;and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year.&amp;nbsp;That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li,&amp;nbsp;Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the&amp;nbsp;partner&amp;nbsp;showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak&amp;nbsp;detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers&amp;nbsp;using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s&amp;nbsp;face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES.&amp;nbsp;We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but&amp;nbsp;we’re&amp;nbsp;open to more suggestions!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-highlights-from-ces-breakout-sessions"&gt;Highlights from CES breakout sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CES&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;all hardware&amp;nbsp;showcases&amp;nbsp;and show floor attractions — there are plenty of&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We&amp;nbsp;kept tabs on&amp;nbsp;a few notable highlights, ranging from&amp;nbsp;Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the&amp;nbsp;“learn once, work forever” era may be over,&amp;nbsp;to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,”&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service,&amp;nbsp;to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ford-s-ai-assistant-debuts"&gt;Ford’s AI assistant debuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As&amp;nbsp;we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the&amp;nbsp;assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caterpillar-nvidia-partner-on-automated-construction-equipment"&gt;Caterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world,&amp;nbsp;Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;at CES Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lg-s-home-robot-cloid-nbsp-makes-a-sluggish-first-impression"&gt;LG’s home robot CLOiD&amp;nbsp;makes a sluggish first impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild?&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD&amp;nbsp;didn’t&amp;nbsp;do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the&amp;nbsp;eufyMake&amp;nbsp;E1&amp;nbsp;is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water&amp;nbsp;bottles,&amp;nbsp;and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals.&amp;nbsp;Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push&amp;nbsp;you’d&amp;nbsp;expect at CES, with&amp;nbsp;the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers&amp;nbsp;looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on&amp;nbsp;Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new&amp;nbsp;Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta&amp;nbsp;runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and&amp;nbsp;more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES,&amp;nbsp;from three-screen laptops&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;haptic gaming cushions&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project&amp;nbsp;Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;the glasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Senior writer Amanda&amp;nbsp;Silberling&amp;nbsp;has all the details here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As has been the case for the past two years, AI&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware&amp;nbsp;upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements.&amp;nbsp;This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the&amp;nbsp;place&amp;nbsp;that agentic AI held&amp;nbsp;last year as the show’s buzzy topic.&amp;nbsp;That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;all over the show and&amp;nbsp;showcased&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;numerous&amp;nbsp;press events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To&amp;nbsp;relive&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time&amp;nbsp;via our live blog right here.&amp;nbsp;Otherwise,&amp;nbsp;let’s&amp;nbsp;dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from&amp;nbsp;CES.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-sums-up-the-highs-and-lows-of-ces-2026-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity sums up the highs, and lows, of CES 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-reveals-ai-model-for-autonomous-vehicles-showcases-rubin-architecture"&gt;Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes,&amp;nbsp;setting the stage for 2026, and yes,&amp;nbsp;hanging out with some robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Rubin computing&amp;nbsp;architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is&amp;nbsp;set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our&amp;nbsp;senior AI&amp;nbsp;editor&amp;nbsp;Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world,&amp;nbsp;showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models&amp;nbsp;and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year.&amp;nbsp;That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-s-keynote-highlights-new-processors-and-partnerships-nbsp"&gt;AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li,&amp;nbsp;Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the&amp;nbsp;partner&amp;nbsp;showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak&amp;nbsp;detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers&amp;nbsp;using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s&amp;nbsp;face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES.&amp;nbsp;We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but&amp;nbsp;we’re&amp;nbsp;open to more suggestions!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-highlights-from-ces-breakout-sessions"&gt;Highlights from CES breakout sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CES&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;all hardware&amp;nbsp;showcases&amp;nbsp;and show floor attractions — there are plenty of&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We&amp;nbsp;kept tabs on&amp;nbsp;a few notable highlights, ranging from&amp;nbsp;Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the&amp;nbsp;“learn once, work forever” era may be over,&amp;nbsp;to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,”&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service,&amp;nbsp;to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ford-s-ai-assistant-debuts"&gt;Ford’s AI assistant debuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As&amp;nbsp;we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the&amp;nbsp;assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caterpillar-nvidia-partner-on-automated-construction-equipment"&gt;Caterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world,&amp;nbsp;Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was&amp;nbsp;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;at CES Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
