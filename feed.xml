Cameras watch production lines, sensors track machines, and software records each step of processes. However, much of that information can’t create faster decisions or lead to fewer breakdowns. For large manufacturing firms, the missed opportunity is pushing AI from small trials into core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift helps explain why Bosch plans to invest about €2.9 billion in artificial intelligence by 2027, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The spending is aimed at manufacturing, supply chain management, and perception systems, areas where the company sees AI as a way to improve how physical systems behave in real conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Bosch uses AI to catch manufacturing problems earlier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In manufacturing, delays and defects frequently start small. A minor variation in materials or machine settings can ripple through a production line. Bosch has been applying AI models to camera feeds and sensor data to detect quality issues earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of catching defects after products are finished, systems can flag problems while items are still on the line. That gives workers time to change operations before waste increases. For high-volume manufacturing, earlier detection can reduce scrap and limit the need for rework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equipment maintenance is another area under pressure. Many factories still rely on fixed schedules or manual inspections, which can miss early warning signs of errors or failure. AI models trained on vibration and temperature data can help predict when a machine is likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows maintenance teams to plan repairs instead of reacting to breakdowns. The aim is to reduce unplanned downtime without replacing equipment too early. Over time, this approach can extend the working life of machines while keeping production more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making supply chains more adaptable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply chains are also part of the investment focus. Disruptions that became visible during the pandemic have not fully disappeared, and manufacturers are still dealing with shifting demand and transport delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI systems can help forecast needs, track parts in sites, and adjust plans when conditions change. Even small improvements in planning accuracy can have a broad effect when applied in hundreds of factories and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch is funding perception systems, which help machines understand their surroundings. Systems combine input from cameras, radar, and other sensors with AI models that can recognise objects, judge distance, or spot changes in the environment. They are used in areas like factory automation, driver assistance, and robotics, where machines must respond quickly and safely. In these environments, AI is reacting to real-world conditions as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why edge computing matters on the factory floor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this work takes place at the edge. In factories and vehicles, sending data to a distant cloud system and waiting for a response can add delay or create risk if connections fail. Running AI models locally allows systems to respond in real time and keep operating even when networks are unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also limits how much sensitive data leaves a site. For industrial companies, that can matter as much as speed, especially when production processes are closely guarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud systems still play a role, though mostly behind the scenes. Training models, managing updates, and analysing trends in locations often happens in central environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many manufacturers are moving toward a hybrid setup, using cloud systems for coordination and learning, and edge systems for action. The pattern is becoming common in industrial firms, not just Bosch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling AI beyond small trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the investment matters, as small AI tests can show promise, but rolling them out across all operations takes funding, skilled staff, and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch executives have described AI as a way to support workers not replace them, and as a tool to handle the complexity that humans cannot manage. That view reflects a broader shift in industry, where AI is treated less as an experiment and more as basic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Bosch’s manufacturing AI strategy shows in practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising energy costs, labour shortages, and tighter margins leave less room for inefficiency. Automation alone no longer solves those problems. Companies are looking for systems that can adjust to changing conditions without constant manual input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch’s €2.9 billion commitment sits in that wider shift. Other large manufacturers are making similar moves, often without public fanfare, by upgrading factories and retraining staff. What stands out is the focus on operational use rather than customer-facing features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these efforts show how end-user companies are applying AI today. The work is less about bold claims and more about reducing waste, improving uptime, and making complex systems easier to manage. For industrial firms, that practical focus may define how AI delivers value over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by P.

Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

To date, many organisations limit AI to general-purpose chatbots, often created by small groups of early adopters. According to Nexos.ai, that model will give way to something more operational: fleets of task-specific AI agents embedded directly into business workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even isolated agents are in common use, screening CVs, reviewing contracts, drafting routine correspondence, preparing management reports and orchestrating actions in enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis from the company suggests organisations that move from single chatbots to multiple role-specific agents see materially higher adoption and claim a clearer business impact. Teams interact with agents that can behave like junior colleagues, where each agent is accountable for a defined slice of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every team gets its own named agent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s studies envisage the normalisation of named AI agents assigned on a per team basis, which it describes as an “AI intern”. These are not general-purpose assistants, but dedicated tools for specific operational processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, HR teams might deploy agents tuned to recruitment criteria, or legal teams using agents configured to flag contract standard violations. Sales teams will rely on agents optimised for their sales pipelines and integrated with an existing CRM. In each case, Nexos says the business value comes from contextual awareness and integration with existing software and date, rather than from advances in the raw power of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early enterprise deployments suggest the gains can be significant. Payhawk, for example, reports that its deployment of Nexos.ai’s agentic platform in finance, customer support, and operations reduced the necessary security investigation time by 80%. The company achieved 98% data accuracy and cut its processing costs by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žilvinas Girėnas, head of product at Nexos.ai, says the real benefit stems from coordination. “The shift from single-purpose agents to coordinated AI teams is fundamental. Businesses are […] building groups of specialised agents that work together in a workflow. That’s when AI stops being a pilot and starts becoming infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Platform consolidation becomes unavoidable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number of active agents in organisations rises, a second-order problem – fragmentation – appears. Teams running five to ten agents in different tools face duplicate costs and inconsistency in security controls. From the perspective of IT governance, this situation can become unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from early Nexos adopters suggests consolidating agents on a enterprise-wide shared platform delivers faster deployment – in some cases twice as fast – and gives better oversight over spend and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girėnas says: “When teams are juggling multiple vendors and logins, usage drops. A single platform is what allows organisations to extract consistent value rather than paying for shelfware.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation points to pattern familiar to enterprise technology veterans: AI agent systems follow the same trajectory of consolidation seen in collaboration, security, and analytics stacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI operations shifts to the business&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s findings suggest that the ownership of AI operations is moving from engineering teams and towards business leaders and discrete business functions. The function-specific deployment model means heads of HR, legal, finance, and sales are will expected to configure their own agents, a task that include prompt management. Thus, the ability to manage agents will become a core operational competency for individuals and business functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This places new requirements on agentic platforms, with the need for interfaces that are approachable by non-technical users, with the stack operating with minimal reliance on APIs or developer-style tooling. Team leads will need to be able to adjust instructions, test outputs from their adopted systems and find ways to scale successful configurations. Engineering support will be reserved for isolated problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Demand will outstrip delivery capacity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nexos.ai’s final prediction is the appearance of a capacity challenge. It says that once teams can deploy their first few agents successfully, demand for similar systems will accelerate in the organisation. Marketing departments may look for workflow automation, finance pros will want compliance-checking agents, and customer success teams will explore the effects of support triage: Each department, seeing proven value elsewhere, will expect similar abilities and efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry projections suggest that by the end of 2026, around 40% of enterprise software applications will incorporate task-specific AI agents, up from under 5% in 2024. Engineering capacity is unlikely to keep pace if every agent is built from scratch – thus the call for centralised capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organisations that cope best will be those with agent &lt;em&gt;libraries&lt;/em&gt; rather than bespoke builds,” Girėnas says. “Templates, playbooks, and pre-built agents are the only way to meet rising demand without overwhelming delivery teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Office Assistant” by LornaJane.net is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1129750" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Invisible-article-art-v1@300x.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenges of organizing and contextualizing unstructured data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How computer vision gave the Charlotte Hornets an edge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you've never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that's never existed before.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation of a basketball match&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_5"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking AI pilot programs into production&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We couldn't do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can't assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That's where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_5"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking AI pilot programs into production&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We couldn't do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can't assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That's where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080991" height="1080" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Spangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spangle’s approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

Gmail is also launching AI Overviews in search and a Grammarly-like “Proofread” feature. Additionally, Gmail is bringing to all users several AI features that were previously available only to paid users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you’ll see updates such as “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080898" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don’t worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080899" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080900" height="380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google has unveiled a new AI Inbox for Gmail that’s designed to provide a personalized overview of your tasks and keep you informed about important updates.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 13-15, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080899" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080900" height="380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gmail-debuts-a-personalized-ai-inbox-ai-overviews-in-search-and-more/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google announces AI Overviews in Gmail search, experimental AI-organized inbox (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-announces-ai-overviews-in-gmail-search-experimental-ai-organized-inbox/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Gmail made us all rethink how email could work when it debuted more than 20 years ago. Google thinks we’re in the process of another email transformation courtesy of AI. The company has unveiled a new round of AI features that will make Gemini an even more integral part of Gmail. The new Gemini experiences are coming to paying subscribers starting today, and a collection of previously premium-only AI features are rolling out widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Overviews first appeared in Gmail last year to summarize email chains, and now it’s expanding to Gmail search. This is closer to the AI Overview experience to which you are accustomed in Google’s web search. You can enter a natural language search, and the robot churns through your messages to generate a response.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, the user looks up a past plumbing quote. Traditionally, Gmail would show emails that are likely matches for your search. With AI Overview, you instead get a nicely formatted AI answer that includes all the relevant information and cites the email. That sounds all well and good, assuming it works. AI Overviews in search is notoriously inaccurate when summarizing search results, but grounding it in your email could make it less likely to screw up. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also begin seeing a new proofreading tool in Gmail. Proofreading suggestions will appear as dotted underlines in your email text, offering suggestions to streamline and clarify your writing. Google says AI Proofreading can make more nuanced changes than standard spellchecking features thanks to the company’s largest and most powerful Gemini 3 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2134368-2" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Demo.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /&gt;Gmail AI Inbox&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Gmail AI Inbox

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Google is previewing a new version of its iconic inbox—no, not that Inbox. The AI Inbox will roll out to a group of “trusted testers” before making its way to more users. The AI Inbox looks at your unread mail and creates an interactive list with “Priorities” at the top. If Gemini thinks an email is important, it will become a line item in that section. Below that is “Catch me up,” which summarizes less important messages. Again, this is based on Gemini’s ability to delineate important from unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company stresses that AI Inbox will be optional when it arrives. However, we could imagine a future in which it becomes the default view. Google doesn’t have a timeline for when this one will move beyond testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AI future of Gmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also beginning to see how Google’s AI changes filter down through the subscription tiers. Email summaries, Help me write, and Suggested replies launched last year and were initially limited to those paying for AI Pro or Ultra. Google notes most Gmail users aren’t paying for either one. Now, all those people will have access to those features as they move to the free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect it will be a similar story for the features announced today. At launch, you’ll need a premium AI plan to access Proofread and Search AI Overviews (and presumably AI Inbox when it’s ready). Down the line, they will likely expand to all Gmail users. So if you were happy to see AI features limited to paid users, that reprieve is looking rather short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is used to being asked if the latest raft of AI inbox features can be disabled. The answer has always been “yes,” and that’s still the case for the new expansion of AI in Gmail. However, Gemini doesn’t have its own toggle. By lumping AI into “Smart Features,” you can only ditch Gemini if you’re also willing to give up features like package tracking cards, calendar integration, and loyalty cards in Wallet. If you don’t mind losing all that, you can keep Gemini out of your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

Google says AI Proofreading can make more nuanced changes than standard spellchecking features thanks to the company’s largest and most powerful Gemini 3 models.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Google is previewing a new version of its iconic inbox—no, not that Inbox. The AI Inbox will roll out to a group of “trusted testers” before making its way to more users. The AI Inbox looks at your unread mail and creates an interactive list with “Priorities” at the top. If Gemini thinks an email is important, it will become a line item in that section. Below that is “Catch me up,” which summarizes less important messages. Again, this is based on Gemini’s ability to delineate important from unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The company stresses that AI Inbox will be optional when it arrives. However, we could imagine a future in which it becomes the default view. Google doesn’t have a timeline for when this one will move beyond testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AI future of Gmail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also beginning to see how Google’s AI changes filter down through the subscription tiers. Email summaries, Help me write, and Suggested replies launched last year and were initially limited to those paying for AI Pro or Ultra. Google notes most Gmail users aren’t paying for either one. Now, all those people will have access to those features as they move to the free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect it will be a similar story for the features announced today. At launch, you’ll need a premium AI plan to access Proofread and Search AI Overviews (and presumably AI Inbox when it’s ready). Down the line, they will likely expand to all Gmail users. So if you were happy to see AI features limited to paid users, that reprieve is looking rather short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is used to being asked if the latest raft of AI inbox features can be disabled. The answer has always been “yes,” and that’s still the case for the new expansion of AI in Gmail. However, Gemini doesn’t have its own toggle. By lumping AI into “Smart Features,” you can only ditch Gemini if you’re also willing to give up features like package tracking cards, calendar integration, and loyalty cards in Wallet. If you don’t mind losing all that, you can keep Gemini out of your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. So while these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them.

The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. So while these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them.

According to a new nationwide study by Confused.com Life Insurance, three in five Brits now use AI to self-diagnose health conditions. Through various searches, like side effects of medical conditions, treatment options, and symptom checks, as much as 11% of respondents claim AI has helped improve their conditions. More than a third (35%) are likely to use AI in this context in the future, moving away from traditional GP appointments – increasingly harder to get at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the average GP appointment waiting time is currently 10 days, a period too long for many. Therefore, health related searches have significantly risen since January 2025, including “what is my illness?”, increasing by 85%, “what are the symptoms for?” (33%), and “side effects” (22%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="org78b0bf4"&gt;Most common health-related queries with AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Confused.com, the most searched for health-related query is symptom checks, with 63% seeking advice from AI. Next are side effects at 50% and lifestyle and well-being techniques at 38%. 20% have also sought mental health support through therapy or recommended coping strategies, treating ChatGPT as their virtual therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;35% of respondents over 65 are using AI to self diagnose, with 54% using the technology to check their symptoms. This pales in comparison to 18-24 year olds, with 85% using AI to search regularly for health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Vaughan, life insurance expert at Confused.com, commented on these latest findings, saying, “Advances in AI technology have created a new way for people to approach healthcare and self-diagnosis.

Not having to physically speak to a doctor is another reason many turned to AI. 24% said they feel more comfortable using AI than discussing their health face to face with a healthcare professional, rising to 39% for 18-24 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17% are searching for alternative medical solutions and support via AI, increasing to 27% for those aged 25-34. Money is another key factor, as 20% feel self diagnosis through AI could save them substantial private healthcare fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI has also had a positive influence for non-binary individuals and those with an alternative identity. 75% said the technology’s diagnosis had helped them a “great deal”, compared to just 13% for men and 9% for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, AI seems to have a positive impact on users’ health situations. For instance, 11% stated that AI has helped their health conditions “a great deal,” while 41% claimed it has helped “somewhat.” The hope is that this self-diagnosis, though not guaranteeing accuracy, will encourage people to visit their GP for a formal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a minority of respondents (9%) felt AI has not helped their health in any way, indicating traditional healthcare methods are more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Vaughan emphasised the importance of GP consultations. “While AI can be useful for initial research and gaining an understanding of a condition, it’s clear that for the ultimate peace of mind people should consult a GP or pharmacist.

          &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-worn pattern in the development of AI chatbots. Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter ZombieAgent, son of ShadowLeak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user’s private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of attack has been demonstrated repeatedly against virtually all major large language models. One example was ShadowLeak, a data-exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT that Radware disclosed last September. It targeted Deep Research, a Chat-GPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI had introduced earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, OpenAI introduced mitigations that blocked the attack. With modest effort, however, Radware has found a bypass method that effectively revived ShadowLeak. The security firm has named the revised attack ZombieAgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attackers can easily design prompts that technically comply with these rules while still achieving malicious goals,” Radware researchers wrote in a post on Thursday. “For example, ZombieAgent used a character-by-character exfiltration technique and indirect link manipulation to circumvent the guardrails OpenAI implemented to prevent its predecessor, ShadowLeak, from exfiltrating sensitive information. Because the LLM has no inherent understanding of intent and no reliable boundary between system instructions and external content, these attacker methods remain effective despite incremental vendor improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZombieAgent was also able to give the attack persistence by directing ChatGPT to store the bypass logic in the long-term memory assigned to each user.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with a vast number of other LLM vulnerabilities, the root cause is the inability to distinguish valid instructions in prompts from users and those embedded into emails or other documents that anyone—including attackers—can send to the target. When the user configures the AI agent to summarize an email, the LLM interprets instructions incorporated into a message as a valid prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI developers have so far been unable to devise a means for LLMs to distinguish between the sources of the directives. As a result, platforms must resort to blocking specific attacks. Developers remain unable to reliably close this class of vulnerability, known as indirect prompt injection, or simply prompt injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompt injection ShadowLeak used instructed Deep Research to write a Radware-controlled link and append parameters to it. The injection defined the parameters as an employee’s name and address. When Deep Research complied, it opened the link and, in the process, exfiltrated the information to the website’s event log.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To block the attack, OpenAI restricted ChatGPT to solely open URLs exactly as provided and refuse to add parameters to them, even when explicitly instructed to do otherwise. With that, ShadowLeak was blocked, since the LLM was unable to construct new URLs by concatenating words or names, appending query parameters, or inserting user-derived data into a base URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radware’s ZombieAgent tweak was simple. The researchers revised the prompt injection to supply a complete list of pre-constructed URLs. Each one contained the base URL appended by a single number or letter of the alphabet, for example, example.com/a, example.com/b, and every subsequent letter of the alphabet, along with example.com/0 through example.com/9. The prompt also instructed the agent to substitute a special token for spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZombieAgent worked because OpenAI developers didn’t restrict the appending of a single letter to a URL. That allowed the attack to exfiltrate data letter by letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has mitigated the ZombieAgent attack by restricting ChatGPT from opening any link originating from an email unless it either appears in a well-known public index or was provided directly by the user in a chat prompt. The tweak is aimed at barring the agent from opening base URLs that lead to an attacker-controlled domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, OpenAI is hardly alone in this unending cycle of mitigating an attack only to see it revived through a simple change. If the past five years are any guide, this pattern is likely to endure indefinitely, in much the way SQL injection and memory corruption vulnerabilities continue to provide hackers with the fuel they need to compromise software and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Guardrails should not be considered fundamental solutions for the prompt injection problems,” Pascal Geenens, VP of threat intelligence at Radware, wrote in an email. “Instead, they are a quick fix to stop a specific attack. As long as there is no fundamental solution, prompt injection will remain an active threat and a real risk for organizations deploying AI assistants and agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-worn pattern in the development of AI chatbots. Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter ZombieAgent, son of ShadowLeak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user’s private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of attack has been demonstrated repeatedly against virtually all major large language models. One example was ShadowLeak, a data-exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT that Radware disclosed last September. It targeted Deep Research, a Chat-GPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI had introduced earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, OpenAI introduced mitigations that blocked the attack. With modest effort, however, Radware has found a bypass method that effectively revived ShadowLeak. The security firm has named the revised attack ZombieAgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fairness, OpenAI is hardly alone in this unending cycle of mitigating an attack only to see it revived through a simple change. If the past five years are any guide, this pattern is likely to endure indefinitely, in much the way SQL injection and memory corruption vulnerabilities continue to provide hackers with the fuel they need to compromise software and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Guardrails should not be considered fundamental solutions for the prompt injection problems,” Pascal Geenens, VP of threat intelligence at Radware, wrote in an email. “Instead, they are a quick fix to stop a specific attack. As long as there is no fundamental solution, prompt injection will remain an active threat and a real risk for organizations deploying AI assistants and agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on this week’s episode of the Equity podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies — like Tripadvisor or WebMD — will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&amp;amp;A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-has-to-change"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Social has to change”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with AI-generated Maduro slop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like Reddit and Digg make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-things-are-better-with-voice-than-a-screen"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Some things are better with voice than a screen&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047721" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta Ray-Ban display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta / Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Investment in consumer tech startups has been in a downturn since 2022, as a turbulent macroeconomic climate and rising inflation have made VCs skittish about consumer spending power.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk sued OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in 2024, alleging they betrayed their original contractual agreements by pursuing profits instead of the nonprofit’s founding mission to develop AI that benefits humanity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk, who has launched his own for-profit company xAI, was an early financial backer and co-founder of OpenAI. He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since leaving OpenAI, he’s been a vocal critic of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, first began to move away from its pure nonprofit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit, and in October 2025, the corporation completed its formal restructuring process. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original nonprofit retaining a 26% equity stake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe’s product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since raised nearly $500 million in venture capital from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake’s founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake’s board of directors since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a Snowflake blog post — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to reports, the deal is valued at around $1 billion, which would make it Snowflake’s largest acquisition to date, surpassing its $800 million purchase in March 2022 of Streamlit, an open source framework that allows developers and data scientists to quickly build and share data applications without needing expertise in front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Observe was most recently valued at $848 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook data. TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year saw a wave of consolidation in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026.

On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety &amp;amp; Nutrition Security in Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;The New Pyramid&amp;quot; showing an upside-down pyramid shape made of Protein, Dairy&amp;amp; Healthy Fats sharing the top with Vegetables &amp;amp; Fruits with Whole Grains at the bottom tip" class="wp-image-1130896" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-180634.png?w=2082" /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We've been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The chipmaker isn’t leaving any room for refunds or changes to orders, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While some customers may be allowed to use commercial insurance or asset collateral, the terms are far stricter than Nvidia’s earlier policies, which sometimes permitted partial deposits, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia declined to comment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;China is expected to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips in the country, per Bloomberg, though Beijing wants to prevent the chips from being used by its military, state-owned firms, and sensitive infrastructure concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the challenges, demand for Nvidia’s H200 remains strong, and Chinese companies have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million of the GPUs in 2026, prompting the chipmaker to ramp up production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia is trying to strike a careful balance between meeting strong demand for its chips while managing political risk in both the U.S. and China. The U.S. chipmaker suffered costly setbacks when the Trump administration said it would need a license to export its H20 chips to China, forcing the company to write down $5.5 billion worth of inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/h3&gt;
			
							
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;I stopped by the exhibit for Donut Lab, a startup out of Finland that specializes in electric mobility. The company (which gets its name from its flagship donut-shaped in-wheel EV vehicle motor) announced at CES the launch of what it calls the first solid-state battery for vehicle production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Solid-state batteries differ from lithium-ion batteries (which are used by a majority of EVs) in that they use solid rather than liquid electrolytes. They are supposed to offer much greater energy density (more bang for your buck, so to speak) and better safety, and they degrade less than lithium ion batteries. On top of all that, Donut says its battery can fully charge in a lean five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Charging times obviously differ between vehicles and models but five minutes is, you know, pretty damn fast. Donut claims that, with the long-range version of its battery, a rider can get up to 600 kilometers on a single charge. The company also says that its battery quashes many of the causes of battery fires, as the SSB remains stable across extreme temperatures and includes no flammable liquid. As a result, it’s also supposed to operate better in cold environments (chilly weather has been known to reduce the range capacity of many EVs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Donut is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles. Verge Motorcycle co-founder and former CTO Marko Lehtimaki is the co-founder and CEO of Donut Lab. Lehtimaki isn’t new to the startup scene. He has founded a number of companies, including no-code software startup AppGyver, which was acquired by SAP in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Donut’s new SSBs will be introduced to Verge’s motorcycles early this year, the companies said this week. The batteries will be incorporated into Verge’s Verge TS Pro and Verge TS Ultra. At its exhibit, the company showed off a number of other partner vehicles that will soon have the batteries incorporated into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-anime-companion-that-watches-you-from-your-desk-nbsp"&gt;An AI anime companion that watches you from your desk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Razer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cuddly-ai-baby-panda-robot-for-older-adults"&gt;A cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080424" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Panda-AnAN.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;AI Panda An’An rests by the window on the desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mind With Heart Robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-500-ice-cube-maker-that-uses-ai-to-reduce-noise"&gt;A $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080426" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/goveelife-smart-nugget-ice-maker.jpeg?w=660" width="660" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;GoveeLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ultrasonic-chef-s-knife-that-vibrates-when-slicing-and-dicing"&gt;An ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080427" height="436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ultrasonic-knife.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Seattle Ultrasonics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-musical-lollipop-that-plays-ice-spice-in-your-head"&gt;A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080428" height="305" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lollipop Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-wall-e-inspired-robot-patrols-your-home-and-can-also-join-you-on-camping-trips"&gt;This Wall-E-inspired robot patrols your home and can also join you on camping trips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080854" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/W1_robot.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Zeroth Robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zeroth Robotics introduced the W1 at CES, a robot reminiscent of WALL-E. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The W1 is a programmable companion designed for families. According to the company’s website, for $4,999, the robot offers round-the-clock AI-powered security, 360-degree mobile surveillance, and integrates with smart home devices for instant smoke and intrusion alerts. It’s also marketed as an adventure companion that can transport camping gear, follow you around the campsite taking photos as a family photographer, and supply portable power so you can enjoy entertainment on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the company hasn’t mentioned whether the robot can sort trash or retrieve trinkets—a missed opportunity, in our opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-egg-shaped-hormone-tracking-device"&gt;An egg-shaped hormone tracking device&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081243" height="573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mira-hormonedevice.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mira&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This egg-shaped device can assess your reproductive health hormones. All it needs is your urine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mira’s $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor enables convenient at-home testing: simply urinate on the wand and insert it into the device. The device analyzes your results and provides information about four reproductive hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG). Monitoring these hormones not only tells you your 6 fertile days, but also offers insights into conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sounds pretty egg-cellent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated after publication to include more weird gadgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While CES 2026 is full of tech giants unveiling their latest innovations, the real excitement comes from discovering unexpected, quirky gadgets that make you ask, “Who thought of this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-anime-companion-that-watches-you-from-your-desk-nbsp"&gt;An AI anime companion that watches you from your desk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Razer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cuddly-ai-baby-panda-robot-for-older-adults"&gt;A cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080424" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Panda-AnAN.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;AI Panda An’An rests by the window on the desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mind With Heart Robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-500-ice-cube-maker-that-uses-ai-to-reduce-noise"&gt;A $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080426" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/goveelife-smart-nugget-ice-maker.jpeg?w=660" width="660" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;GoveeLife&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ultrasonic-chef-s-knife-that-vibrates-when-slicing-and-dicing"&gt;An ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080427" height="436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ultrasonic-knife.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Seattle Ultrasonics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-musical-lollipop-that-plays-ice-spice-in-your-head"&gt;A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080428" height="305" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lollipop Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-wall-e-inspired-robot-patrols-your-home-and-can-also-join-you-on-camping-trips"&gt;This Wall-E-inspired robot patrols your home and can also join you on camping trips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3080854" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/W1_robot.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Zeroth Robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zeroth Robotics introduced the W1 at CES, a robot reminiscent of WALL-E. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The W1 is a programmable companion designed for families. According to the company’s website, for $4,999, the robot offers round-the-clock AI-powered security, 360-degree mobile surveillance, and integrates with smart home devices for instant smoke and intrusion alerts. It’s also marketed as an adventure companion that can transport camping gear, follow you around the campsite taking photos as a family photographer, and supply portable power so you can enjoy entertainment on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the company hasn’t mentioned whether the robot can sort trash or retrieve trinkets—a missed opportunity, in our opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-egg-shaped-hormone-tracking-device"&gt;An egg-shaped hormone tracking device&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3081243" height="573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mira-hormonedevice.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mira&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This egg-shaped device can assess your reproductive health hormones. All it needs is your urine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mira’s $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor enables convenient at-home testing: simply urinate on the wand and insert it into the device. The device analyzes your results and provides information about four reproductive hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG). Monitoring these hormones not only tells you your 6 fertile days, but also offers insights into conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sounds pretty egg-cellent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for “health and wellness conversations” intended to connect a user’s health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It’s a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI’s new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says more than 230 million people ask health questions on ChatGPT each week, making it one of the chatbot’s most common use cases. The company worked with more than 260 physicians over two years to develop ChatGPT Health and says conversations in the new section will not be used to train its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,” wrote Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But despite OpenAI’s talk of supporting health goals, the company’s terms of service directly state that ChatGPT and other OpenAI services “are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that policy is not changing with ChatGPT Health. OpenAI writes in its announcement, “Health is designed to support, not replace, medical care. It is not intended for diagnosis or treatment. Instead, it helps you navigate everyday questions and understand patterns over time—not just moments of illness—so you can feel more informed and prepared for important medical conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cautionary tale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFGate report on Sam Nelson’s death illustrates why maintaining that disclaimer legally matters. According to chat logs reviewed by the publication, Nelson first asked ChatGPT about recreational drug dosing in November 2023. The AI assistant initially refused and directed him to health care professionals. But over 18 months of conversations, ChatGPT’s responses reportedly shifted. Eventually, the chatbot told him things like “Hell yes—let’s go full trippy mode” and recommended he double his cough syrup intake. His mother found him dead from an overdose the day after he began addiction treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nelson’s case did not involve the analysis of doctor-sanctioned health care instructions like the type ChatGPT Health will link &lt;span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;to, his case is not unique, as many people have been&amp;nbsp;misled&amp;nbsp;by chatbots that provide inaccurate information or&amp;nbsp;encourage&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;dangerous behavior, as we have covered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because AI language models can easily confabulate, generating plausible but false information in a way that makes it difficult for some users to distinguish fact from fiction. The AI models that services like ChatGPT use statistical relationships in training data (like the text from books, YouTube transcripts, and websites) to produce plausible responses rather than necessarily accurate ones. Moreover, ChatGPT’s outputs can vary widely depending on who is using the chatbot and what has previously taken place in the user’s chat history (including notes about previous chats).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the issue of unreliable training data, which companies like OpenAI use to create the models. Fundamentally, all major AI language models rely on information pulled from sources of information collected online. Rob Eleveld of the AI regulatory watchdog Transparency Coalition told SFGate: “There is zero chance, zero chance, that the foundational models can ever be safe on this stuff. Because what they sucked in there is everything on the Internet. And everything on the Internet is all sorts of completely false crap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when summarizing a medical report or analyzing a test result, ChatGPT could make a mistake that the user, not being trained in medicine, would not be able to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these hazards, it’s likely that the quality of health-related chats with the AI bot can vary dramatically between users because ChatGPT’s output partially mirrors the style and tone of what users feed into the system. For example, anecdotally, some users claim to find ChatGPT useful for medical issues, though some successes for a few users who know how to navigate the bot’s hazards do not necessarily mean that relying on a chatbot for medical analysis is wise for the general public. That’s doubly true in the absence of government regulation and safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to SFGate, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood called Nelson’s death “a heartbreaking situation” and said the company’s models are designed to respond to sensitive questions “with care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Health is rolling out to a waitlist of US users, with broader access planned in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for “health and wellness conversations” intended to connect a user’s health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It’s a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI’s new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says more than 230 million people ask health questions on ChatGPT each week, making it one of the chatbot’s most common use cases. The company worked with more than 260 physicians over two years to develop ChatGPT Health and says conversations in the new section will not be used to train its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,” wrote Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But despite OpenAI’s talk of supporting health goals, the company’s terms of service directly state that ChatGPT and other OpenAI services “are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that policy is not changing with ChatGPT Health. OpenAI writes in its announcement, “Health is designed to support, not replace, medical care. It is not intended for diagnosis or treatment. Instead, it helps you navigate everyday questions and understand patterns over time—not just moments of illness—so you can feel more informed and prepared for important medical conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cautionary tale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFGate report on Sam Nelson’s death illustrates why maintaining that disclaimer legally matters. According to chat logs reviewed by the publication, Nelson first asked ChatGPT about recreational drug dosing in November 2023. The AI assistant initially refused and directed him to health care professionals. But over 18 months of conversations, ChatGPT’s responses reportedly shifted. Eventually, the chatbot told him things like “Hell yes—let’s go full trippy mode” and recommended he double his cough syrup intake. His mother found him dead from an overdose the day after he began addiction treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nelson’s case did not involve the analysis of doctor-sanctioned health care instructions like the type ChatGPT Health will link &lt;span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;to, his case is not unique, as many people have been&amp;nbsp;misled&amp;nbsp;by chatbots that provide inaccurate information or&amp;nbsp;encourage&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;dangerous behavior, as we have covered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because AI language models can easily confabulate, generating plausible but false information in a way that makes it difficult for some users to distinguish fact from fiction. The AI models that services like ChatGPT use statistical relationships in training data (like the text from books, YouTube transcripts, and websites) to produce plausible responses rather than necessarily accurate ones. Moreover, ChatGPT’s outputs can vary widely depending on who is using the chatbot and what has previously taken place in the user’s chat history (including notes about previous chats).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the issue of unreliable training data, which companies like OpenAI use to create the models. Fundamentally, all major AI language models rely on information pulled from sources of information collected online. Rob Eleveld of the AI regulatory watchdog Transparency Coalition told SFGate: “There is zero chance, zero chance, that the foundational models can ever be safe on this stuff. Because what they sucked in there is everything on the Internet. And everything on the Internet is all sorts of completely false crap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when summarizing a medical report or analyzing a test result, ChatGPT could make a mistake that the user, not being trained in medicine, would not be able to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these hazards, it’s likely that the quality of health-related chats with the AI bot can vary dramatically between users because ChatGPT’s output partially mirrors the style and tone of what users feed into the system. For example, anecdotally, some users claim to find ChatGPT useful for medical issues, though some successes for a few users who know how to navigate the bot’s hazards do not necessarily mean that relying on a chatbot for medical analysis is wise for the general public. That’s doubly true in the absence of government regulation and safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to SFGate, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood called Nelson’s death “a heartbreaking situation” and said the company’s models are designed to respond to sensitive questions “with care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Health is rolling out to a waitlist of US users, with broader access planned in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders – Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett – will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Convogo’s product will be wound down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real world outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem – as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm – or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI – as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
