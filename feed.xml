          &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the center of a service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already seen at least two production outages [in the past few months],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI [agent] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS, which accounts for 60 percent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS outage in October 2025 that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline—including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected—a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding”—which allows users to quickly build applications—to instead write code based on a set of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Amazon employees said they were still skeptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 percent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards,” including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-founders-vcs-and-operators-keep-coming-back-to-disrupt"&gt;Why founders, VCs, and operators keep coming back to Disrupt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From October 13–15, San Francisco’s Moscone West will become the global epicenter of tech. Disrupt is a curated, three-day experience built to maximize signal over noise — bringing together 10,000 founders, investors, operators, and tech leaders for 200+ expert-led sessions featuring 250+ influential voices.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Across the ecosystem, past attendees consistently point to the same value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Real access to founders, investors, and operators who are actively building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Conversations that turn into partnerships, funding, and&amp;nbsp;key&amp;nbsp;hires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Practical insights you can apply&amp;nbsp;immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;

The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1244449349.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Peak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds.

Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mom?” he asks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is the opening of “Murmuray,” a short film by independent filmmaker Brad Tangonan. Everything about this film felt like his previous work, from the tactile nature shots to the dreamlike desaturated highlights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The only difference? He made it using AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan was one of 10 filmmakers to participate in Google Flow Sessions, a five-week cohort that gave creatives access to Google’s suite of AI tools to produce short films, including Gemini, image generator Nano Banana Pro, and film generator Veo.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each film differed in scope. Hal Watmough’s “You’ve Been Here Before” blended hyperreal, lifelike visuals with cartoonish stylization to playfully explore the importance of a morning routine, while Tabitha Swanson’s “The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity” is a more esoteric, philosophical conversation about our relationship with AI and ourselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None of these short films, which were screened at Soho House New York late last year, felt like AI slop. Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit — they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: What kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-is-it-slop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it slop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094472" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Keenan MacWilliam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said last October that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent CBS interview the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “Mimesis,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses, and swam away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna — she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event — the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “Melongray” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-to-be-efficient-or-not-to-be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be [efficient] or not to be&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today’s film studio budgets are being squeezed by rising filming costs, the pivot to streaming, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original mid-budget movies have all but been abandoned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barriers and make it easier for film studios to produce original work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films — expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowered-and-isolated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowered and isolated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094473" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Hal Watmough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I know I’m a one-man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer — roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised a $900 million Series C, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If artists don’t define AI, studios will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup Runway has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, while others — including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI — have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like Moonvalley’s Marey, are trained only on openly licensed data.) Then there are the environmental horrors — some estimates suggest generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee-jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A Filipino man walks through the backyard of his childhood home in rural Hawai’i, his footsteps swooshing through the grass. Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mom?” he asks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-is-it-slop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it slop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094472" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Keenan MacWilliam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “Mimesis,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowered-and-isolated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowered and isolated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3094473" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Hal Watmough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I know I’m a one-man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer — roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised a $900 million Series C, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If artists don’t define AI, studios will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup Runway has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, while others — including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI — have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like Moonvalley’s Marey, are trained only on openly licensed data.) Then there are the environmental horrors — some estimates suggest generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee-jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No one could have predicted that over 30 years later, Pixar would still be making Toy Story movies, nor could anyone have known that the latest installation in the franchise would pit Buzz Lightyear and a balding Woody against an evil AI tablet called Lilypad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But sure enough, “Toy Story 5” confronts old-school toys like Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and Slinky Dog against the sinister threat of &lt;em&gt;technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trailer shows Bonnie, the young girl who inherited Andy’s toys when he left for college in “Toy Story 2,” playing outside with her toys when a surprise package with the Lilypad tablet arrives for her. She becomes completely enraptured by the tablet, not even looking up from the screen when her parents tell her that screen time is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The “Toy Story 5” trailer makes the Lilypad — or, Lily — out to be a sinister villain. When Jessie confronts the tablet about Bonnie’s well-being, Lily seems not to be paying attention, so the cowgirl demands that the tablet listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m always listening,” Lily says ominously, regurgitating Jessie’s impassioned speech in a computerized tone… and then translates it into Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Tech’s invaded our house,” Jessie tells Woody. “I’m losing Bonnie to this device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Woody replies, “Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

A Q4 2025 survey by GlobalData found that 45 percent of consumers in Asia and Australasia are very or quite likely to purchase a product based on AI recommendations or endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaya Dandey, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, said: “Whether shoppers realise it or not, machine-learning systems have long been deciding when to encourage consumers to make purchases, which products they can see, and what discounts they can avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, agentic systems can also complete shopping-related tasks end-to-end.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-computer-vision-and-store-automation"&gt;Computer vision and store automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises evaluating computer vision and machine learning can observe early implementations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson, for example, introduced AI-enabled ‘Lawson Go’ stores in Japan during 2022. The retailer collaborated with technology provider CloudPick in 2025 to integrate AI, machine learning, and computer vision. This integration eliminates check-out lines and cashiers to enhance the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, retail AI company Fainders.AI launched a compact and cashier-less MicroStore inside a gym in 2024. This deployment improved the accessibility of autonomous retail across different businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI also aids the forecasting and automation of retail replenishment—a capability that applies well to the APAC market, where store footprints are small and replenishment frequency is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese food retail chain Coop Sapporo uses a camera-based AI system named Sora-cam, developed by Soracom. The system helps the chain avoid overstocking and reduce unsold merchandise on store shelves. Coop Sapporo employs an analytics team to evaluate the generated images. The team determines the optimal shelf display ratio. The Sora-cam system also alerts staff members to apply discount labels on food items close to expiry to prevent wastage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models track waste and markdown timing while improving promotion efficiency. In Southeast Asian (SEA) markets characterised by high price sensitivity, minor improvements in promotion efficiency increase profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven labour optimisation measures include scheduling, task priority lists, and workload balancing. These measures assist retailers in Japan and South Korea, which face structural labour shortages. They also provide efficiency benefits in high-growth SEA markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agentic-ai-systems-in-retail-are-improving-apac-consumer-interaction"&gt;Agentic AI systems in retail are improving APAC consumer interaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In food retail, agentic AI is best understood as an AI ‘operator’ that can understand a goal, plan steps, stay within budget or allergen constraints, execute actions across systems, ask clarifying questions, and learn preferences over time,” says Dandey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can bypass individual item searches by outlining their overall intent. A customer, for example, might request an AI agent to “Plan five dinners for a family of four, mostly Asian recipes, no shellfish, under 45 minutes.” The agent then generates recipes, builds a shopping cart, sizes quantities, and adds missing staples to the cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retail agentic AI capability aligns with regional behaviours, as many APAC households cook frequently and shop fresh. AI agents that recognise local cuisines – such as Korean banchan, Japanese bentos, and Indian spice bases – fit regional habits better than generic Western meal plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many APAC markets, shopping is already deeply integrated with digital wallets, messaging apps, ride-hailing, and delivery ecosystems, making it easier for agentic AI to plug into daily routines,” explains Dandey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, some key challenges need to be overcome; ensuring private data sharing consent, minimising hallucinations in terms of allergens and ingredients, and implementing proper localisation of the system with language nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBS pilots system that lets AI agents make payments for customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111908" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.&lt;/p&gt;

Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/In-scope.jpg?resize=1200,1012" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Even without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes as India has become a key battleground for generative AI adoption. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ChatGPT has more than 100 million weekly active users in India, while Anthropic said India accounts for 5.8% of total Claude usage, second only to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indus serves as a chat interface for its newly announced Sarvam 105B model, the company’s 105-billion-parameter large language model. The app’s launch comes two days after Bengaluru-based Sarvam unveiled its 105B and 30B models at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi earlier this week. At the summit, the startup also outlined enterprise initiatives and hardware plans and announced partnerships with companies including HMD to bring AI to Nokia feature phones and Bosch for AI-enabled automotive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently available in beta on iOS, Android, and the web, the Indus app allows users to type or speak queries and receive responses in text and audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google account, or Apple ID, though the service appears to be limited to India for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095095" height="1007" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/saram-chat-app.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app currently comes with some limitations. Users cannot delete their chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning feature, which can sometimes slow response times. Sarvam has also warned that access may be restricted as it gradually expands its compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first. We will expand access over time,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar wrote on X, adding that the company is seeking feedback from users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners, and Khosla Ventures as it builds large language models tailored for India.&lt;/p&gt;
