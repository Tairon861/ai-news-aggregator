&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI's previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them. The new model represents what OpenAI describes as its "GPT-3.5 moment for video," comparing it to the ChatGPT breakthrough during the evolution of its text-generation models over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sora 2 appears to demonstrate improved physical accuracy over the original Sora model from February 2024, with OpenAI claiming the model can now simulate complex physical movements like Olympic gymnastics routines and triple axels while maintaining realistic physics. Last year, shortly after the launch of Sora 1 Turbo, we saw several notable failures of similar video-generation tasks that OpenAI claims to have addressed with the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt," OpenAI wrote in its announcement. "For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven't had a chance to evaluate Sora 2 yet, but we will likely test it in a future article. Past experience with video-synthesis models suggests caution about claims of building "world models" that accurately model physics. Despite marketing language about modeling reality, these remain Transformer-based AI models that fundamentally work by pattern-matching training examples to produce outputs, however novel those outputs may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with enough video examples and high-quality training techniques, a video-synthesis model can likely build what we once called an "illusion of understanding" that is convincing enough to visually simulate a large portion of reality in various situations without actually "understanding" physics, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI itself acknowledges that Sora 2 "makes plenty of mistakes" but views the model as validation that scaling neural networks on video data will bring the company closer to its goal of simulating reality. The company positions Sora 2 as progress toward "general-purpose world simulators and robotic agents" that it believes will "fundamentally reshape society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different approach to social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from visual and auditory upgrades, OpenAI is taking another big step away from its AI research lab pedigree toward making the new model available to average people in an easy-to-use way. It's doing it by packaging Sora 2 into a social iOS app that focuses on creating and sharing AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That new iOS app has already launched in the US and Canada as an invite-based rollout, with plans to expand to additional countries. Users can sign up in the app for notifications when access becomes available for their account. The service will initially be free with what OpenAI describes as "generous limits," though the company plans to offer paid options for additional generations when demand exceeds available compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the app, users can create videos, remix content from other users, and browse a customizable feed of generated videos. As mentioned above, the app's Cameo feature allows users to essentially deepfake themselves by recording a one-time video and audio capture, which the model can then insert into any Sora-generated scene.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the basic Sora 2 model on the website and in the app, ChatGPT Pro subscribers will gain access to Sora 2 Pro, described as an experimental higher-quality model. OpenAI also plans to release Sora 2 through its API for developers. The older Sora 1 Turbo model will remain available, and existing creations will stay in users' Sora libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what could go wrong with an app that can easily put people into AI-generated videos? Well, just about everything. Battling misuse is likely going to be a tricky issue for the company. In the recent past, we've seen instances of AI deepfaking (not related to OpenAI) without consent that have led to bullying lawsuits, criminal penalties, and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is taking precautions. Given recently prominent corporate sensitivities following a ChatGPT user's suicide, OpenAI says Sora 2 includes specific protections for teenage users. Those include default daily-generation limits and strict permissions for the cameos feature. OpenAI says it has deployed both automated safety systems and human moderators to review potential cases of bullying or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, OpenAI has built in layers of security for the cameos feature. It says that users can maintain control over their uploaded likeness: They can decide who can use their cameo in videos and can revoke access or remove videos containing their likeness at any time. Users can also view all videos containing their cameo, including drafts created by other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond deepfakes, the new Sora app has another hurdle to clear. These days, social media is often seen as less than a positive thing due to its perceived broad effects on society. Perhaps reacting to this stigma, OpenAI claims it has designed the new app to avoid common social media pitfalls like doomscrolling and addiction with what it calls a "new class of recommender algorithms" that users can control through natural language instructions, rather than relying on traditional engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption," OpenAI stated in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

The new model represents what OpenAI describes as its "GPT-3.5 moment for video," comparing it to the ChatGPT breakthrough during the evolution of its text-generation models over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sora 2 appears to demonstrate improved physical accuracy over the original Sora model from February 2024, with OpenAI claiming the model can now simulate complex physical movements like Olympic gymnastics routines and triple axels while maintaining realistic physics. Last year, shortly after the launch of Sora 1 Turbo, we saw several notable failures of similar video-generation tasks that OpenAI claims to have addressed with the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt," OpenAI wrote in its announcement. "For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven't had a chance to evaluate Sora 2 yet, but we will likely test it in a future article. Past experience with video-synthesis models suggests caution about claims of building "world models" that accurately model physics. Despite marketing language about modeling reality, these remain Transformer-based AI models that fundamentally work by pattern-matching training examples to produce outputs, however novel those outputs may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with enough video examples and high-quality training techniques, a video-synthesis model can likely build what we once called an "illusion of understanding" that is convincing enough to visually simulate a large portion of reality in various situations without actually "understanding" physics, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI itself acknowledges that Sora 2 "makes plenty of mistakes" but views the model as validation that scaling neural networks on video data will bring the company closer to its goal of simulating reality. The company positions Sora 2 as progress toward "general-purpose world simulators and robotic agents" that it believes will "fundamentally reshape society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different approach to social media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from visual and auditory upgrades, OpenAI is taking another big step away from its AI research lab pedigree toward making the new model available to average people in an easy-to-use way. It's doing it by packaging Sora 2 into a social iOS app that focuses on creating and sharing AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That new iOS app has already launched in the US and Canada as an invite-based rollout, with plans to expand to additional countries. Users can sign up in the app for notifications when access becomes available for their account. The service will initially be free with what OpenAI describes as "generous limits," though the company plans to offer paid options for additional generations when demand exceeds available compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the app, users can create videos, remix content from other users, and browse a customizable feed of generated videos. As mentioned above, the app's Cameo feature allows users to essentially deepfake themselves by recording a one-time video and audio capture, which the model can then insert into any Sora-generated scene.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the basic Sora 2 model on the website and in the app, ChatGPT Pro subscribers will gain access to Sora 2 Pro, described as an experimental higher-quality model. OpenAI also plans to release Sora 2 through its API for developers. The older Sora 1 Turbo model will remain available, and existing creations will stay in users' Sora libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what could go wrong with an app that can easily put people into AI-generated videos? Well, just about everything. Battling misuse is likely going to be a tricky issue for the company. In the recent past, we've seen instances of AI deepfaking (not related to OpenAI) without consent that have led to bullying lawsuits, criminal penalties, and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is taking precautions. Given recently prominent corporate sensitivities following a ChatGPT user's suicide, OpenAI says Sora 2 includes specific protections for teenage users. Those include default daily-generation limits and strict permissions for the cameos feature. OpenAI says it has deployed both automated safety systems and human moderators to review potential cases of bullying or misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, OpenAI has built in layers of security for the cameos feature. It says that users can maintain control over their uploaded likeness: They can decide who can use their cameo in videos and can revoke access or remove videos containing their likeness at any time. Users can also view all videos containing their cameo, including drafts created by other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond deepfakes, the new Sora app has another hurdle to clear. These days, social media is often seen as less than a positive thing due to its perceived broad effects on society. Perhaps reacting to this stigma, OpenAI claims it has designed the new app to avoid common social media pitfalls like doomscrolling and addiction with what it calls a "new class of recommender algorithms" that users can control through natural language instructions, rather than relying on traditional engagement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption," OpenAI stated in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

Gavin Newsom signed into law this week, is proof that state regulation&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;have to hinder AI progress.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So says&amp;nbsp;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy at youth-led advocacy group Encode AI,&amp;nbsp;on today’s episode of Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reality is that policy makers themselves know that we have to do something, and they know from working on a million other issues that there is a way to pass legislation that genuinely does protect innovation&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;which I do care about&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;while making sure that these products are safe,” Billen told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core,&amp;nbsp;SB&amp;nbsp;53 is a&amp;nbsp;first-in-the-nation bill&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety and security protocols&amp;nbsp;— specifically around how they prevent their models from catastrophic risks, like being used to commit&amp;nbsp;cyberattacks&amp;nbsp;on critical infrastructure or build&amp;nbsp;bio-weapons.&amp;nbsp;The law also mandates that companies stick to those protocols, which will be enforced by the Office of Emergency Services.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Companies are already doing the stuff that we ask them to do in this bill,” Billen&amp;nbsp;told TechCrunch. “They do safety testing on their models. They release model cards. Are they starting to skimp in some areas at some companies? Yes. And that’s why bills like this are important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen also noted that&amp;nbsp;some AI firms have a policy around relaxing safety standards under competitive pressure. OpenAI, for example, has&amp;nbsp;publicly stated&amp;nbsp;that it&amp;nbsp;may “adjust” its safety requirements&amp;nbsp;if a rival AI lab releases a high-risk system without similar safeguards.&amp;nbsp;Billen argues that policy can enforce companies’ existing safety promises, preventing them from cutting corners under competitive or financial pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While public opposition to SB 53 was muted in&amp;nbsp;comparison to its predecessor SB 1047, which&amp;nbsp;Newsom vetoed last year, the rhetoric in Silicon Valley and among most AI labs has been that almost any&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;regulation is anathema to progress and will&amp;nbsp;ultimately hinder&amp;nbsp;the U.S. in its race to beat China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s why companies like Meta, VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, and powerful individuals like OpenAI president Greg Brockman are collectively pumping hundreds of millions into super PACs to back pro-AI politicians in state elections. And&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;why those same forces earlier this year pushed for an&amp;nbsp;AI moratorium&amp;nbsp;that would have banned states from regulating AI for 10 years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Encode AI ran a coalition of more than 200 organizations to work to&amp;nbsp;strike down the proposal, but Billen says the fight&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;over. Senator Ted Cruz, who championed the moratorium, is&amp;nbsp;attempting&amp;nbsp;a new strategy to achieve the same goal of federal preemption of state laws. In September, Cruz introduced the&amp;nbsp;SANDBOX Act, which would allow AI companies to apply for waivers to temporarily bypass certain federal regulations for up to 10 years. Billen also anticipates a forthcoming bill establishing a federal AI standard&amp;nbsp;that would be pitched as a middle-ground&amp;nbsp;solution but&amp;nbsp;would in reality&amp;nbsp;override state laws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He warned that narrowly scoped&amp;nbsp;federal AI legislation could “delete federalism for the most important technology of our time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you told me SB 53 was the bill that would replace all the state bills on everything related to AI and all of the potential risks, I would tell you that’s probably not a very good idea and that this bill is designed for a particular subset of things,” Billen said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053195" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adam-billen-headshot.jpg?w=624" width="624" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy, Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While he agrees that the AI race with China matters, and that policymakers need to enact regulation that will support American progress, he says killing state bills&amp;nbsp;— which&amp;nbsp;mainly focus on deepfakes, transparency, algorithmic discrimination, children’s safety, and governmental use of AI — isn’t the way to go about doing that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Are bills like SB 53 the thing that will stop us from beating China? No,” he said. “I think it&amp;nbsp;is just genuinely intellectually dishonest to say that that is the thing that will stop us in the race.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added:&amp;nbsp;“If the thing you care about is beating China in the race on AI — and I do care about that — then the things you would push for are stuff like export controls in Congress,” Billen said. “You would make sure that American companies have the&amp;nbsp;chips. But&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;not what the industry is pushing for.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Legislative proposals like the&amp;nbsp;Chip Security Act&amp;nbsp;aim to prevent the diversion of advanced AI chips to China through export controls and tracking devices, and the existing&amp;nbsp;CHIPS and Science Act&amp;nbsp;seeks&amp;nbsp;to boost domestic chip production. However, some major tech companies, including OpenAI and Nvidia, have expressed reluctance or&amp;nbsp;opposition&amp;nbsp;to certain aspects of these efforts, citing concerns about effectiveness, competitiveness, and security vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has its reasons — it has a strong financial incentive to continue selling chips to China, which has historically&amp;nbsp;represented&amp;nbsp;a significant portion&amp;nbsp;of its global revenue.&amp;nbsp;Billen&amp;nbsp;speculated&amp;nbsp;that OpenAI could hold back on chip export advocacy to stay in the good graces of crucial suppliers like Nvidia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s&amp;nbsp;also been inconsistent messaging from&amp;nbsp;the Trump administration. Three months after expanding an export ban&amp;nbsp;on advanced AI chips to China&amp;nbsp;in April 2025, the administration reversed course, allowing&amp;nbsp;Nvidia and AMD to sell some chips to China in&amp;nbsp;exchange for 15% of the revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You see people on the Hill moving towards bills like the Chip Security Act that would put export controls on China,” Billen said. “In the meantime,&amp;nbsp;there’s going to continue to be this propping up&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the narrative to kill state bills that are&amp;nbsp;actually quite&amp;nbsp;light tough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen&amp;nbsp;added&amp;nbsp;that SB 53 is an example of democracy in action — of industry and policymakers working together to get to a version of a bill that everyone can agree on.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;“very ugly and messy,” but “that process of democracy and federalism is the entire foundation of our country and our economic system, and I hope that we will keep doing that successfully.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think SB 53 is one of the best proof points that that can still work,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;SB 53, the AI&amp;nbsp;safety&amp;nbsp;and transparency&amp;nbsp;bill&amp;nbsp;that California&amp;nbsp;Gov.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its core,&amp;nbsp;SB&amp;nbsp;53 is a&amp;nbsp;first-in-the-nation bill&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety and security protocols&amp;nbsp;— specifically around how they prevent their models from catastrophic risks, like being used to commit&amp;nbsp;cyberattacks&amp;nbsp;on critical infrastructure or build&amp;nbsp;bio-weapons.&amp;nbsp;The law also mandates that companies stick to those protocols, which will be enforced by the Office of Emergency Services.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Companies are already doing the stuff that we ask them to do in this bill,” Billen&amp;nbsp;told TechCrunch. “They do safety testing on their models. They release model cards. Are they starting to skimp in some areas at some companies? Yes. And that’s why bills like this are important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen also noted that&amp;nbsp;some AI firms have a policy around relaxing safety standards under competitive pressure. OpenAI, for example, has&amp;nbsp;publicly stated&amp;nbsp;that it&amp;nbsp;may “adjust” its safety requirements&amp;nbsp;if a rival AI lab releases a high-risk system without similar safeguards.&amp;nbsp;Billen argues that policy can enforce companies’ existing safety promises, preventing them from cutting corners under competitive or financial pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While public opposition to SB 53 was muted in&amp;nbsp;comparison to its predecessor SB 1047, which&amp;nbsp;Newsom vetoed last year, the rhetoric in Silicon Valley and among most AI labs has been that almost any&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;regulation is anathema to progress and will&amp;nbsp;ultimately hinder&amp;nbsp;the U.S. in its race to beat China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s why companies like Meta, VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, and powerful individuals like OpenAI president Greg Brockman are collectively pumping hundreds of millions into super PACs to back pro-AI politicians in state elections. And&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;why those same forces earlier this year pushed for an&amp;nbsp;AI moratorium&amp;nbsp;that would have banned states from regulating AI for 10 years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Encode AI ran a coalition of more than 200 organizations to work to&amp;nbsp;strike down the proposal, but Billen says the fight&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;over. Senator Ted Cruz, who championed the moratorium, is&amp;nbsp;attempting&amp;nbsp;a new strategy to achieve the same goal of federal preemption of state laws. In September, Cruz introduced the&amp;nbsp;SANDBOX Act, which would allow AI companies to apply for waivers to temporarily bypass certain federal regulations for up to 10 years. Billen also anticipates a forthcoming bill establishing a federal AI standard&amp;nbsp;that would be pitched as a middle-ground&amp;nbsp;solution but&amp;nbsp;would in reality&amp;nbsp;override state laws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He warned that narrowly scoped&amp;nbsp;federal AI legislation could “delete federalism for the most important technology of our time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you told me SB 53 was the bill that would replace all the state bills on everything related to AI and all of the potential risks, I would tell you that’s probably not a very good idea and that this bill is designed for a particular subset of things,” Billen said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3053195" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adam-billen-headshot.jpg?w=624" width="624" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Adam Billen, vice president of public policy, Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Encode AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While he agrees that the AI race with China matters, and that policymakers need to enact regulation that will support American progress, he says killing state bills&amp;nbsp;— which&amp;nbsp;mainly focus on deepfakes, transparency, algorithmic discrimination, children’s safety, and governmental use of AI — isn’t the way to go about doing that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Are bills like SB 53 the thing that will stop us from beating China? No,” he said. “I think it&amp;nbsp;is just genuinely intellectually dishonest to say that that is the thing that will stop us in the race.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added:&amp;nbsp;“If the thing you care about is beating China in the race on AI — and I do care about that — then the things you would push for are stuff like export controls in Congress,” Billen said. “You would make sure that American companies have the&amp;nbsp;chips. But&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;not what the industry is pushing for.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Legislative proposals like the&amp;nbsp;Chip Security Act&amp;nbsp;aim to prevent the diversion of advanced AI chips to China through export controls and tracking devices, and the existing&amp;nbsp;CHIPS and Science Act&amp;nbsp;seeks&amp;nbsp;to boost domestic chip production. However, some major tech companies, including OpenAI and Nvidia, have expressed reluctance or&amp;nbsp;opposition&amp;nbsp;to certain aspects of these efforts, citing concerns about effectiveness, competitiveness, and security vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has its reasons — it has a strong financial incentive to continue selling chips to China, which has historically&amp;nbsp;represented&amp;nbsp;a significant portion&amp;nbsp;of its global revenue.&amp;nbsp;Billen&amp;nbsp;speculated&amp;nbsp;that OpenAI could hold back on chip export advocacy to stay in the good graces of crucial suppliers like Nvidia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s&amp;nbsp;also been inconsistent messaging from&amp;nbsp;the Trump administration. Three months after expanding an export ban&amp;nbsp;on advanced AI chips to China&amp;nbsp;in April 2025, the administration reversed course, allowing&amp;nbsp;Nvidia and AMD to sell some chips to China in&amp;nbsp;exchange for 15% of the revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You see people on the Hill moving towards bills like the Chip Security Act that would put export controls on China,” Billen said. “In the meantime,&amp;nbsp;there’s going to continue to be this propping up&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the narrative to kill state bills that are&amp;nbsp;actually quite&amp;nbsp;light tough.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Billen&amp;nbsp;added&amp;nbsp;that SB 53 is an example of democracy in action — of industry and policymakers working together to get to a version of a bill that everyone can agree on.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;“very ugly and messy,” but “that process of democracy and federalism is the entire foundation of our country and our economic system, and I hope that we will keep doing that successfully.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think SB 53 is one of the best proof points that that can still work,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/californias-new-ai-safety-law-shows-regulation-and-innovation-dont-have-to-clash/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Roundtables: Trump’s Impact on the Next Generation of Innovators (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/01/1124062/roundtables-trumps-impact-on-the-next-generation-of-innovators/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MITTR-Roundtables-3-Zoom-Opening-Overlay.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contentBody__summaryBullets--81327c9379272772d1e74a64b6d4868a"&gt;&lt;div class="contentBody__summaryBullets--81327c9379272772d1e74a64b6d4868a"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA AI Days — hosted for and in different pockets of the world — are drawing in hundreds of enthusiasts, developers, researchers and startups to discuss and explore the latest technologies making AI breakthroughs possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest stop: Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 900 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo to learn about sovereign AI — including two-dozen breakout sections on agentic and physical AI, quantum computing and AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Cloud Partners SoftBank, GMO Internet and KDDI&amp;nbsp;each introduced the latest advancements to their AI factories and showcased how they’re supporting developers to build AI models and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp., said at the event. “To ensure transparency and safety as AI adoption expands, it is crucial to build a foundation of domestic technologies — high performance, Japan-made large language models and large-scale domestic computing infrastructure capable of continuous LLM development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” said Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/suzuki-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government is placing AI at the core of its national strategy. Last year, it announced a goal to invest at least 10 trillion yen — about $65 billion — through fiscal year 2030 to boost the semiconductor and AI industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, evangelist of AI at NEC, a leader in IT and network technologies. “We are certain that LLMs such as NEC cotomi enable professional employees’ knowledge transfer or utilizing complex enterprise documents, directly addressing the skill gap and labor shortages that Japan is facing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, AI evangelist at NEC." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ishikawa-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, Japan’s GENIAC initiative aims to strengthen domestic generative AI capabilities by providing companies with computing resources, fostering collaboration and supporting foundation model development — including LLMs tuned for the Japanese language and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key players driving AI industry trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Infographic that says there are: 281,000 Japan-based NVIDIA Developer Program members, 400 NVIDIA Inception startups in Japan, six major cloud leaders with NVIDIA-powered AI factories in Japan and 29,000 NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute enrollments in Japan." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tokyo-infographic-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Industry in Motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan-based NVIDIA partners are advancing the nation’s role in the next industrial revolution fueled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Inception members unveiled innovative services developed using the NVIDIA NeMo software suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Stockmark announced the release of its 100-billion-parameter full-scratch Japanese LLM as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, offering 2.5x faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And FastLabel launched FastLabel Data Curation, a solution for developing autonomous-driving capabilities and advanced driver-assistance systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Hakuhodo Technologies, a service company of Japan’s major ad agency Hakuhodo, announced it will use NVIDIA AI Blueprints and the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit to develop AI agents for autonomously producing advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimizu Corporation, a leading general contractor with over 200 years of history in Japan, revealed how it is exploring the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization to monitor work progress and potential risks at construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an NVIDIA session at AI Day Tokyo highlighted the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan, the first open synthetic dataset aligned with Japan’s real-world demographic, geographic and cultural distributions. The dataset provides a privacy-preserving, regulation-ready foundation for sovereign AI systems to reflect Japanese society without relying on sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Atsunori Fujita, senior solution architect at NVIDIA Japan, introduces the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan dataset." class="full-width-layout__image" height="1334" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nemotron-personas-japan.jpeg" width="1999" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By leveraging advanced methodologies and accelerated computing, developers and businesses in Japan can empower AI agents to maximize enterprise data usage, drive organizational efficiency and achieve continuous innovation,” said Bartley Richardson, senior director of engineering at NVIDIA, who provided an overview of agentic AI at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Other Event Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special “Japan Healthcare Day” provided deep dives into NVIDIA’s healthcare technologies for developers and researchers from Japan’s medtech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four sessions covered how the open-source MONAI framework, along with the NVIDIA Holoscan and NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare platforms, are accelerating the development of cutting-edge medical devices and digital health tools with agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training workshops from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute covered building AI agents with retrieval-augmented generation capabilities using LLMs and an introduction to the NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model platform for physical AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event also included a meetup where startups from the NVIDIA Inception program met with NVIDIA Cloud Partners to identify suitable partners for their developer environment. The startups also connected with venture capital companies.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on its strength in engineering and mechatronics, Japan is poised to drive a new era where advanced digital agents capable of planning, reasoning and collaborating will become digital workers to execute complex tasks alongside physical AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical AI lets autonomous systems like cameras, robots and self-driving cars perceive, understand, reason and perform or orchestrate complex actions in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical AI track at AI Day Tokyo provided insights on technologies such as NVIDIA Omniverse for digital twins, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T for humanoid robotics development and NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: NVIDIA AI Day Sydney, running Oct. 15-16, where attendees can learn about the latest AI breakthroughs, connect with peers and experts, and contribute to the next wave of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Explore more content from &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;AI Days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; around the globe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Attendees check in at NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo.		&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 900 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day Tokyo to learn about sovereign AI — including two-dozen breakout sections on agentic and physical AI, quantum computing and AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Cloud Partners SoftBank, GMO Internet and KDDI&amp;nbsp;each introduced the latest advancements to their AI factories and showcased how they’re supporting developers to build AI models and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp., said at the event. “To ensure transparency and safety as AI adoption expands, it is crucial to build a foundation of domestic technologies — high performance, Japan-made large language models and large-scale domestic computing infrastructure capable of continuous LLM development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Japan will see a 320x increase from 2020 in demand for AI computing power by 2030,” said Kuniyoshi Suzuki, senior director of the cloud AI service division at SoftBank Corp." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/suzuki-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government is placing AI at the core of its national strategy. Last year, it announced a goal to invest at least 10 trillion yen — about $65 billion — through fiscal year 2030 to boost the semiconductor and AI industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, evangelist of AI at NEC, a leader in IT and network technologies. “We are certain that LLMs such as NEC cotomi enable professional employees’ knowledge transfer or utilizing complex enterprise documents, directly addressing the skill gap and labor shortages that Japan is facing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Specialized AI for industries like manufacturing, finance and healthcare will drive Japan’s digital transformation,” said Kazuya Ishikawa, AI evangelist at NEC." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ishikawa-pull-quote-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, Japan’s GENIAC initiative aims to strengthen domestic generative AI capabilities by providing companies with computing resources, fostering collaboration and supporting foundation model development — including LLMs tuned for the Japanese language and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key players driving AI industry trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Infographic that says there are: 281,000 Japan-based NVIDIA Developer Program members, 400 NVIDIA Inception startups in Japan, six major cloud leaders with NVIDIA-powered AI factories in Japan and 29,000 NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute enrollments in Japan." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tokyo-infographic-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Industry in Motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan-based NVIDIA partners are advancing the nation’s role in the next industrial revolution fueled by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Inception members unveiled innovative services developed using the NVIDIA NeMo software suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Stockmark announced the release of its 100-billion-parameter full-scratch Japanese LLM as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, offering 2.5x faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And FastLabel launched FastLabel Data Curation, a solution for developing autonomous-driving capabilities and advanced driver-assistance systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Hakuhodo Technologies, a service company of Japan’s major ad agency Hakuhodo, announced it will use NVIDIA AI Blueprints and the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit to develop AI agents for autonomously producing advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimizu Corporation, a leading general contractor with over 200 years of history in Japan, revealed how it is exploring the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization to monitor work progress and potential risks at construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an NVIDIA session at AI Day Tokyo highlighted the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan, the first open synthetic dataset aligned with Japan’s real-world demographic, geographic and cultural distributions. The dataset provides a privacy-preserving, regulation-ready foundation for sovereign AI systems to reflect Japanese society without relying on sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Atsunori Fujita, senior solution architect at NVIDIA Japan, introduces the newly released Nemotron-Personas-Japan dataset." class="full-width-layout__image" height="1334" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nemotron-personas-japan.jpeg" width="1999" /&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Apple have moved to dismiss a lawsuit by Elon Musk's xAI alleging that ChatGPT's integration into a "handful" of iPhone features violated antitrust laws by giving OpenAI a monopoly on prompts and Apple a new path to block rivals in the smartphone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in August after Musk raged on X about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI argued, the estimates in xAI's complaint seemed "baseless," with Musk hesitant to even "hazard a guess" at what portion of the chatbot market is being foreclosed by the OpenAI/Apple deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI suggested that the ChatGPT integration may give OpenAI "up to 55 percent" of the potential chatbot prompts in the market, which could mean anywhere from 0 to 55 percent, OpenAI and Apple noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk's company apparently arrived at this vague estimate by doing "back-of-the-envelope math," and the court should reject his complaint, OpenAI argued. That math "was evidently calculated by assuming that Siri fields '1.5 billion user requests per day globally,' then dividing that quantity by the 'total prompts for generative AI chatbots in 2024,'"—"apparently 2.7 billion per day," OpenAI explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates "ignore the facts" that "ChatGPT integration is only available on the latest models of iPhones, which allow users to opt into the integration," OpenAI argued. And for any user that opts in, they must link their ChatGPT account for OpenAI to train on their data, OpenAI said, further restricting the potential prompt pool.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;By Musk's own logic, OpenAI alleged, "the relevant set of Siri prompts thus cannot plausibly be 1.5 billion per day, but is instead an unknown, unpleaded fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that number."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenAI mocked Musk for using 2024 statistics, writing that xAI failed to explain "the logic of using a year-old estimate of the number of prompts when the pleadings elsewhere acknowledge that the industry is experiencing 'exponential growth.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's filing agreed that Musk's calculations "stretch logic," appearing "to rest on speculative and implausible assumptions that the agreement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to all Siri requests from all Apple devices (including older models), and that OpenAI may use all such requests to train ChatGPT and achieve scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not all Siri requests" result in ChatGPT prompts that OpenAI can train on, Apple noted, "even by users who have enabled devices and opt in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI reminds court of Grok’s MechaHitler scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI argued that Musk's lawsuit is part of a pattern of harassment that OpenAI previously described as "unrelenting" since ChatGPT's successful debut, alleging it was "the latest effort by the world’s wealthiest man to stifle competition in the world’s most innovative industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI sees it, "Musk’s pretext for litigation this time is that Apple chose to offer ChatGPT as an optional add-on for several built-in applications on its latest iPhones," without giving Grok the same deal. But OpenAI noted that the integration was rolled out around the same time that Musk removed "woke filters" that caused Grok to declare itself "MechaHitler." For Apple, it was a business decision to avoid Grok, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not reference the Grok scandal in its filing, but in a footnote confirmed that "vetting of partners is particularly important given some of the concerns about generative AI chatbots, including on child safety issues, nonconsensual intimate imagery, and 'jailbreaking'—feeding input to a chatbot so it ignores its own safety guardrails."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar logic was applied to Apple's decision not to highlight Grok as a "Must Have" app, their filing said. After Musk's public rant about Grok's exclusion on X, "Apple employees explained the objective reasons why Grok was not included on certain lists, and identified app improvements," Apple noted, but instead of making changes, xAI filed the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also taking time to point out the obvious, Apple argued that Musk's seeming fixation on his charting apps never making the "Must Have Apps" list seemed to suggest that Apple's picks should always mirror "Top Charts" tracking popular downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That assumes that the Apple-curated Must-Have Apps List must be distorted if it does not strictly parrot App Store Top Charts," Apple argued. "But that assumption is illogical: there would be little point in maintaining a Must-Have Apps List if all it did was restate what Top Charts say, rather than offer Apple’s editorial recommendations to users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely most relevant to the antitrust charges, Apple accused Musk of improperly arguing that "Apple cannot partner with OpenAI to create an innovative feature for iPhone users without simultaneously partnering with every other generative AI chatbot—regardless of quality, privacy or safety considerations, technical feasibility, stage of development, or commercial terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No facts plausibly" support xAI's "assertion that Apple intentionally 'deprioritized'" xAI apps "as part of an illegal conspiracy or monopolization scheme," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most glaringly, Apple noted that xAI is not a rival or consumer in the smartphone industry, where it alleges competition is being harmed. Apple urged the court to reject Musk's theory that Apple is incentivized to boost OpenAI to prevent xAI's ascent in building a "super app" that would render smartphones obsolete. If Musk's super app dream is even possible, Apple argued, it's at least a decade off, insisting that as-yet-undeveloped apps should not serve as the basis for blocking Apple's measured plan to better serve customers with sophisticated chatbot integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Antitrust laws do not require that, and for good reason: imposing such a rule on businesses would slow innovation, reduce quality, and increase costs, all ultimately harming the very consumers the antitrust laws are meant to protect," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk’s weird smartphone market claim, explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple alleged that Musk's "grievance" can be "reduced to displeasure that Apple has not yet 'integrated with any other generative AI chatbots' beyond ChatGPT, such as those created by xAI, Google, and Anthropic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a footnote, the smartphone giant noted that by xAI's logic, Musk's social media platform X "may be required to integrate all other chatbots—including ChatGPT—on its own social media platform."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But antitrust law doesn't work that way, Apple argued, urging the court to reject xAI's claims of alleged market harms that "rely on a multi-step chain of speculation on top of speculation." As Apple summarized, xAI contends that "if Apple never integrated ChatGPT," xAI could win in both chatbot and smartphone markets, but only if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Consumers would choose to send additional prompts to Grok (rather than other generative AI chatbots).&lt;br /&gt;
2. The additional prompts would result in Grok achieving scale and quality it could not otherwise achieve.&lt;br /&gt;
3. As a result, the X app would grow in popularity because it is integrated with Grok.&lt;br /&gt;
4. X and xAI would therefore be better positioned to build so-called “super apps” in the future, which the complaint defines as "multi-functional" apps that offer "social connectivity and messaging, financial services, e-commerce, and entertainment."&lt;br /&gt;
5. Once developed, consumers might choose to use X’s "super app" for various functions.&lt;br /&gt;
6. "Super apps" would replace much of the functionality of smartphones and consumers would care less about the quality of their physical phones and rely instead on these hypothetical “super apps."&lt;br /&gt;
7. Smartphone manufacturers would respond by offering more basic models of smartphones with less functionality.&lt;br /&gt;
8. iPhone users would decide to replace their iPhones with more "basic smartphones" with "super apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple insisted that nothing in its OpenAI deal prevents Musk from building his super apps, while noting that from integrating Grok into X, Musk understands that integration of a single chatbot is a "major undertaking" that requires "substantial investment.” That "concession" alone "underscores the massive resources Apple would need to devote to integrating every AI chatbot into Apple Intelligence," while navigating potential user safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone maker also reminded the court that it has always planned to integrate other chatbots into its native features after investing in and testing Apple Intelligence's performance, relying on what Apple deems is the best chatbot on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing Apple up, OpenAI noted that Musk's complaint seemed to cherry-pick testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that "Google could not reach an agreement to integrate" Gemini "with Apple because Apple had decided to integrate ChatGPT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The full testimony recorded in open court reveals Mr. Pichai attesting to his understanding that 'Apple plans to expand to other providers for Generative AI distribution' and that '[a]s CEO of Google, [he is] hoping to execute a Gemini distribution agreement with Apple' later in 2025," OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Apple have moved to dismiss a lawsuit by Elon Musk's xAI alleging that ChatGPT's integration into a "handful" of iPhone features violated antitrust laws by giving OpenAI a monopoly on prompts and Apple a new path to block rivals in the smartphone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in August after Musk raged on X about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI argued, the estimates in xAI's complaint seemed "baseless," with Musk hesitant to even "hazard a guess" at what portion of the chatbot market is being foreclosed by the OpenAI/Apple deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI suggested that the ChatGPT integration may give OpenAI "up to 55 percent" of the potential chatbot prompts in the market, which could mean anywhere from 0 to 55 percent, OpenAI and Apple noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk's company apparently arrived at this vague estimate by doing "back-of-the-envelope math," and the court should reject his complaint, OpenAI argued. That math "was evidently calculated by assuming that Siri fields '1.5 billion user requests per day globally,' then dividing that quantity by the 'total prompts for generative AI chatbots in 2024,'"—"apparently 2.7 billion per day," OpenAI explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates "ignore the facts" that "ChatGPT integration is only available on the latest models of iPhones, which allow users to opt into the integration," OpenAI argued. And for any user that opts in, they must link their ChatGPT account for OpenAI to train on their data, OpenAI said, further restricting the potential prompt pool.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;By Musk's own logic, OpenAI alleged, "the relevant set of Siri prompts thus cannot plausibly be 1.5 billion per day, but is instead an unknown, unpleaded fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that number."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenAI mocked Musk for using 2024 statistics, writing that xAI failed to explain "the logic of using a year-old estimate of the number of prompts when the pleadings elsewhere acknowledge that the industry is experiencing 'exponential growth.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's filing agreed that Musk's calculations "stretch logic," appearing "to rest on speculative and implausible assumptions that the agreement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to all Siri requests from all Apple devices (including older models), and that OpenAI may use all such requests to train ChatGPT and achieve scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not all Siri requests" result in ChatGPT prompts that OpenAI can train on, Apple noted, "even by users who have enabled devices and opt in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI reminds court of Grok’s MechaHitler scandal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI argued that Musk's lawsuit is part of a pattern of harassment that OpenAI previously described as "unrelenting" since ChatGPT's successful debut, alleging it was "the latest effort by the world’s wealthiest man to stifle competition in the world’s most innovative industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI sees it, "Musk’s pretext for litigation this time is that Apple chose to offer ChatGPT as an optional add-on for several built-in applications on its latest iPhones," without giving Grok the same deal. But OpenAI noted that the integration was rolled out around the same time that Musk removed "woke filters" that caused Grok to declare itself "MechaHitler." For Apple, it was a business decision to avoid Grok, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not reference the Grok scandal in its filing, but in a footnote confirmed that "vetting of partners is particularly important given some of the concerns about generative AI chatbots, including on child safety issues, nonconsensual intimate imagery, and 'jailbreaking'—feeding input to a chatbot so it ignores its own safety guardrails."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar logic was applied to Apple's decision not to highlight Grok as a "Must Have" app, their filing said. After Musk's public rant about Grok's exclusion on X, "Apple employees explained the objective reasons why Grok was not included on certain lists, and identified app improvements," Apple noted, but instead of making changes, xAI filed the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also taking time to point out the obvious, Apple argued that Musk's seeming fixation on his charting apps never making the "Must Have Apps" list seemed to suggest that Apple's picks should always mirror "Top Charts" tracking popular downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That assumes that the Apple-curated Must-Have Apps List must be distorted if it does not strictly parrot App Store Top Charts," Apple argued. "But that assumption is illogical: there would be little point in maintaining a Must-Have Apps List if all it did was restate what Top Charts say, rather than offer Apple’s editorial recommendations to users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely most relevant to the antitrust charges, Apple accused Musk of improperly arguing that "Apple cannot partner with OpenAI to create an innovative feature for iPhone users without simultaneously partnering with every other generative AI chatbot—regardless of quality, privacy or safety considerations, technical feasibility, stage of development, or commercial terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No facts plausibly" support xAI's "assertion that Apple intentionally 'deprioritized'" xAI apps "as part of an illegal conspiracy or monopolization scheme," Apple argued.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone maker also reminded the court that it has always planned to integrate other chatbots into its native features after investing in and testing Apple Intelligence's performance, relying on what Apple deems is the best chatbot on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing Apple up, OpenAI noted that Musk's complaint seemed to cherry-pick testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that "Google could not reach an agreement to integrate" Gemini "with Apple because Apple had decided to integrate ChatGPT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The full testimony recorded in open court reveals Mr. Pichai attesting to his understanding that 'Apple plans to expand to other providers for Generative AI distribution' and that '[a]s CEO of Google, [he is] hoping to execute a Gemini distribution agreement with Apple' later in 2025," OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers, airing their grievances on X, seem torn over how the launch fits into OpenAI’s nonprofit mission to develop advanced AI that benefits humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI-based feeds are scary,” said OpenAI pretraining researcher John Hallman in a post on X. “I won’t deny that I felt some concern when I first learned we were releasing Sora 2. That said, I think the team did the absolute best job they possibly could in designing a positive experience&amp;nbsp;… We’re going to do our best to make sure AI helps and does not hurt humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;AI-based feeds are scary.

Compared to other platforms, I find myself scrolling way… https://t.co/uLeeVMKncl&lt;/p&gt;— John Hallman (@johnohallman) September 30, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Boaz Barak, another OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, replied: “I share a similar mix of worry and excitement. Sora 2 is technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Former OpenAI researcher Rohan Pandey used the moment to plug a new startup, Periodic Labs, which is made up of former AI lab researchers trying to build AI systems for scientific discovery: “If you don’t want to build the infinite AI TikTok slop machine but want to develop AI that accelerates fundamental science&amp;nbsp;… come join us at Periodic Labs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were many other posts along the same lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Sora launch highlights a core tension for OpenAI that flares up time and time again. It’s the fastest-growing consumer tech company on Earth, but it’s also a frontier AI lab with a lofty nonprofit charter. Some former OpenAI employees I’ve spoken to argue the consumer business can, in theory, serve the mission: ChatGPT helps fund AI research and distribute the technology widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said as much in a post on X Wednesday, addressing why the company is allocating so much capital and computing power to an AI social media app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We do mostly need the capital for build [sic] AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort,” said Altman. “It is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we launched chatgpt there was a lot of ‘who needs this and where is AGI,’” Altman continued. “[R]eality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;i get the vibe here, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some… https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) October 1, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But at what point does OpenAI’s consumer business overtake its nonprofit mission? In other words, when does OpenAI say no to a money-making, platform-growing opportunity because it’s at odds with the mission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question looms as regulators scrutinize OpenAI’s for-profit transition, which OpenAI needs to complete to raise additional capital and eventually go public. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said last month that he is “particularly concerned with ensuring that the stated safety mission of&amp;nbsp;OpenAI as a nonprofit remains front and center” in the restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Skeptics have dismissed OpenAI’s mission as a branding tool to lure talent from Big Tech. But many insiders at OpenAI insist it’s central to why they joined the company in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, Sora’s footprint is small; the app is one day old. But its debut marks a significant expansion of OpenAI’s consumer business and exposes the company to incentives that have plagued social media apps for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike ChatGPT, which is optimized for usefulness, OpenAI says Sora is built for fun — a place to generate and share AI clips. The feed feels closer to TikTok or Instagram Reels, platforms that are infamous for their addictive loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI insists it wants to avoid those pitfalls, claiming in a blog post announcing the Sora launch that “concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind.” The company explicitly says it’s not optimizing for time spent on feed and instead wants to maximize creation. OpenAI says it will send reminders to users when they’ve been scrolling for too long, and primarily show them people they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s a stronger starting point than Meta’s Vibes — another AI-powered short-form video feed released last week — which seems to have been raced out without as many safeguards. As a former OpenAI policy leader, Miles Brundage points out that it’s possible there will be good and bad applications of AI-video feeds, much like we’ve seen in the chatbot era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, as Altman has long acknowledged, no one sets out to build an addictive app. The incentives of running a feed guide them to it. OpenAI has even run into problems around sycophancy in ChatGPT, which the company says was unintentional due to some of its training techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a June podcast, Altman discussed what he calls “the big misalignment of social media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the big mistakes of the social media era was [that] the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended, negative consequences on society as a whole, and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted — or someone thought users wanted — in the moment, which is [to] get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s too soon to tell how aligned the Sora app is with its users or OpenAI’s mission. Users are already noticing some engagement-optimizing techniques in the app, such as the dynamic emojis that appear every time you like a video. That feels designed to shoot a little dopamine to users for engaging with a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The real test will be how OpenAI evolves Sora. Given how much AI has taken over regular social media feeds, it seems plausible that AI-native feeds could soon have their moment. Whether OpenAI can grow Sora without replicating the mistakes of its predecessors remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2170386424.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Several current and former OpenAI researchers are speaking out over the company’s first foray into social media: the Sora app, a TikTok-style feed filled with AI-generated videos and a lot of Sam Altman deepfakes.
