&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abbott felt that many manual tasks in logistics could be automated using AI. That’s why last year he launched Augment, which offers an AI assistant called “Augie” that can take over tedious and repetitive work performed by freight shippers, carriers, and brokers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Augment announced that it raised an $85 million Series A led by Redpoint, with participation from 8VC, Autotech Ventures, and others. The massive round comes just five months after the startup launched out of stealth with a hefty $25 million seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Freight and logistics is a very large industry that employs lots of people who are busy chasing emails, documents, phone calls, text messages all day long,” Abbott told TechCrunch. “Augie can take care of all that like their own personal assistant, so they can focus on relationships and negotiations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Augie can perform seven key tasks in the logistics process, from gathering and reviewing pricing bids from trucking companies and tracking packages en route, to building a load — the method of combining multiple shipments to maximize truck space — and collecting invoicing documents to ensure timely billing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All of these processes typically involve numerous phone calls, emails, or texts exchanged between various participants in the logistics process. Augie can help humans streamline those communications by operating across multiple channels like voice, email, Slack, SMS, and Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Augment is not disclosing its revenue, Abbott says the company has more than doubled the number of customers it serves since raising its seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although many customers are still trialing the product, fully onboarded clients like Armstrong Transport Group are already achieving significant productivity gains with Augment, such as a 40% reduction in invoice delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacob Effron, a managing director at Redpoint, said he invested in Augment after speaking with a number of Augment’s clients. “The customer feedback is honestly amazing. People really love the product. I think they use it in quite a ubiquitous way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The large funding round will go toward hiring 50 engineers and then working on adding more features. “It is a large, fragmented market. It’s complex, it’s messy. The systems are a bit archaic and siloed,” Abbott said. “We have to have many engineers because there’s lots of software systems these companies use.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is currently serving the trucking industry, but its long-term vision is to expand into international shipping and other aspects of logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Abbott is not alone in pursuing AI for logistics. Other AI assistants for freight management include Vooma and FleetWorks.&amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, shipping giants FedEx and UPS have signaled that they are investing in proprietary AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But all the competition doesn’t phase Abbott. “We have tremendous adoption,” he said. “Augie does really cool stuff. Augie is really thinking ahead and reasoning like a human and acting on it, so it saves everybody a lot of time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Harish-Abbott-2.png?resize=1200,670" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Having built and sold e-commerce shipping startup Deliverr to Shopify for $2.1 billion in 2022, co-founder and CEO Harish Abbott knows the logistics industry well.&lt;/p&gt;

The product is called the OpenAI Jobs Platform, and the company expects to launch the service by mid-2026, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo announced the new endeavor in a blog post Thursday, saying the company will “use AI to help find the perfect matches between what companies need and what workers can offer.” Simo said the service would offer a dedicated track for small businesses and local governments to access top AI talent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is interested in expanding into several new markets beyond its core consumer offering, ChatGPT. At a recent dinner with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Simo would oversee several applications beyond the chatbot. This will apparently include the OpenAI Jobs Platform and potentially other offerings OpenAI is reportedly working on, such as a browser and a social media app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, OpenAI’s hiring platform could put the company in direct competition with LinkedIn, which was co-founded by Reid Hoffman, one of OpenAI’s earliest investors. LinkedIn is also owned by Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest financial backer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, LinkedIn has worked to infuse its platform with AI features to help match job candidates with businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also says it will start offering certifications for people with different levels of “AI fluency” through its OpenAI Academy, an online program the company launched last year. An OpenAI spokesperson says the company plans to launch a pilot of OpenAI Certifications in late 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many tech executives have raised concerns that AI will disrupt numerous traditional jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs before 2030. In her blog post, Simo acknowledged that risk, saying OpenAI can’t prevent that disruption. However, she says the company can do its part by helping people become fluent in AI and connecting them with companies that need their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT maker says it’s working with Walmart, one of the biggest private employers in the world, on its certification program and aims to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says it’s launching these programs as part of its commitment to the White House’s initiative to expand AI literacy.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch is an example of how the fashion industry is leveraging AI technology to enhance customer experiences and is one of the first partnerships to see three retailers come together to offer a personalized AI experience. Revolve and FWRD let users shop designer clothing, while Revolve also has an option to shop pre-owned. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool, Ella, provides recommendations to customers across the three retailers on what to purchase or rent to make an outfit come to life.&amp;nbsp;For example, users can ask for “a bachelorette weekend outfit,” or “what to pack for a trip,” and the technology will search across the Vivrelle, FWRD, and Revolve shopping platforms to create outfit suggestions. Users can then check out in one cart on Vivrelle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In theory, the more one uses Ella, the better its suggestions become. It’s the fashion equivalent of asking ChatGPT what to wear in Miami for a girl’s weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042438" height="525" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ELLA-AI-.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Vivrelle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blake Geffen, the CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle (which announced a $62 million Series C earlier this year), told TechCrunch that she hopes Ella can take the “stress out of packing for a vacation or everyday dressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ella has been in the works for quite some time,” she told TechCrunch, adding that it took about a year to build and release the product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is actually the second AI tool from the three companies. The Vivrelle, Revolve, and FWRD partnership  earlier this year also launched Complete the Look, which offers last-minute fashion suggestions to complement what’s in a customer’s cart at checkout. Their latest tool, Ella, however, takes the fashion recommendation game to another level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fashion has been obsessed with trying to make personalized shopping happen for decades now. Even the 90s movie “Clueless” showed Cher picking outfits from her digitized wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This current AI boom has led to rapid innovation and democratized access to AI technology, allowing many fashion companies to launch personalized AI fashion platforms and raise millions while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With Ella, we’re giving our members as much flexibility and options as possible to shop or borrow with ease, through seamless conversations that allow you to share as little or as much as you want, just like talking to a live stylist,” Geffen said. “We’re excited to be the first brand to integrate rental, resale, and retail into one streamlined omnichannel experience.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The luxury membership platform Vivrelle, which allows customers to rent high-end goods, announced Thursday the launch of an AI personal styling tool called Ella as part of its partnership with fashion retailers Revolve and FWRD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment comes after recent NVIDIA announcements to support AI education and academic research, including a $30 million contribution to the National AI Intelligence Research pilot and a U.S. National Science Foundation partnership in support of academic research. Over the last five years, NVIDIA has invested $50 million in higher education and academic research in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pledging $25 million in support with AI education programs, NVIDIA is partnering with Study Fetch and CK-12 — two leading K-12 learning platforms — to tailor the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) and NVIDIA Academy content offerings to meet the instructional needs of U.S. K-12 classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA effort aligns with the White House executive order Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American Youth, announced in April.

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-8a16a100-7fff-866e-17d3-0c98f0ab7768"&gt;3D printing has come a long way since its invention in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who pioneered stereolithography, a technique that solidifies liquid resin into solid objects using ultraviolet lasers. Over the decades, 3D printers have evolved from experimental curiosities into tools capable of producing everything from custom prosthetics to complex food designs, architectural models, and even functioning human organs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But as the technology matures, its environmental footprint has become increasingly difficult to set aside. The vast majority of consumer and industrial 3D printing still relies on petroleum-based plastic filament. And while “greener” alternatives made from biodegradable or recycled materials exist, they come with a serious trade-off: they’re often not as strong. These eco-friendly filaments tend to become brittle under stress, making them ill-suited for structural applications or load-bearing parts — exactly where strength matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This trade-off between sustainability and mechanical performance prompted researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Hasso Plattner Institute to ask: Is it possible to build objects that are mostly eco-friendly, but still strong where it counts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Their answer is SustainaPrint, a new software and hardware toolkit designed to help users strategically combine strong and weak filaments to get the best of both worlds. Instead of printing an entire object with high-performance plastic, the system analyzes a model through finite element analysis simulations, predicts where the object is most likely to experience stress, and then reinforces just those zones with stronger material. The rest of the part can be printed using greener, weaker filament, reducing plastic use while preserving structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Our hope is that SustainaPrint can be used in industrial and distributed manufacturing settings one day, where local material stocks may vary in quality and composition,” says MIT PhD student and CSAIL researcher Maxine Perroni-Scharf, who is a lead author on a paper presenting the project. “In these contexts, the testing toolkit could help ensure the reliability of available filaments, while the software’s reinforcement strategy could reduce overall material consumption without sacrificing function.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For their experiments, the team used Polymaker’s PolyTerra PLA as the eco-friendly filament, and standard or Tough PLA from Ultimaker for reinforcement. They used a 20 percent reinforcement threshold to show that even a small amount of strong plastic goes a long way. Using this ratio, SustainaPrint was able to recover up to 70 percent of the strength of an object printed entirely with high-performance plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;They printed dozens of objects, from simple mechanical shapes like rings and beams to more functional household items such as headphone stands, wall hooks, and plant pots. Each object was printed three ways: once using only eco-friendly filament, once using only strong PLA, and once with the hybrid SustainaPrint configuration. The printed parts were then mechanically tested by pulling, bending, or otherwise breaking them to measure how much force each configuration could withstand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In many cases, the hybrid prints held up nearly as well as the full-strength versions. For example, in one test involving a dome-like shape, the hybrid version outperformed the version printed entirely in Tough PLA. The team believes this may be due to the reinforced version’s ability to distribute stress more evenly, avoiding the brittle failure sometimes caused by excessive stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This indicates that in certain geometries and loading conditions, mixing materials strategically may actually outperform a single homogenous material,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It’s a reminder that real-world mechanical behavior is full of complexity, especially in 3D printing, where interlayer adhesion and tool path decisions can affect performance in unexpected ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lean, green, eco-friendly printing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;SustainaPrint starts off by letting a user upload their 3D model into a custom interface. By selecting fixed regions and areas where forces will be applied, the software then uses an approach called “Finite Element Analysis” to simulate how the object will deform under stress. It then creates a map showing pressure distribution inside the structure, highlighting areas under compression or tension, and applies heuristics to segment the object into two categories: those that need reinforcement, and those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recognizing the need for accessible and low-cost testing, the team also developed a DIY testing toolkit to help users assess strength before printing. The kit has a 3D-printable device with modules for measuring both tensile and flexural strength. Users can pair the device with common items like pull-up bars or digital scales to get rough, but reliable performance metrics. The team benchmarked their results against manufacturer data and found that their measurements consistently fell within one standard deviation, even for filaments that had undergone multiple recycling cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although the current system is designed for dual-extrusion printers, the researchers believe that with some manual filament swapping and calibration, it could be adapted for single-extruder setups, too. In current form, the system simplifies the modeling process by allowing just one force and one fixed boundary per simulation. While this covers a wide range of common use cases, the team sees future work expanding the software to support more complex and dynamic loading conditions. The team also sees potential in using AI to infer the object’s intended use based on its geometry, which could allow for fully automated stress modeling without manual input of forces or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers plan to release SustainaPrint open-source, making both the software and testing toolkit available for public use and modification. Another initiative they aspire to bring to life in the future: education. “In a classroom, SustainaPrint isn’t just a tool, it’s a way to teach students about material science, structural engineering, and sustainable design, all in one project,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It turns these abstract concepts into something tangible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As 3D printing becomes more embedded in how we manufacture and prototype everything from consumer goods to emergency equipment, sustainability concerns will only grow. With tools like SustainaPrint, those concerns no longer need to come at the expense of performance. Instead, they can become part of the design process: built into the very geometry of the things we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Co-author Patrick Baudisch, who is a professor at the Hasso Plattner Institute, adds that “the project addresses a key question: What is the point of collecting material for the purpose of recycling, when there is no plan to actually ever use that material? Maxine presents the missing link between the theoretical/abstract idea of 3D printing material recycling and what it actually takes to make this idea relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Perroni-Scharf and Baudisch wrote the paper with CSAIL research assistant Jennifer Xiao; MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science master’s student Cole Paulin ’24; master’s student Ray Wang SM ’25 and PhD student Ticha Sethapakdi SM ’19 (both CSAIL members); Hasso Plattner Institute PhD student Muhammad Abdullah; and Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, lead of the Human-Computer Interaction Engineering Group at CSAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers’ work was supported by a Designing for Sustainability Grant from the Designing for Sustainability MIT-HPI Research Program. Their work will be presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sierra, which helps enterprises build customer service AI agents, announced it raised a $350 million funding round on Thursday. The round, led by earlier investor Greenoaks Capital, values the startup at $10 billion, according to a company blog post that confirmed an earlier report from Axios on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sierra was founded in early 2024 by Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor. The company claims to have landed hundreds of customers, including SoFi, Ramp, and Brex, among others, in its 18 months of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sierra has now raised $635 million altogether, including $110 million that closed in February of last year led by Sequoia and Benchmark, and a $175 million round that closed in October of last year led by Greenoaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Others of its investors include ICONIQ and Thrive Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As TechCrunch has previously reported, Taylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other consumer-facing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook’s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he’d oversee the Twitter board throughout Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, in fact, Taylor announced that Sierra is launching its second year of its so-called APX program, a rotational opportunity for recent technical graduates that directly mirrors the Google program that launched both Taylor’s and co-founder Clay Bavor’s careers two decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hiring announcement stands out in what has become an increasingly tough job market, particularly as companies assess the power of AI technologies like those Sierra is selling and their potential impact on workforce needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The program targets computer science graduates and says it offers experience in both agent engineering and product management. Taylor described the roles as providing what he calls “an irresponsible amount of responsibility” — similar to the freedom to build and launch products that he and Bavor had at Google — with new graduates expected to work on multiple product launches during their first year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AP22166762816752.jpg?w=1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Investors are clearly bullish about former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor’s AI agent startup Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;
