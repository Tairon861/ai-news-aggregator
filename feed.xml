(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/a-new-test-for-ai-labs-are-you-even-trying-to-make-money/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ilyausutskever-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;We’re&amp;nbsp;in a unique moment for AI companies building their own foundation model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, there is a whole generation of industry veterans who made their name at major tech companies and are now going solo. You also have legendary researchers with immense experience but ambiguous commercial aspirations.&amp;nbsp;There’s&amp;nbsp;a clear chance that at least some of these new labs will become OpenAI-sized behemoths, but there’s also room for them to putter around doing interesting research&amp;nbsp;without worrying too much about commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The end result?&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;getting hard to tell who is&amp;nbsp;actually trying&amp;nbsp;to make money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To&amp;nbsp;make things simpler,&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;proposing a kind of sliding scale for any company making a foundation model.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;a five-level scale where it&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;matter if&amp;nbsp;you’re&amp;nbsp;actually making&amp;nbsp;money – only if&amp;nbsp;you’re&amp;nbsp;trying to.&amp;nbsp;The idea here is to measure ambition, not&amp;nbsp;success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Think of&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;in these terms:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5&lt;/strong&gt;: We are already making millions of dollars every day, thank you very much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;We have a detailed multi-stage plan to become the richest human beings on Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;We have many promising product ideas, which will be revealed in&amp;nbsp;the fullness of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;We have the outlines of a concept of a plan&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;True wealth is when you love yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The big names are all at Level 5: OpenAI, Anthropic,&amp;nbsp;Gemini, and so on. The scale gets more interesting with the new generation of labs launching now, with big dreams but ambitions that can be harder to read.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Crucially, the people involved in these labs can&amp;nbsp;generally choose&amp;nbsp;whatever level they want.&amp;nbsp;There’s&amp;nbsp;so much money in AI right now that no one is going to interrogate them for a business plan. Even if the lab is just a research project, investors will count themselves happy to be involved. If you&amp;nbsp;aren’t&amp;nbsp;particularly motivated to become a billionaire, you might well live a happier life at Level 2 than&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Level 5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 13-15, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problems arise because it&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;always clear where an AI lab lands on the scale — and a lot of the AI industry’s current drama comes from that confusion.&amp;nbsp;Much&amp;nbsp;of the anxiety over OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit came because the lab spent years at Level 1, then jumped to Level 5&amp;nbsp;almost overnight. On the other&amp;nbsp;side, you might argue that Meta’s early AI research was firmly at Level 2, when what the company really wanted was Level 4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With that in mind,&amp;nbsp;here’s&amp;nbsp;a quick rundown of four of the biggest contemporary AI labs, and how they&amp;nbsp;measure up&amp;nbsp;on the scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humans-amp-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans&amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Humans&amp;amp; was the big AI news this week, and part of the inspiration for&amp;nbsp;coming up with&amp;nbsp;this whole scale. The founders have a compelling pitch for the next generation of AI models, with scaling laws giving way to an emphasis on communication and coordination tools.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But for all the glowing press, Humans&amp;amp; has been coy about how that would translate into actual monetizable products.&amp;nbsp;It seems&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;want to build products; the&amp;nbsp;team&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;won’t&amp;nbsp;commit to anything specific.&amp;nbsp;The most&amp;nbsp;they’ve&amp;nbsp;said is&amp;nbsp;that they will be building some kind of AI workplace tool, replacing products like Slack, Jira and Google Docs but also redefining how these other tools&amp;nbsp;work at a fundamental level. Workplace software for a post-software workplace!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s&amp;nbsp;my job to know what this stuff&amp;nbsp;means,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;pretty confused&amp;nbsp;about that last part.&amp;nbsp;But it is just specific enough that I think we can put them at Level 3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thinking-machines-lab-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking Machines Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is a very hard one to rate!&amp;nbsp;Generally, if&amp;nbsp;you have a former CTO and project lead for ChatGPT raising a&amp;nbsp;$2 billion&amp;nbsp;seed round, you&amp;nbsp;have to&amp;nbsp;assume there is a pretty specific roadmap. Mira Murati does not strike me as someone who jumps in without a plan, so coming into 2026, I would have felt good putting TML at Level 4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But then&amp;nbsp;the last two weeks happened. The departure of CTO and co-founder Barret&amp;nbsp;Zoph&amp;nbsp;has gotten most of the headlines, due in part to&amp;nbsp;the special circumstances&amp;nbsp;involved. But at least five other employees left with&amp;nbsp;Zoph, many citing concerns about the direction of the company. Just one year in,&amp;nbsp;nearly half&amp;nbsp;the executives on TML’s founding team are no longer working there. One way to read events is that they thought they had a solid plan to become a world-class AI lab, only to find the plan&amp;nbsp;wasn’t&amp;nbsp;as solid as they thought. Or in terms of the scale, they wanted a Level 4 lab but realized they were at Level 2 or 3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There still&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;quite enough evidence to justify a downgrade, but&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;getting close.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-world-labs-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Labs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fei-Fei Li is one of the most respected names in AI research, best known for&amp;nbsp;establishing&amp;nbsp;the ImageNet challenge that kickstarted contemporary deep learning techniques. She currently holds a Sequoia-endowed chair at Stanford, where she co-directs two different AI labs.&amp;nbsp;I won’t bore you by going through all the different honors and academy positions, but it’s enough to say that if she wanted, she could spend the rest of her life just receiving awards and being told how great she is.&amp;nbsp;Her book&amp;nbsp;is pretty good too!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So&amp;nbsp;in 2024, when Li announced she had raised $230 million for a spatial AI company called World Labs, you might think we were&amp;nbsp;operating&amp;nbsp;at Level 2 or lower.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that was over a year ago, which&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;a long time&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the AI world. Since then, World Labs has shipped both&amp;nbsp;a full world-generating model&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;a commercialized product&amp;nbsp;built on top of it. Over the same period,&amp;nbsp;we’ve&amp;nbsp;seen real signs of demand for world-modeling from both video game and special effects industries — and none of the major labs have built anything that can compete. The result looks an awful lot like a Level 4 company,&amp;nbsp;perhaps soon&amp;nbsp;to graduate to Level 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safe-superintelligence-ssi-nbsp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe Superintelligence (SSI)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya&amp;nbsp;Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence (or SSI) seems like a classic example of a Level 1 startup.&amp;nbsp;Sutskever&amp;nbsp;has gone to great lengths to keep SSI insulated&amp;nbsp;from commercial pressures,&amp;nbsp;to the point of&amp;nbsp;turning down an attempted acquisition from Meta. There are no product cycles and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;seem to be any product at all. With this pitch, he raised&amp;nbsp;$3 billion!&amp;nbsp;Sutskever&amp;nbsp;has always been more interested in the science of AI than the business, and every&amp;nbsp;indication&amp;nbsp;is that this is a genuinely scientific project at heart.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, the AI world moves fast — and it would be foolish to count SSI out of the commercial realm entirely. On&amp;nbsp;his recent Dwarkesh appearance,&amp;nbsp;Sutskever&amp;nbsp;gave two reasons why SSI might pivot, either “if timelines turned out to be long, which they might” or because “there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world.” In other words, if the research either goes very well or very badly, we might see SSI jump up a few levels in a hurry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ilyausutskever-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;We’re&amp;nbsp;in a unique moment for AI companies building their own foundation model. &lt;/p&gt;

A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084423" height="486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Home-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sparkli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was first published on January 22, 2026.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Big Tech companies and upcoming startups want to use generative AI to build software and hardware for kids. A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084423" height="486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Home-Screen.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sparkli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
