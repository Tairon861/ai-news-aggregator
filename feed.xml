The subscription tier is now available in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, East Timor, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In select countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Pakistan, the company is allowing users to pay in local currencies. In the remaining countries, users must pay in USD at a price of approximately $5, with the final cost varying based on local taxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3055794" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Go-Philippines.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT Go gives users higher daily limits for messages, image generation, and file or image uploads per day. The plan also offers twice as much memory as the free plan, enabling more personalized responses.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to OpenAI, the expansion comes as the company has seen its weekly active user base in Southeast Asia grow by up to four times.  The plan was first launched in India in August, followed by Indonesia in September. OpenAI reports that paid subscribers in India have doubled since the launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is competing with Google to make affordable AI chatbot subscription plans available in more regions. Google launched its similarly priced Google AI Plus plan in Indonesia in September, followed by expansion to over 40 countries. The Plus tier gives users access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most advanced AI model, along with creative tools for image and video creation — including Flow (for design), Whisk (for image remixing), and Veo 3 Fast (for video creation) — as well as 200GB of cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The expansion comes at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. At its DevDay 2025 conference this week in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users globally, up from 700 million in August. The company also unveiled a major platform shift, introducing apps that work directly inside ChatGPT and that transform the chatbot into an ecosystem that’s similar to an app store, with partners like Spotify, Zillow, and Coursera, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The evolution we’re trying to make over the next few years is one where ChatGPT itself is more like an operating system where you can come and use applications,” the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, told TechCrunch of the development on the sidelines of the event. “If you want to write, there’s an app for that. If you want to code, there’s an app for that. If you want to interact with goods and services, there are applications for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite OpenAI’s rapid growth and recent $500 billion valuation, the company reported a $7.8 billion operating loss in the first half of 2025 as it continues spending heavily on AI infrastructure. The company’s affordable subscription tiers, like ChatGPT Go, are seen as an important step toward achieving profitability while expanding its global user base, particularly in high-growth markets across Asia where both OpenAI and Google are aggressively competing for market share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is rapidly expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, which costs under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia.

However, organisations anticipate a 32 percent increase in AI investment by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey finds that AI and security are the joint top IT priorities for UK organisations over the next 18 months, with 62 percent of respondents citing them as necessary. These are followed by hybrid or multi-cloud strategies and virtualisation, showing a clear direction in the technological focus of British businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the path to AI integration isn’t straightforward. The vast majority of organisations are facing barriers to adoption, with the high costs of implementation and maintenance being the biggest concern for 34 percent of respondents. Data privacy and security issues are a close second, troubling 30 percent, while 28 percent are struggling with the integration of AI into their existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly interesting finding is the prevalence of “shadow AI,” with 83 percent of organisations reporting the unauthorised use of AI tools by employees. This suggests a disconnect between official IT strategy and the day-to-day practices of the workforce, potentially introducing security risks and inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to navigate these challenges, UK organisations are increasingly turning to open source software. The survey reveals that 84 percent of respondents consider enterprise open source important for their AI strategy, with similarly high figures for virtualisation, hybrid and multi-cloud, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joanna Hodgson, UK Country Manager at Red Hat, said: “This year’s UK survey results show the gap between ambition and reality. Organisations are investing substantially in AI but currently only a few are delivering customer value. In the journey from experimentation to sustainable production, enterprise knowledge and integration with enterprise systems must pave the road to achieving value from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Openness is a force for greater collaboration, sharing best practice and enabling flexibility. As is the case with successful hybrid cloud investments, open-source will continue to be the bedrock for making AI more consumable and reusable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also explored the specific areas of AI that are being prioritised. Agentic AI, which involves systems that can operate with a high degree of autonomy, is the top priority for 68 percent of respondents. This is followed by the desire to enable broad employee adoption and to operationalise AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skills gap remains a persistent challenge, with AI being the most urgent area of concern for the second consecutive year. Within the field of AI, the talent shortage is most acute in agentic AI, the ability to efficiently use AI capabilities, and educating the wider business on how to use AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these domestic challenges, there is a strong sense of optimism about the UK’s position on the global AI stage. 83 percent of respondents believe the UK is either already a global AI powerhouse or has the potential to become one within the next three years. However, this confidence is tempered by a lack of talent pipeline, limited public funding, and insufficient private sector engagement, which are seen as the main factors holding the UK back from extracting value from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also touches on the complexities of cloud adoption, which is further complicated by the integration of AI workloads. Internal silos, sovereignty concerns, and unclear return on investment continue to be barriers. In response, UK organisations are prioritising operational control and autonomy, securing the software supply chain, and maintaining flexibility in their choice of IT suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hans Roth, SVP and GM for EMEA at Red Hat, commented: “Organisations want greater operational control and IT resiliency to adapt in a world of constant disruption. The survey results, as well as our daily conversations, show sovereignty prominently on the agenda for enterprise’s ongoing cloud strategies and the budding AI opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Open-source is central to this shift as it provides businesses with the transparency and flexibility to innovate rapidly without compromise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from Red Hat’s latest survey show the UK is ready to tap the value potential of AI, but is also struggling with the practicalities of implementation, skills shortages, and the complexities of the technological environment. The strong emphasis on open-source suggests a pragmatic approach, supporting collaboration and flexibility in the pursuit of AI-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung’s tiny AI model beats giant reasoning LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/cisco-ai-data-centre-router-infrastructure-bottleneck/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Cisco has entered an increasingly competitive race to dominate AI data centre interconnect technology, becoming the latest major player to unveil purpose-built routing hardware for connecting distributed AI workloads across multiple facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The networking giant unveiled its 8223 routing system on October 8, introducing what it claims is the industry’s first 51.2&amp;nbsp;terabit per second&amp;nbsp;fixed router specifically designed to link data centres running AI workloads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core sits the new Silicon One P200 chip, representing Cisco’s answer to a challenge that’s increasingly constraining the AI industry: what happens when you run out of room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-three-way-battle-for-scale-across-supremacy"&gt;A three-way battle for scale-across supremacy?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, Cisco isn’t alone in recognising this opportunity. Broadcom fired the first salvo in mid-August with its “Jericho 4” StrataDNX switch/router chips, which began sampling and also offered 51.2 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth backed by HBM memory for deep packet buffering to manage congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after Broadcom’s announcement, Nvidia unveiled its Spectrum-XGS scale-across network—a notably cheeky name given that Broadcom’s “Trident” and “Tomahawk” switch ASICs belong to the StrataXGS family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia secured CoreWeave as its anchor customer but provided limited technical details about the Spectrum-XGS ASICs. Now Cisco is rolling out its own components for the scale-across networking market, setting up a three-way competition among networking heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-problem-ai-is-too-big-for-one-building"&gt;The problem: AI is too big for one building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why multiple vendors are rushing into this space, consider the scale of modern AI infrastructure. Training large language models or running complex AI systems requires thousands of high-powered processors working in concert, generating enormous amounts of heat and consuming massive amounts of electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data centres are hitting hard limits—not just on available space, but on&amp;nbsp;how much&amp;nbsp;power they can supply and cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data centre, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centres hundreds of miles apart,” said Martin Lund, Executive Vice President of Cisco’s Common Hardware Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has traditionally addressed capacity challenges through two approaches: scaling up (adding more capability to individual systems) or scaling out (connecting more systems within the same facility).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both strategies are reaching their limits. Data centres are running out of physical space, power grids can’t supply enough electricity, and cooling systems can’t dissipate the heat fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;forces a third approach: “scale-across,” distributing AI workloads across multiple data centres that might be in different cities or even&amp;nbsp;different&amp;nbsp;states. However, this creates a new problem—the connections between these facilities become critical bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-traditional-routers-fall-short"&gt;Why traditional routers fall short&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI workloads behave differently from typical data centre traffic. Training runs generate massive, bursty traffic patterns—periods of intense data movement followed by relative quiet. If the network connecting data centres can’t absorb these surges, everything slows down, wasting expensive computing resources and, critically, time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional routing equipment&amp;nbsp;wasn’t designed&amp;nbsp;for this. Most routers prioritise either raw speed or sophisticated traffic management, but struggle to deliver both simultaneously while maintaining reasonable power consumption. For AI data centre interconnect applications, organisations need all three: speed, intelligent buffering, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cisco-s-answer-the-8223-system"&gt;Cisco’s answer: The 8223 system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco’s 8223 system represents a departure from general-purpose routing equipment. Housed in a compact three-rack-unit chassis, it delivers 64 ports of 800-gigabit connectivity—currently the highest density available in a fixed routing system. More importantly, it can process over 20 billion packets per second and scale up to three Exabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s distinguishing feature is deep buffering capability, enabled by the P200 chip. Think of buffers as temporary holding areas for data—like a reservoir that catches water during heavy rain.&amp;nbsp;When AI training generates traffic surges, the 8223’s buffers absorb the spike, preventing network congestion that would otherwise slow down expensive GPU clusters&amp;nbsp;sitting&amp;nbsp;idle waiting for data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power efficiency is another critical advantage. As a 3RU system, the 8223 achieves what Cisco describes as “switch-like power efficiency” while maintaining routing capabilities—crucial when data centres are already straining power budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also supports 800G coherent optics, enabling connections spanning up to 1,000 kilometres between facilities—essential for geographic distribution of AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industry-adoption-and-real-world-applications"&gt;Industry adoption and real-world applications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major hyperscalers are already deploying the technology.&amp;nbsp;Microsoft, an early Silicon One&amp;nbsp;adopter, has found the architecture valuable across multiple use cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Maltz,&amp;nbsp;technical fellow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;corporate vice president&amp;nbsp;of Azure Networking at Microsoft, noted that “the common ASIC architecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Cloud plans to use the P200 as a foundation for expanding its eCore architecture. Dennis Cai, vice president and head of network Infrastructure at Alibaba Cloud, stated the chip “will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumen is also exploring how the technology fits into its network infrastructure plans. Dave Ward, chief technology officer and product officer at Lumen, said the company is “exploring how the new Cisco 8223 technology may fit into our plans to enhance network performance and roll out superior services to our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-programmability-future-proofing-the-investment"&gt;Programmability: Future-proofing the investment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One often-overlooked aspect of AI data centre interconnect infrastructure is adaptability. AI networking requirements are evolving rapidly, with new protocols and standards emerging regularly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional hardware typically requires replacement or expensive upgrades to support new capabilities.

Broadcom fired the first salvo in mid-August with its “Jericho 4” StrataDNX switch/router chips, which began sampling and also offered 51.2 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth backed by HBM memory for deep packet buffering to manage congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after Broadcom’s announcement, Nvidia unveiled its Spectrum-XGS scale-across network—a notably cheeky name given that Broadcom’s “Trident” and “Tomahawk” switch ASICs belong to the StrataXGS family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia secured CoreWeave as its anchor customer but provided limited technical details about the Spectrum-XGS ASICs. Now Cisco is rolling out its own components for the scale-across networking market, setting up a three-way competition among networking heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-problem-ai-is-too-big-for-one-building"&gt;The problem: AI is too big for one building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why multiple vendors are rushing into this space, consider the scale of modern AI infrastructure. Training large language models or running complex AI systems requires thousands of high-powered processors working in concert, generating enormous amounts of heat and consuming massive amounts of electricity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data centres are hitting hard limits—not just on available space, but on&amp;nbsp;how much&amp;nbsp;power they can supply and cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data centre, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centres hundreds of miles apart,” said Martin Lund, Executive Vice President of Cisco’s Common Hardware Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has traditionally addressed capacity challenges through two approaches: scaling up (adding more capability to individual systems) or scaling out (connecting more systems within the same facility).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both strategies are reaching their limits. Data centres are running out of physical space, power grids can’t supply enough electricity, and cooling systems can’t dissipate the heat fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;forces a third approach: “scale-across,” distributing AI workloads across multiple data centres that might be in different cities or even&amp;nbsp;different&amp;nbsp;states. However, this creates a new problem—the connections between these facilities become critical bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-traditional-routers-fall-short"&gt;Why traditional routers fall short&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI workloads behave differently from typical data centre traffic. Training runs generate massive, bursty traffic patterns—periods of intense data movement followed by relative quiet. If the network connecting data centres can’t absorb these surges, everything slows down, wasting expensive computing resources and, critically, time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional routing equipment&amp;nbsp;wasn’t designed&amp;nbsp;for this. Most routers prioritise either raw speed or sophisticated traffic management, but struggle to deliver both simultaneously while maintaining reasonable power consumption. For AI data centre interconnect applications, organisations need all three: speed, intelligent buffering, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cisco-s-answer-the-8223-system"&gt;Cisco’s answer: The 8223 system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco’s 8223 system represents a departure from general-purpose routing equipment. Housed in a compact three-rack-unit chassis, it delivers 64 ports of 800-gigabit connectivity—currently the highest density available in a fixed routing system. More importantly, it can process over 20 billion packets per second and scale up to three Exabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s distinguishing feature is deep buffering capability, enabled by the P200 chip. Think of buffers as temporary holding areas for data—like a reservoir that catches water during heavy rain.&amp;nbsp;When AI training generates traffic surges, the 8223’s buffers absorb the spike, preventing network congestion that would otherwise slow down expensive GPU clusters&amp;nbsp;sitting&amp;nbsp;idle waiting for data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power efficiency is another critical advantage. As a 3RU system, the 8223 achieves what Cisco describes as “switch-like power efficiency” while maintaining routing capabilities—crucial when data centres are already straining power budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also supports 800G coherent optics, enabling connections spanning up to 1,000 kilometres between facilities—essential for geographic distribution of AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industry-adoption-and-real-world-applications"&gt;Industry adoption and real-world applications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major hyperscalers are already deploying the technology.&amp;nbsp;Microsoft, an early Silicon One&amp;nbsp;adopter, has found the architecture valuable across multiple use cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Maltz,&amp;nbsp;technical fellow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;corporate vice president&amp;nbsp;of Azure Networking at Microsoft, noted that “the common ASIC architecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Cloud plans to use the P200 as a foundation for expanding its eCore architecture. Dennis Cai, vice president and head of network Infrastructure at Alibaba Cloud, stated the chip “will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumen is also exploring how the technology fits into its network infrastructure plans. Dave Ward, chief technology officer and product officer at Lumen, said the company is “exploring how the new Cisco 8223 technology may fit into our plans to enhance network performance and roll out superior services to our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-programmability-future-proofing-the-investment"&gt;Programmability: Future-proofing the investment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One often-overlooked aspect of AI data centre interconnect infrastructure is adaptability. AI networking requirements are evolving rapidly, with new protocols and standards emerging regularly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional hardware typically requires replacement or expensive upgrades to support new capabilities. The P200’s programmability addresses this challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations can update the silicon to support emerging protocols without replacing hardware—important when individual routing systems represent significant capital investments and AI networking standards remain in flux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-considerations"&gt;Security considerations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting data centres hundreds of miles apart introduces security challenges.

My immunome knows the score. (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/09/1125376/how-healthy-am-i-my-immunome-knows-the-score/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story is a collaboration between MIT Technology Review and Aventine, a non-profit research foundation that creates and supports content about how technology and science are changing the way we live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not often you get a text about the robustness of your immune system, but that’s what popped up on my phone last spring. Sent by John Tsang, an immunologist at Yale, the text came after his lab had put my blood through a mind-boggling array of newfangled tests. The result—think of it as a full-body, high-resolution CT scan of my immune system—would reveal more about the state of my health than any test I had ever taken. And it could potentially tell me far more than I wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“David,” the text read, “you are the red dot.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang was referring to an image he had attached to the text that showed a graph with a scattering of black dots representing other people whose immune systems had been evaluated—and a lone red one. There also was a score: 0.35.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had no idea what any of this meant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The red dot was the culmination of an immuno-quest I had begun on an autumn afternoon a few months earlier, when a postdoc in Tsang’s lab drew several vials of my blood. It was also a significant milestone in a decades-long journey I’ve taken as a journalist covering life sciences and medicine. Over the years, I’ve offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. In 2001, I was one of the first humans to have my DNA sequenced. Soon after, in the early 2000s, researchers tapped into my proteome—proteins circulating in my blood. Then came assessments of my microbiome, metabolome, and much more. I have continued to test-drive the latest protocols and devices, amassing tens of terabytes of data on myself, and I’ve reported on the results in dozens of articles and a book called &lt;em&gt;Experimental Man&lt;/em&gt;. Over time, the tests have gotten better and more informative, but no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health than what John Tsang was offering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the years, I’ve offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. But no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It also was not lost on me that I’m now 20-plus years older than I was when I took those first tests. Back in my 40s, I was ridiculously healthy. Since then, I’ve been battered by various pathogens, stresses, and injuries, including two bouts of covid and long covid—and, well, life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I’d kept my apprehensions to myself as Tsang, a slim, perpetually smiling man who directs the Yale Center for Systems and Engineering Immunology, invited me into his office in New Haven to introduce me to something called the &lt;em&gt;human immunome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="John Tsang in his office" class="wp-image-1125391" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tsang-e1759947989880.jpg?w=2691" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;John Tsang has helped create a new test for your immune system.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JULIE BIDWELL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Made up of 1.8 trillion cells and trillions more proteins, metabolites, mRNA, and other biomolecules, every person’s immunome is different, and it is constantly changing. It’s shaped by our DNA, past illnesses, the air we have breathed, the food we have eaten, our age, and the traumas and stresses we have experienced—in short, everything we have ever been exposed to physically and emotionally. Right now, your immune system is hard at work identifying and fending off viruses and rogue cells that threaten to turn cancerous—or maybe already have. And it is doing an excellent job of it all, or not, depending on how healthy it happens to be at this particular moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet as critical as the immunome is to each of us, this universe of cells and molecules has remained largely beyond the reach of modern medicine—a vast yet inaccessible operating system that powerfully influences everything from our vulnerability to viruses and cancer to how well we age to whether we tolerate certain foods better than others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to a slew of new technologies and to scientists like Tsang, who is on the Steering Committee of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub New York, understanding this vital and mysterious system is within our grasp, paving the way for powerful new tools and tests to help us better assess, diagnose and treat diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Already, new research is revealing patterns in the ways our bodies respond to stress and disease. Scientists are creating contrasting portraits of weak and robust immunomes—portraits that someday, it’s hoped, could offer new insights into patient care and perhaps detect illnesses before symptoms appear. There are plans afoot to deploy this knowledge and technology on a global scale, which would enable scientists to observe the effects of climate, geography, and countless other factors on the immunome. The results could transform what it means to be healthy and how we identify and treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all begins with a test that can tell you whether your immune system is healthy or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reading the immunome&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sitting in his office last fall, Tsang—a systems immunologist whose expertise combines computer science and immunology— began my tutorial in immunomics by introducing me to a study that he and his team wrote up in a 2024 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. It described the results of measurements made on blood samples taken from 270 subjects—tests similar to the ones Tsang’s team would be running on me. In the study, Tsang and his colleagues looked at the immune systems of 228 patients diagnosed with a variety of genetic disorders and a control group of 42 healthy people.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To help me visualize what my results might look like, Tsang opened his laptop to reveal several colorful charts from the study, punctuated by black dots representing each person evaluated. The results reminded me vaguely of abstract paintings by Joan Miró. But in place of colorful splotches, whirls, and circles were an assortment of scatter plots, Gantt charts, and heat maps tinted in greens, blues, oranges, and purples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all looked like gibberish to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, Tsang was willing to serve as my guide. Flashing his perpetually patient smile, he explained that these colorful jumbles depicted what his team had uncovered about each subject after taking blood samples and assessing the details of how well their immune cells, proteins, mRNA, and other immune system components were doing their job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125389" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spot_2A_color_v1.jpg?w=2549" width="2549" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;IBRAHIM RAYINTAKATH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results placed people—represented by the individual dots—on a left-to-right continuum, ranging from those with unhealthy immunomes on the left to those with healthy immunomes on the right. Background colors, meanwhile, were used to identify people with different medical conditions affecting their immune systems. For example, olive-green indicated those with auto-immune disorders; orange backgrounds were designated for individuals with no known disease history. Tsang said he and his team would be placing me on a similar graph after they finished analyzing my blood.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. “The main immune cell panel typically ordered by a physician is called a CBC differential,” he told me. CBC, which stands for “complete blood count,” is a decades-old type of analysis that counts levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and basic immune cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils). Changes in these levels can indicate whether a person’s immune system might be reacting to a virus or other infection, cancer, or something else. Other blood tests—like one that looks for elevated levels of C-reactive protein, which can indicate inflammation associated with heart disease—are more specific than the CBC. But they still rely on blunt counting—in this case of certain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s assessment, by contrast, tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules—significantly more than the CBC and others. His protocol is designed to paint a more holistic portrait of a person’s immune system by not only counting cells and molecules but also by assessing their interactions. The CBC “doesn’t tell me as a physician what the cells being counted are doing,” says Rachel Sparks, a clinical immunologist who was the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study and is now a translational medicine physician with the drug giant AstraZeneca. “I just know that there are more neutrophils than normal, which may or may not indicate that they’re behaving badly. We now have technology that allows us to see at a granular level what a cell is actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; when a virus appears—how it’s changing and reacting.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsang’s measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. His assessment tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such breakthroughs have been made possible thanks to a raft of new and improved technologies that have evolved over the past decade, allowing scientists like Tsang and Sparks to explore the intricacies of the immunome with newfound precision. These include devices that can count myriad different types of cells and biomolecules, as well as advanced sequencers that identify and characterize DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules. There are now instruments that also can measure thousands of changes and reactions that occur inside a single immune cell as it reacts to a virus or other threat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang and Spark’s’ team used data generated by such measurements to identify and characterize a series of signals distinctive to unhealthy immune systems. Then they used the presence or absence of these signals to create a numerical assessment of the health of a person’s immunome—a score they call an “immune health metric,” or IHM.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rachel Sparks outdoors in a green space" class="wp-image-1125388" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sparks-e1759947971712.jpg?w=2680" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Clinical immunologist Rachel Sparks hopes new tests can improve medical care. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JARED SOARES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make sense of the crush of data being collected, Tsang’s team used machine-learning algorithms that correlated the results of the many measurements with a patient’s known health status and age. They also used AI to compare their findings with immune system data collected elsewhere. All this allowed them to determine and validate an IHM score for each person, and to place it on their spectrum, identifying that person as healthy or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all came together for the first time with the publication of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; paper, in which Tsang and his colleagues reported the results from testing multiple immune variables in the 270 subjects. They also announced a remarkable discovery: Patients with different kinds of diseases reacted with similar disruptions to their immunomes. For instance, many showed a lower level of the aptly named natural killer immune cells, regardless of what they were suffering from. Critically, the immune profiles of those with diagnosed diseases tended to look very different from those belonging to the outwardly healthy people in the study. And, as expected, immune health declined in the older patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then the results got &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting. In a few cases, the immune systems of &amp;nbsp;unhealthy and healthy people looked similar, with some people appearing near the “healthy” area of the chart even though they were known to have diseases. Most likely this was because their symptoms were in remission and not causing an immune reaction at the moment when their blood was drawn, Tsang told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other cases, people without a known disease showed up on the chart closer to those who were known to be sick. “Some of these people who appear to be in good health are overlapping with pathology that traditional metrics can’t spot,” says Tsang, whose &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; paper reported that roughly half the healthy individuals in the study had IHM scores that overlapped with those of people known to be sick. Either these seemingly healthy people had normal immune systems that were busy fending off, say, a passing virus, or&amp;nbsp; their immune systems had been impacted by aging and the vicissitudes of life. Potentially more worrisome, they were harboring an illness or stress that was not yet making them ill but might do so eventually.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These findings have obvious implications for medicine. Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize. IHM-style evaluations could also provide clues as to why some people respond differently to viruses like the one that causes covid, and why vaccines—which are designed to activate a healthy immune system—might not work as well in people whose immune systems are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“One of the more surprising things about the last pandemic was that all sorts of random younger people who seemed very healthy got sick and then they were gone,” says Mark Davis, a Stanford immunologist who helped pioneer the science being developed in labs like Tsang’s. “Some had underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes, but some did not. So the question is, could we have pointed out that something was off with these folks’ immune systems? Could we have diagnosed that and warned people to take extra precautions?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s IHM test is designed to answer a simple question: What is the relative health of your immune system? But there are other assessments being developed to provide more detailed information on how the body is doing. Tsang’s own team is working on a panel of additional scores aimed at getting finer detail on specific immune conditions. These include a test that measures the health of a person’s bone marrow, which makes immune cells. “If you have a bone marrow stress or inflammatory condition in the bone marrow, you could have lower capacity to produce cells, which will be reflected by this score,” he says. Another detailed metric will measure protein levels to predict how a person will respond to a virus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang hopes that an IHM-style test will one day be part of a standard physical exam—a snapshot of a patient’s immune system that could inform care. For instance, has a period of intense stress compromised the immune system, making it less able to fend off this season’s flu? Will someone’s score predict a better or worse response to a vaccine or a cancer drug? How does a person’s immune system change with age?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Or, as I anxiously wondered while waiting to learn my own score, will the results reveal an underlying disorder or disease, silently ticking away until it shows itself?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a human immunome project&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The quest to create advanced tests like the IHM for the immune system began more than 15 years ago, when scientists like Mark Davis became frustrated with a field in which research—primarily in mice—was focused mostly on individual immune cells and proteins. In 2007 he launched the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center, one of the first efforts to conceptualize the human immunome as a holistic, body-wide network in human beings. Speaking by Zoom from his office in Palo Alto, California, Davis told me that the effort had spawned other projects, including a landmark twin study showing that a lot of immune variation is not genetic, which was then the prevailing theory, but is heavily influenced by environmental factors—a major shift in scientists’ understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shai Shen-Orr" class="wp-image-1125387" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shenn-Orr-e1759941355132.jpg?w=2055" width="2005" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Shai Shen-Orr sees a day when people will check their immune scores on an app. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SHAI SHEN-ORR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davis and others also laid the groundwork for tests like John Tsang’s by discovering how a T cell—among the most common and important immune players—can recognize pathogens, cancerous cells, and other threats, triggering defensive measures that can include destroying the threat. This and other discoveries have revealed many of the basic mechanics of how immune cells work, says Davis, “but there’s still a lot we have to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One researcher working with Davis in those early days was Shai Shen-Orr, who is now director of the Zimin Institute for AI Solutions in Healthcare at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, based in Haifa, Israel. (He’s also a frequent collaborator with Tsang.) Shen-Orr, like Tsang, is a systems immunologist. He recalls that in 2007, when he was a postdoc in Davis’s lab, immunologists had identified around 100 cell types and a similar number of cytokines—proteins that act as messengers in the immune system. But they weren’t able to measure them simultaneously, which limited visibility into how the immune system works as a whole. Today, Shen-Orr says, immunologists can measure hundreds of cell types and thousands of proteins and watch them interact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shen-Orr’s current lab has developed its own version of an immunome test that he calls IMM-AGE (short for “immune age”), the basics of which were published in a 2019 paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. IMM-AGE looks at the composition of people’s immune systems—how many of each type of immune cell they have and how these numbers change as they age. His team has used this information primarily to ascertain a person’s risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shen-Orr also has been a vociferous advocate for expanding the pool of test samples, which now come mostly from Americans and Europeans. “We need to understand why different people in different environments react differently and how that works,” he says. “We also need to test a lot more people—maybe millions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang has seen why a limited sample size can pose problems. In 2013, he says, researchers at the National Institutes of Health came up with a malaria vaccine that was effective for almost everyone who got it during clinical trials conducted in Maryland. “But in Africa,” he says, “it only worked for about 25% of the people.” He attributes this to the significant differences in genetics, diet, climate, and other environmental factors that cause people’s immunomes to develop differently. “Why?” he asks. “What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That’s what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That’s what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John Tsang&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For several years, Tsang and Shen-Orr have advocated going global with testing, “but there has been resistance,” Shen-Orr says. “Look, medicine is conservative and moves slowly, and the technology is expensive and labor intensive.” They finally got the audience they needed at a 2022 conference in La Jolla, California, convened by the Human Immunome Project, or HIP. (The organization was originally founded in 2016 to create more effective vaccines but had recently changed its name to emphasize a pivot from just vaccines to the wider field of immunome science.) It was in La Jolla that they met HIP’s then-new chairperson, Jane Metcalfe, a cofounder of &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine, who saw what was at stake.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We’ve got all of these advanced molecular immunological profiles being developed,” she said, “but we can’t begin to predict the breadth of immune system variability if we’re&amp;nbsp; only testing small numbers of people in Palo Alto or Tel Aviv. And that’s when the big aha moment struck us that we need sites everywhere to collect that information so we can build proper computer models and a predictive understanding of the human immune system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125390" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spot_2B_color_v1.jpg?w=2549" width="2549" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;IBRAHIM RAYINTAKATH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following that meeting, HIP created a new scientific plan, with Tsang and Shen-Orr as chief science officers. The group set an ambitious goal of raising around $3 billion over the next 10 years—a goal Tsang and Metcalfe say will be met by working in conjunction with a broad network of public and private supporters. Cutbacks in federal funding for biomedical research in the US may limit funds from this traditional source, but HIP plans to work with government agencies outside the US too, with the goal of creating a comprehensive global immunological database.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HIP’s plan is to first develop a pilot version based on Tsang’s test, which it will call the Immune Monitoring Kit, to test a few thousand people in Africa, Australia, East Asia, Europe, the US, and Israel. The initial effort, according to Metcalfe, is expected to begin by the end of the year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After that, HIP would like to expand to some 150 sites around the world, eventually assessing about 250,000 people and collecting a vast cache of data and insights that Tsang believes will profoundly affect—even revolutionize—clinical medicine, public health, and drug development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;My immune health metric score is …&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As HIP develops its pilot study to take on the world, John Tsang, for better or worse, has added one more North American Caucasian male to the small number of people who have received an IHM score to date. That would be me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took a long time to get my score, but Tsang didn’t leave me hanging once he pinged me the red dot. “We plotted you with other participants who are clinically quite healthy,” he texted, referring to a cluster of black dots on the grid he had sent, although he cautioned that the group I’m being compared with includes only a few dozen people. “Higher IHM means better immune health,” he wrote, referring to my 0.35 score, which he described as a number on an arbitrary scale. “As you can see, your IHM is right in the middle of a bunch of people 20 years younger.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was a relief, given that our immune system, like so many other bodily functions, declines with age—though obviously at different rates. Yet I also felt a certain disappointment. To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn’t. Tsang and other scientists are working on ways to extract more specific information from the tests. Still, he insists that the single score itself is a powerful tool to understand the general state of our immunomes, indicating the absence or presence of underlying health issues that might not be revealed in traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Tsang what my score meant for my future. “Your score is always changing depending on what you’re exposed to and due to age,” he said, adding that the IHM is still so new that it’s hard to know exactly what the score means until researchers do more work—and until HIP can evaluate and compare thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. They also need to keep testing me over time to see how my immune system changes as it’s exposed to new perturbations and stresses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For now, I’m left with a simple number. Though it tells me little about the detailed workings of my immune system, the good news is that it raises no red flags. My immune system, it turns out, is pretty healthy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days after receiving my score from Tsang, I heard from Shen-Orr about more results. Tsang had shared my data with his lab so that he could run his IMM-AGE protocol on my immunome and provide me with another score to worry about. Shen-Orr’s result put the age of my immune system at around 57—still 10 years younger than my true age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The c&lt;/strong&gt;oming age of the immunome&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shai Shen-Orr imagines a day when people will be able to check their advanced IHM and IMM-AGE scores—or their HIP Immune Monitoring Kit score—on an app after a blood draw, the way they now check health data such as heart rate and blood pressure. Jane Metcalfe talks about linking IHM-type measurements and analyses with rising global temperatures and steamier days and nights to study how global warming might affect the immune system of, say, a newborn or a pregnant woman. “This could be plugged into other people’s models and really help us understand the effects of pollution, nutrition, or climate change on human health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think [in 10 years] I’ll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients. And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Rachel Sparks&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other clues could also be on the horizon. “At some point we’ll have IHM scores that can provide data on who will be most affected by a virus during a pandemic,” Tsang says. Maybe that will help researchers engineer an immune system response that shuts down the virus before it spreads. He says it’s possible to run a test like that now, but it remains experimental and will take years to fully develop, test for safety and accuracy, and establish standards and protocols for use as a tool of global public health. “These things take a long time,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same goes for bringing IHM-style tests into the exam room, so doctors like Rachel Sparks can use the results to help treat their patients. “I think in 10 years, with some effort, we really could have something useful,” says Stanford’s Mark Davis. Sparks agrees. “I think by then I’ll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients,” she says. “And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ll wait for more details with a mix of impatience, curiosity, and at least a hint of concern. I wonder what more the immune circuitry deep inside me might reveal about whether I’m healthy at this very moment, or will be tomorrow, or next month, or years from now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Ewing Duncan&amp;nbsp;is an award-winning science writer.

Sent by John Tsang, an immunologist at Yale, the text came after his lab had put my blood through a mind-boggling array of newfangled tests. The result—think of it as a full-body, high-resolution CT scan of my immune system—would reveal more about the state of my health than any test I had ever taken. And it could potentially tell me far more than I wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“David,” the text read, “you are the red dot.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang was referring to an image he had attached to the text that showed a graph with a scattering of black dots representing other people whose immune systems had been evaluated—and a lone red one. There also was a score: 0.35.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had no idea what any of this meant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The red dot was the culmination of an immuno-quest I had begun on an autumn afternoon a few months earlier, when a postdoc in Tsang’s lab drew several vials of my blood. It was also a significant milestone in a decades-long journey I’ve taken as a journalist covering life sciences and medicine. Over the years, I’ve offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. In 2001, I was one of the first humans to have my DNA sequenced. Soon after, in the early 2000s, researchers tapped into my proteome—proteins circulating in my blood. Then came assessments of my microbiome, metabolome, and much more. I have continued to test-drive the latest protocols and devices, amassing tens of terabytes of data on myself, and I’ve reported on the results in dozens of articles and a book called &lt;em&gt;Experimental Man&lt;/em&gt;. Over time, the tests have gotten better and more informative, but no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health than what John Tsang was offering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the years, I’ve offered myself up as a human guinea pig for hundreds of tests promising new insights into my health and mortality. But no test I had previously taken promised to deliver results more comprehensive or closer to revealing the truth about my underlying state of health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It also was not lost on me that I’m now 20-plus years older than I was when I took those first tests. Back in my 40s, I was ridiculously healthy. Since then, I’ve been battered by various pathogens, stresses, and injuries, including two bouts of covid and long covid—and, well, life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I’d kept my apprehensions to myself as Tsang, a slim, perpetually smiling man who directs the Yale Center for Systems and Engineering Immunology, invited me into his office in New Haven to introduce me to something called the &lt;em&gt;human immunome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="John Tsang in his office" class="wp-image-1125391" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tsang-e1759947989880.jpg?w=2691" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;John Tsang has helped create a new test for your immune system.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JULIE BIDWELL&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Made up of 1.8 trillion cells and trillions more proteins, metabolites, mRNA, and other biomolecules, every person’s immunome is different, and it is constantly changing. It’s shaped by our DNA, past illnesses, the air we have breathed, the food we have eaten, our age, and the traumas and stresses we have experienced—in short, everything we have ever been exposed to physically and emotionally. Right now, your immune system is hard at work identifying and fending off viruses and rogue cells that threaten to turn cancerous—or maybe already have. And it is doing an excellent job of it all, or not, depending on how healthy it happens to be at this particular moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet as critical as the immunome is to each of us, this universe of cells and molecules has remained largely beyond the reach of modern medicine—a vast yet inaccessible operating system that powerfully influences everything from our vulnerability to viruses and cancer to how well we age to whether we tolerate certain foods better than others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to a slew of new technologies and to scientists like Tsang, who is on the Steering Committee of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub New York, understanding this vital and mysterious system is within our grasp, paving the way for powerful new tools and tests to help us better assess, diagnose and treat diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Already, new research is revealing patterns in the ways our bodies respond to stress and disease. Scientists are creating contrasting portraits of weak and robust immunomes—portraits that someday, it’s hoped, could offer new insights into patient care and perhaps detect illnesses before symptoms appear. There are plans afoot to deploy this knowledge and technology on a global scale, which would enable scientists to observe the effects of climate, geography, and countless other factors on the immunome. The results could transform what it means to be healthy and how we identify and treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all begins with a test that can tell you whether your immune system is healthy or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reading the immunome&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sitting in his office last fall, Tsang—a systems immunologist whose expertise combines computer science and immunology— began my tutorial in immunomics by introducing me to a study that he and his team wrote up in a 2024 paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. It described the results of measurements made on blood samples taken from 270 subjects—tests similar to the ones Tsang’s team would be running on me. In the study, Tsang and his colleagues looked at the immune systems of 228 patients diagnosed with a variety of genetic disorders and a control group of 42 healthy people.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To help me visualize what my results might look like, Tsang opened his laptop to reveal several colorful charts from the study, punctuated by black dots representing each person evaluated. The results reminded me vaguely of abstract paintings by Joan Miró. But in place of colorful splotches, whirls, and circles were an assortment of scatter plots, Gantt charts, and heat maps tinted in greens, blues, oranges, and purples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all looked like gibberish to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, Tsang was willing to serve as my guide. Flashing his perpetually patient smile, he explained that these colorful jumbles depicted what his team had uncovered about each subject after taking blood samples and assessing the details of how well their immune cells, proteins, mRNA, and other immune system components were doing their job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125389" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spot_2A_color_v1.jpg?w=2549" width="2549" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;IBRAHIM RAYINTAKATH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results placed people—represented by the individual dots—on a left-to-right continuum, ranging from those with unhealthy immunomes on the left to those with healthy immunomes on the right. Background colors, meanwhile, were used to identify people with different medical conditions affecting their immune systems. For example, olive-green indicated those with auto-immune disorders; orange backgrounds were designated for individuals with no known disease history. Tsang said he and his team would be placing me on a similar graph after they finished analyzing my blood.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. “The main immune cell panel typically ordered by a physician is called a CBC differential,” he told me. CBC, which stands for “complete blood count,” is a decades-old type of analysis that counts levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and basic immune cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils). Changes in these levels can indicate whether a person’s immune system might be reacting to a virus or other infection, cancer, or something else. Other blood tests—like one that looks for elevated levels of C-reactive protein, which can indicate inflammation associated with heart disease—are more specific than the CBC. But they still rely on blunt counting—in this case of certain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s assessment, by contrast, tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules—significantly more than the CBC and others. His protocol is designed to paint a more holistic portrait of a person’s immune system by not only counting cells and molecules but also by assessing their interactions. The CBC “doesn’t tell me as a physician what the cells being counted are doing,” says Rachel Sparks, a clinical immunologist who was the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study and is now a translational medicine physician with the drug giant AstraZeneca. “I just know that there are more neutrophils than normal, which may or may not indicate that they’re behaving badly. We now have technology that allows us to see at a granular level what a cell is actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; when a virus appears—how it’s changing and reacting.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsang’s measurements go significantly beyond what can be discerned from the handful of immune biomarkers that people routinely get tested for today. His assessment tests up to a million cells, proteins, mRNA and immune biomolecules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such breakthroughs have been made possible thanks to a raft of new and improved technologies that have evolved over the past decade, allowing scientists like Tsang and Sparks to explore the intricacies of the immunome with newfound precision. These include devices that can count myriad different types of cells and biomolecules, as well as advanced sequencers that identify and characterize DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules. There are now instruments that also can measure thousands of changes and reactions that occur inside a single immune cell as it reacts to a virus or other threat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang and Spark’s’ team used data generated by such measurements to identify and characterize a series of signals distinctive to unhealthy immune systems. Then they used the presence or absence of these signals to create a numerical assessment of the health of a person’s immunome—a score they call an “immune health metric,” or IHM.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rachel Sparks outdoors in a green space" class="wp-image-1125388" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sparks-e1759947971712.jpg?w=2680" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Clinical immunologist Rachel Sparks hopes new tests can improve medical care. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JARED SOARES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make sense of the crush of data being collected, Tsang’s team used machine-learning algorithms that correlated the results of the many measurements with a patient’s known health status and age. They also used AI to compare their findings with immune system data collected elsewhere. All this allowed them to determine and validate an IHM score for each person, and to place it on their spectrum, identifying that person as healthy or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It all came together for the first time with the publication of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; paper, in which Tsang and his colleagues reported the results from testing multiple immune variables in the 270 subjects. They also announced a remarkable discovery: Patients with different kinds of diseases reacted with similar disruptions to their immunomes. For instance, many showed a lower level of the aptly named natural killer immune cells, regardless of what they were suffering from. Critically, the immune profiles of those with diagnosed diseases tended to look very different from those belonging to the outwardly healthy people in the study. And, as expected, immune health declined in the older patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then the results got &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting. In a few cases, the immune systems of &amp;nbsp;unhealthy and healthy people looked similar, with some people appearing near the “healthy” area of the chart even though they were known to have diseases. Most likely this was because their symptoms were in remission and not causing an immune reaction at the moment when their blood was drawn, Tsang told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other cases, people without a known disease showed up on the chart closer to those who were known to be sick. “Some of these people who appear to be in good health are overlapping with pathology that traditional metrics can’t spot,” says Tsang, whose &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; paper reported that roughly half the healthy individuals in the study had IHM scores that overlapped with those of people known to be sick. Either these seemingly healthy people had normal immune systems that were busy fending off, say, a passing virus, or&amp;nbsp; their immune systems had been impacted by aging and the vicissitudes of life. Potentially more worrisome, they were harboring an illness or stress that was not yet making them ill but might do so eventually.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These findings have obvious implications for medicine. Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize. IHM-style evaluations could also provide clues as to why some people respond differently to viruses like the one that causes covid, and why vaccines—which are designed to activate a healthy immune system—might not work as well in people whose immune systems are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotting a low immune score in a seemingly healthy person could make it possible to identify and start treating an illness before symptoms appear, diseases worsen, or tumors grow and metastasize.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“One of the more surprising things about the last pandemic was that all sorts of random younger people who seemed very healthy got sick and then they were gone,” says Mark Davis, a Stanford immunologist who helped pioneer the science being developed in labs like Tsang’s. “Some had underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes, but some did not. So the question is, could we have pointed out that something was off with these folks’ immune systems? Could we have diagnosed that and warned people to take extra precautions?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Tsang’s IHM test is designed to answer a simple question: What is the relative health of your immune system? But there are other assessments being developed to provide more detailed information on how the body is doing. Tsang’s own team is working on a panel of additional scores aimed at getting finer detail on specific immune conditions. These include a test that measures the health of a person’s bone marrow, which makes immune cells. “If you have a bone marrow stress or inflammatory condition in the bone marrow, you could have lower capacity to produce cells, which will be reflected by this score,” he says. Another detailed metric will measure protein levels to predict how a person will respond to a virus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang hopes that an IHM-style test will one day be part of a standard physical exam—a snapshot of a patient’s immune system that could inform care. For instance, has a period of intense stress compromised the immune system, making it less able to fend off this season’s flu? Will someone’s score predict a better or worse response to a vaccine or a cancer drug? How does a person’s immune system change with age?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Or, as I anxiously wondered while waiting to learn my own score, will the results reveal an underlying disorder or disease, silently ticking away until it shows itself?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a human immunome project&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The quest to create advanced tests like the IHM for the immune system began more than 15 years ago, when scientists like Mark Davis became frustrated with a field in which research—primarily in mice—was focused mostly on individual immune cells and proteins. In 2007 he launched the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center, one of the first efforts to conceptualize the human immunome as a holistic, body-wide network in human beings. Speaking by Zoom from his office in Palo Alto, California, Davis told me that the effort had spawned other projects, including a landmark twin study showing that a lot of immune variation is not genetic, which was then the prevailing theory, but is heavily influenced by environmental factors—a major shift in scientists’ understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shai Shen-Orr" class="wp-image-1125387" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shenn-Orr-e1759941355132.jpg?w=2055" width="2005" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Shai Shen-Orr sees a day when people will check their immune scores on an app. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SHAI SHEN-ORR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davis and others also laid the groundwork for tests like John Tsang’s by discovering how a T cell—among the most common and important immune players—can recognize pathogens, cancerous cells, and other threats, triggering defensive measures that can include destroying the threat. This and other discoveries have revealed many of the basic mechanics of how immune cells work, says Davis, “but there’s still a lot we have to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One researcher working with Davis in those early days was Shai Shen-Orr, who is now director of the Zimin Institute for AI Solutions in Healthcare at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, based in Haifa, Israel. (He’s also a frequent collaborator with Tsang.) Shen-Orr, like Tsang, is a systems immunologist. He recalls that in 2007, when he was a postdoc in Davis’s lab, immunologists had identified around 100 cell types and a similar number of cytokines—proteins that act as messengers in the immune system. But they weren’t able to measure them simultaneously, which limited visibility into how the immune system works as a whole. Today, Shen-Orr says, immunologists can measure hundreds of cell types and thousands of proteins and watch them interact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shen-Orr’s current lab has developed its own version of an immunome test that he calls IMM-AGE (short for “immune age”), the basics of which were published in a 2019 paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. IMM-AGE looks at the composition of people’s immune systems—how many of each type of immune cell they have and how these numbers change as they age. His team has used this information primarily to ascertain a person’s risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shen-Orr also has been a vociferous advocate for expanding the pool of test samples, which now come mostly from Americans and Europeans. “We need to understand why different people in different environments react differently and how that works,” he says. “We also need to test a lot more people—maybe millions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang has seen why a limited sample size can pose problems. In 2013, he says, researchers at the National Institutes of Health came up with a malaria vaccine that was effective for almost everyone who got it during clinical trials conducted in Maryland. “But in Africa,” he says, “it only worked for about 25% of the people.” He attributes this to the significant differences in genetics, diet, climate, and other environmental factors that cause people’s immunomes to develop differently. “Why?” he asks. “What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That’s what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What exactly was different about the immune systems in Maryland and Tanzania? That’s what we need to understand so we can design personalized vaccines and treatments.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John Tsang&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For several years, Tsang and Shen-Orr have advocated going global with testing, “but there has been resistance,” Shen-Orr says. “Look, medicine is conservative and moves slowly, and the technology is expensive and labor intensive.” They finally got the audience they needed at a 2022 conference in La Jolla, California, convened by the Human Immunome Project, or HIP. (The organization was originally founded in 2016 to create more effective vaccines but had recently changed its name to emphasize a pivot from just vaccines to the wider field of immunome science.) It was in La Jolla that they met HIP’s then-new chairperson, Jane Metcalfe, a cofounder of &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine, who saw what was at stake.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We’ve got all of these advanced molecular immunological profiles being developed,” she said, “but we can’t begin to predict the breadth of immune system variability if we’re&amp;nbsp; only testing small numbers of people in Palo Alto or Tel Aviv. And that’s when the big aha moment struck us that we need sites everywhere to collect that information so we can build proper computer models and a predictive understanding of the human immune system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125390" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Spot_2B_color_v1.jpg?w=2549" width="2549" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;IBRAHIM RAYINTAKATH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following that meeting, HIP created a new scientific plan, with Tsang and Shen-Orr as chief science officers. The group set an ambitious goal of raising around $3 billion over the next 10 years—a goal Tsang and Metcalfe say will be met by working in conjunction with a broad network of public and private supporters. Cutbacks in federal funding for biomedical research in the US may limit funds from this traditional source, but HIP plans to work with government agencies outside the US too, with the goal of creating a comprehensive global immunological database.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HIP’s plan is to first develop a pilot version based on Tsang’s test, which it will call the Immune Monitoring Kit, to test a few thousand people in Africa, Australia, East Asia, Europe, the US, and Israel. The initial effort, according to Metcalfe, is expected to begin by the end of the year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After that, HIP would like to expand to some 150 sites around the world, eventually assessing about 250,000 people and collecting a vast cache of data and insights that Tsang believes will profoundly affect—even revolutionize—clinical medicine, public health, and drug development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;My immune health metric score is …&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As HIP develops its pilot study to take on the world, John Tsang, for better or worse, has added one more North American Caucasian male to the small number of people who have received an IHM score to date. That would be me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took a long time to get my score, but Tsang didn’t leave me hanging once he pinged me the red dot. “We plotted you with other participants who are clinically quite healthy,” he texted, referring to a cluster of black dots on the grid he had sent, although he cautioned that the group I’m being compared with includes only a few dozen people. “Higher IHM means better immune health,” he wrote, referring to my 0.35 score, which he described as a number on an arbitrary scale. “As you can see, your IHM is right in the middle of a bunch of people 20 years younger.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was a relief, given that our immune system, like so many other bodily functions, declines with age—though obviously at different rates. Yet I also felt a certain disappointment. To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn’t. Tsang and other scientists are working on ways to extract more specific information from the tests. Still, he insists that the single score itself is a powerful tool to understand the general state of our immunomes, indicating the absence or presence of underlying health issues that might not be revealed in traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be honest, I had expected more granular detail after having a million or so cells and markers tested—like perhaps some insights on why I got long covid (twice) and others didn’t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Tsang what my score meant for my future. “Your score is always changing depending on what you’re exposed to and due to age,” he said, adding that the IHM is still so new that it’s hard to know exactly what the score means until researchers do more work—and until HIP can evaluate and compare thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. They also need to keep testing me over time to see how my immune system changes as it’s exposed to new perturbations and stresses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For now, I’m left with a simple number. Though it tells me little about the detailed workings of my immune system, the good news is that it raises no red flags. My immune system, it turns out, is pretty healthy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few days after receiving my score from Tsang, I heard from Shen-Orr about more results. Tsang had shared my data with his lab so that he could run his IMM-AGE protocol on my immunome and provide me with another score to worry about. Shen-Orr’s result put the age of my immune system at around 57—still 10 years younger than my true age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The c&lt;/strong&gt;oming age of the immunome&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shai Shen-Orr imagines a day when people will be able to check their advanced IHM and IMM-AGE scores—or their HIP Immune Monitoring Kit score—on an app after a blood draw, the way they now check health data such as heart rate and blood pressure. Jane Metcalfe talks about linking IHM-type measurements and analyses with rising global temperatures and steamier days and nights to study how global warming might affect the immune system of, say, a newborn or a pregnant woman. “This could be plugged into other people’s models and really help us understand the effects of pollution, nutrition, or climate change on human health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think [in 10 years] I’ll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients. And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Rachel Sparks&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other clues could also be on the horizon. “At some point we’ll have IHM scores that can provide data on who will be most affected by a virus during a pandemic,” Tsang says. Maybe that will help researchers engineer an immune system response that shuts down the virus before it spreads. He says it’s possible to run a test like that now, but it remains experimental and will take years to fully develop, test for safety and accuracy, and establish standards and protocols for use as a tool of global public health. “These things take a long time,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same goes for bringing IHM-style tests into the exam room, so doctors like Rachel Sparks can use the results to help treat their patients. “I think in 10 years, with some effort, we really could have something useful,” says Stanford’s Mark Davis. Sparks agrees. “I think by then I’ll be able to use this much more granular understanding of what the immune system is doing at the cellular level in my patients,” she says. “And hopefully we could target our therapies more directly to those cells or pathways that are contributing to disease.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ll wait for more details with a mix of impatience, curiosity, and at least a hint of concern. I wonder what more the immune circuitry deep inside me might reveal about whether I’m healthy at this very moment, or will be tomorrow, or next month, or years from now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Ewing Duncan&amp;nbsp;is an award-winning science writer.

This marks the third time we’ve put the list together, and it’s become one of my favorite projects to work on every year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the journalism world, it’s easy to get caught up in the latest news, whether it’s a fundraising round, research paper, or startup failure. Curating this list gives our team a chance to take a step back and consider the broader picture. What industries are making progress or lagging behind? Which countries or regions are seeing quick changes? Who’s likely to succeed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year is an especially interesting moment in the climate tech world, something we grappled with while choosing companies. Here are three of my takeaways from the process of building this list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It’s hard to overstate China’s role in energy technology right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, China’s progress on cleantech is wild. The country is dominating in installing wind and solar power and building EVs, and it’s also pumping government money into emerging technologies like fusion energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We knew we wanted this list to reflect China’s emergence as a global energy superpower, and we ended up including two Chinese firms in key industries: renewables and batteries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, China accounted for the top four wind turbine makers worldwide. Envision was in the second spot, with 19.3 gigawatts of new capacity added last year. But the company isn’t limited to wind; it’s working to help power heavy industries like steel and chemicals with technology like green hydrogen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Batteries are also a hot industry in China, and we’re seeing progress in tech beyond the lithium-ion cells that currently dominate EVs and energy storage on the grid. We represent that industry with HiNa Battery Technology, a leading startup building sodium-ion batteries, which could be cheaper than today’s options. The company’s batteries are already being used in electric mopeds and grid installations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Energy demand from data centers and AI is on everyone’s mind, especially in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another trend we noticed this year was a fixation on the growing energy demand of data centers, including massive planned dedicated facilities that power AI models. (Here’s another nudge to check out our Power Hungry series on AI and energy, in case you haven’t explored it already.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if their technology has nothing to do with data centers, companies are trying to show how they can be valuable in this age of rising energy demand. Some are signing lucrative deals with tech giants that could provide the money needed to help bring their product to market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kairos Power hopes to be one such energy generator, building next-generation nuclear reactors. Last year, the company signed an agreement with Google that will see the company buy up to 500 megawatts of electricity from Kairos’s first reactors through 2035.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a more direct play, Redwood Materials is stringing together used EV batteries to build microgrids that could power—you guessed it—data centers. The company’s first installation fired up this year, and while it’s small, it’s an interesting example of a new use for old technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Materials continue to be an area that’s ripe for innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a new essay that accompanies the list, Bill Gates lays out the key role of innovation in making progress on climate technology. One thing that jumped out at me while I was reading that piece was a number: 30% of global greenhouse-gas emissions come from manufacturing, including cement and steel production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve obviously covered materials and heavy industry for years. But it still strikes me just how much innovation we still need in the most important materials we use to scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several companies on this year’s list focus on materials: We’ve once again represented cement, a material that accounts for 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Cemvision is working to use alternative fuel sources and starting materials to clean up the dirty industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And Cyclic Materials is trying to reclaim and recycle rare earth magnets, a crucial technology that underpins everything from speakers to EVs and wind turbines. Today, only about 0.2% of rare earths from recycled devices are recycled, but the company is building multiple facilities in North America in hopes of changing that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch highlights businesses we think have a shot at helping the world address and adapt to climate change with the help of everything from established energy technologies to novel materials. It’s a representation of this moment, and I hope you enjoy taking a spin through it.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251007-Spark-climate-hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, we published our 2025 edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch.

One thing that jumped out at me while I was reading that piece was a number: 30% of global greenhouse-gas emissions come from manufacturing, including cement and steel production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve obviously covered materials and heavy industry for years. But it still strikes me just how much innovation we still need in the most important materials we use to scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several companies on this year’s list focus on materials: We’ve once again represented cement, a material that accounts for 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Cemvision is working to use alternative fuel sources and starting materials to clean up the dirty industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And Cyclic Materials is trying to reclaim and recycle rare earth magnets, a crucial technology that underpins everything from speakers to EVs and wind turbines. Today, only about 0.2% of rare earths from recycled devices are recycled, but the company is building multiple facilities in North America in hopes of changing that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch highlights businesses we think have a shot at helping the world address and adapt to climate change with the help of everything from established energy technologies to novel materials. It’s a representation of this moment, and I hope you enjoy taking a spin through it.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/09/1125302/3-takeaways-about-climate-tech-right-now/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google ramps up its ‘AI in the workplace’ ambitions with Gemini Enterprise (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/google-ramps-up-its-ai-in-the-workplace-ambitions-with-gemini-enterprise/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gemini-enterprise.jpg?resize=1200,667" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google on Thursday launched a comprehensive AI platform for businesses called Gemini Enterprise, the latest effort by the Alphabet-owned company to compete with Anthropic and OpenAI in the fast-growing market for workplace AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the launch, Google announced several new Gemini Enterprise customers, including the software design firm Figma; the buy-now-pay-later company Klarna; the foodservice distributor Gordon Foods; Australian retail bank Macquarie Bank; and Virgin Voyages, a cruise line that has deployed more than 50 specialized AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks on Gemini Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini Enterprise builds on previous iterations of the company’s efforts to bring AI capabilities to businesses. But Google says this shouldn’t be mistaken as a mere rebranding, despite the ever-changing and sometimes overlapping nomenclature used by its enterprise brand Google Workspace. For instance, Google Workspace adopted the Gemini branding in February 2024 and announced add-on generative AI products called Gemini Enterprise that were available to businesses. Google discontinued that Workspace Gemini Enterprise add-on earlier this year after it began including AI features in its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Gemini Enterprise that launched Thursday isn’t a Workspace add-on product; it’s a separate and secure platform under Google Cloud that that functions as an AI agent toolkit — essentially a suite of tools that lets companies build and deploy their own AI assistants. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian described it in a blog post as “the new front door for AI in the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini Enterprise is designed to let businesses securely create, share, and use AI agents for a variety of workplace tasks in sales, marketing, engineering, human resources, and finance. Google also said that, for the first time, these AI agents can access, combine, and analyze information from internal systems and Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All of this work is conducted through a Gemini Enterprise chatbot that connects to a worker’s data, including Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, as well as business applications like Salesforce and SAP. The platform includes Google’s Gemini AI models alongside other products such as a collection of pre-built Google agents for deep research and data insights, a no-code product that lets workers analyze information and automate internal processes, and a central governance framework that lets users visualize, secure, and audit all of their agents from one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new “front door for AI in the workplace” does have a price. The company said its annual Gemini Enterprise standard and “plus” editions start at $30 per seat per month. A cheaper Gemini Business annual plan, which is meant for small businesses, startups, or individual departments within a larger company, cost $21 per seat per month. Google said the business edition will launch Thursday and includes a 30-day free trial period for all customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini Enterprise reflects Google’s latest effort to capture a bigger share of the enterprise market, which has become increasingly crowded as generative AI becomes a more important workplace tool. Booming AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI have enterprise products, and both have landed high-profile customers.&lt;/p&gt;

It aims to democratise the creation and use of AI-powered agents for automating complex workflows and boosting productivity across entire organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, introduced the new offering, explaining that as customers moved beyond simply building applications with AI, the company saw them “advancing to build agents”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini Enterprise is Google’s answer to this evolution, bundling its entire AI stack into a cohesive user experience that allows developers and business users alike to build agents with a no-code workbench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform is built on six core components. The “brains” are Google’s powerful Gemini models, including the newly available Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. The “workbench” is the agent creation and orchestration technology pioneered with Agentspace, allowing any user to manage agents and automate processes. Finally, this is complemented by the “taskforce,” a suite of pre-built Google agents for specialised jobs like the new Code Assist Agent and the Deep Research Agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make these agents effective, there is deep integration with a company’s data through new connectors for systems like Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Box, Confluence, and Jira. Kurian explained the system’s intelligence, stating, “We remember who you are and what you do and use it to personalise the context you have when we work with a large language model”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central “governance” framework allows organisations to monitor, secure, and audit all agents from one place, with protections like Model Armor now built-in. Finally, the platform is built on an open “ecosystem” of over 100,000 partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gemini-enterprise-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-work"&gt;Gemini Enterprise: A glimpse into the future of work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the platform’s capabilities, Maryam Gholami walked through a practical use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The beauty of Gemini Enterprise is that it offers the familiar interface of the Gemini but built for enterprise workflows, including full control to enable or disable any of the sources as needed,” Gholami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a custom ‘campaigns agent’, she used four different agents to handle market research, media generation, team communications, and inventory management. The agent identified a market trend towards sci-fi themes, flagged a 25 percent inventory gap, created a purchase order in ServiceNow, drafted an email to store managers, and generated social media assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gemini Enterprise is more than just a chat interface,” Gholami concluded after the demonstration. “It’s an end-to-end AI system that unifies your data, your tools, and your teams, turning weeks of complex work into a single, streamlined conversation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Example of an AI agent for marketing using Google Cloud Gemini Enterprise." class="wp-image-109827" height="540" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-cloud-gemini-enterprise-marketing.gif" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-customers-drive-transformation-with-ai-fleets"&gt;Customers drive transformation with AI fleets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proving the platform’s real-world value, Nirmal Saverimuttu, CEO of Virgin Voyages, shared his perspective that “any major disruption like AI requires a cultural transformation to be successful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Saverimuttu stressed that AI’s role is to work alongside, not replace, his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our people are our biggest asset. AI. And never replace our people,” he stated. “To me, AI is about getting the best from our people. It’s about unleashing human potential”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cruise line has deployed a fleet of over 50 specialised AI agents company-wide. The first, ‘Email Ellie’, has boosted content production speed by 40 percent and contributed to a 28 percent year-over-year increase in July sales. Saverimuttu also noted welcome operational gains, including a “35 percent reduction in agency dependency costs, resulting in creative independence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another early adopter is Macquarie Bank. The bank, one of Australia’s largest, has rolled out Gemini Enterprise to every employee and reports that 99 percent of its staff have already completed generative AI training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google emphasised that Gemini Enterprise is an open platform, with partners like Box, Salesforce, and ServiceNow announcing compatible agents. A new AI agent finder will also help customers discover thousands of validated partner solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support adoption, Google has also launched Google Skills, a new free learning platform with 3,000 courses. As part of this, the company announced the Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) program; an educational sprint designed to enable one million developers to build and deploy agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-and-availability-of-gemini-enterprise"&gt;Pricing and availability of Gemini Enterprise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini Enterprise is available globally in all countries where Google Cloud products are sold.
