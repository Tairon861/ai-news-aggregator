&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2021, Gupshup raised two funding rounds within four months, securing $340 million from prominent investors including Tiger Global, Fidelity Management, Think Investments, and Malabar Investments. These rounds — the startup’s first in roughly a decade — valued Gupshup at $1.4 billion. However, Fidelity, which led the round following its unicorn milestone, slashed its internal valuation of the startup at least three times between 2023 and 2024, bringing it down to as low as $486 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new funding round, which combines equity and debt financing from Globespan Capital Partners and EvolutionX Debt Capital, aims to help the San Francisco-headquartered startup expand its presence across its high-growth markets, including India, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup would not reveal the exact debt portion although its founder and CEO Beerud Seth told TechCrunch that the equity part is “a little more than half.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2004, Gupshup — derived from Indian slang meaning “conversations” — started as a platform to help businesses connect with their customers through text messages. It gained popularity as text messages were not free at the time, and people were seeking ways to send messages to their friends and community groups. However, as communication shifted from short messaging service (SMS) to WhatsApp and Rich Communication Services (RCS), the startup moved to these avenues with its chatbot services. Now, as AI has become a catchall term, and AI agents — software that can perform specific tasks on behalf of users — have emerged everywhere, Gupshup has started enabling businesses to deploy agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s a lot of demand coming from enterprises. Everybody needs to build these AI agents, which work through messaging like RCS and WhatsApp or through voice. So, building out these agents, there’s huge demand, and we need to support it,” Seth said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Globally, AI agents are gaining traction, with startups building them drawing strong investor interest. Tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are also exploring how to bring more of these agents to users through their own platforms. The result: competition is heating up.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gupshup does not view the rising competition as a threat. Seth pointed to the startup’s substantial install base — which exceeds 50,000 customers across more than 100 countries — and its track record of product innovation, driven by years of experience in business messaging, strategic acquisitions, and internal R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Businesses cannot use simple foundation models off the shelf and just put them in front of customers. They need a lot of customization to be done, and that’s where Gupshup comes in. That’s what we provide,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its last round in July 2021, the startup “tripled” its revenue and grew its profitability, Sheth said. However, it is unclear whether that resulted in an increased valuation, as, he said, this latest round was not priced.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As a founder, you focus on value, and the valuation will follow,” Seth said when asked whether he still considers the startup a unicorn. “We operate ourselves like we are going to be a big company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside expanding geographically, the startup aims to utilize its fresh funding to enhance its products, which are used in industries including automotive, banking, e-commerce, fintech, media, payments, retail, and travel. Its products also include click-to-chat ads, an AI campaign copilot, agent assist, and campaign manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gupshup claims to power over 120 billion messages annually for thousands of enterprises. Looking ahead, the startup sees an IPO as its next major milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re talking to all our advisors, lawyers, bankers, accountants, and so on, to figure this out,” Seth said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has no specific timeline for its public listing, although Seth told TechCrunch that it could happen in 18–24 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gupshup is exploring whether it should list on Indian stock exchanges — a move that makes strategic sense, as the startup views India, where WhatsApp dominates, as a more favorable market. Among the reasons: it’s easier to communicate its story to local retail investors, who are more familiar with WhatsApp and understand how Gupshup’s products, including its AI agents, operate within the platform. However, since Gupshup is domiciled in the U.S., a flip to India would trigger tax liabilities, which could require additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The IPO “is the one thing that we don’t control entirely. The calendar depends as much on external factors as it does on the company,” Seth said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2080972792_585087.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Gupshup, a business messaging startup that began its journey in India over two decades ago and became a unicorn four years ago, has raised a new over $60 million round — but is keeping its new valuation under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;

Altman positions OpenAI as not just a participant, but as the essential architect of our destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding court at the Federal Reserve’s conference for large banks, Altman clearly stated how he believes AI will impact how people earn a living. He spoke of certain jobs not just being changed, but erased completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some areas, again, I think will be totally, totally gone,” he said, pointing at the customer support industry as an example. “That’s a category where I just say, you know what, when you call customer support, you’re speaking to AI, and that’s fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described this shift not as a distant forecast but as a present-day reality. To the Federal Reserve’s Michelle Bowman, he described an almost utopian interaction with an AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You call one of these things and AI answers. It’s like a super-smart, capable person,” says Altman. “There’s no phone tree, there’s no transfers. It can do everything that any customer support agent at that company could do. It does not make mistakes. It’s very quick. You call once and the thing just happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Altman’s belief that AI will cause total job losses in some careers isn’t the only story being told in the tech world. Others argue that the future isn’t about what AI will do to us, but what we choose to do with it. Manoj Chaudhary, CTO of the integration firm Jitterbit, offers a dose of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI isn’t what threatens jobs, but rather poorly planned deployment. The real danger lies in using powerful tools without purpose or human judgment,” Chaudhary warned. He sees a risk in a blind rush for technological solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Companies chasing quick efficiencies risk discarding the human insight that drives real value. As many are now realising, AI isn’t a cure-all; even the smartest systems fall short where empathy and nuance matter. Without careful, human-led oversight, the consequences of AI misuse will be hard to ignore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of Altman’s vision for AI, however, extends far beyond call centres. The transformation, he suggests, is already knocking at the door of our healthcare system. He made the claim that his company’s own creation is already a world-class physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChatGPT today, by the way, most of the time, is like a better diagnostician than most doctors in the world,” he asserted. Yet, in a moment of candour – after championing AI as the superior doctor – he confessed he wouldn’t fully trust it with his own health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet people still go to doctors, and I am not, like, maybe I’m a dinosaur here, but I really do not want to, like, entrust my medical fate to ChatGPT with no human doctor in the loop,” he admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tightrope walk between promotion and precaution is happening on a new political stage. Under the Trump administration, the conversation in Washington around AI has shifted from the caution and regulation sought under President Biden to minimise impacts like job losses, to an unrelenting focus on acceleration to outpace China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in this high-stakes environment that Altman shared his deepest fears. He spoke of sleepless nights, troubled by the thought of a hostile nation using AI as a weapon to cripple the US financial system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman also marvelled at the power of voice cloning technology but warned of how it could be used for unstoppable fraud, especially since “there are still some financial institutions that will accept voiceprints for authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI chief’s visit, his first major congressional testimony since he exploded onto the global stage in 2023, is part of a clear strategy as the firm plans to open an OpenAI office in Washington next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman came to Washington with two messages that seem to pull in opposite directions. The first is that his technology will bring about an age of incredible progress. However, the second is that AI holds the potential for immense destruction—causing total job losses and increasing national security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal, it seems, is to convince the world that only he and OpenAI can safely navigate the path between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image credit: World Economic Forum / Benedikt von Loebell under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 license.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI Action Plan should provide a roadmap of the Trump administration’s strategies, priorities, and concerns around AI — likely a technology that will come to define the 47th President’s term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The plan is effectively a replacement for the Biden AI executive order, the previous administration’s AI strategy which placed a large focus on mandating AI companies to submit safety and security reports, and trying to limit racial or otherwise discriminatory bias in frontier AI models. Trump repealed Biden’s order within days of his inauguration, arguing that its requirements could be onerous for AI companies, and may hinder American innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its first six months, the Trump Administration has broadly encouraged efforts to accelerate the development and distribution of American AI technology. Trump helped OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announce their multi-billion dollar Stargate data center project, and the President peeled back restrictions on Nvidia selling its AI chips around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks has picked a fight with technology companies over “woke” AI, claiming that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supposedly instilling left-leaning values into their AI chatbots and censoring conservative viewpoints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some are already pushing back on Trump’s AI Action plan for allegedly putting corporate interests ahead of the public. On Tuesday, a group of more than 90 organizations including labor, environmental justice, and consumer protection non-profits published an open letter called the People’s AI&amp;nbsp;Action Plan. This puts forth a series of AI policies that claim to put the interests of American citizens first, and counter what Trump is expected to announce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We can’t let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ well-being,” the group said in a statement to TechCrunch that acknowledged the energy needs of Silicon Valley’s AI data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan should advance his administration’s agenda more explicitly, but exactly how remains unclear. Trump is expected to share more details about the plan at the “Winning the AI Race” summit, an event hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum and the All In podcast, which Sacks co-hosts when he’s not serving as a government official or venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s what we know about the AI Action Plan so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accelerating-american-ai"&gt;Accelerating American AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trump’s AI strategy is expected to focus on three pillars — infrastructure, innovation, and global influence — according to a report from Time Magazine. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For infrastructure, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to overhaul permitting rules to speed up the development of AI data centers. This aims to help AI companies meet with the growing energy needs to train and serve their AI models. However, it’s widely expected that the rise of AI data centers — which suck up immense amounts of energy and water from neighboring communities — could cause energy shortages by the end of the decade unless there’s a rapid increase in energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The president’s infrastructure pillar is also expected to include a plan to modernize America’s electrical grid and add new sources of energy to power these data centers, according to Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the innovation front, Trump reportedly plans to use his AI Action Plan to revive the conversation around blocking state AI laws (even though a federal proposition on the issue overwhelmingly failed last month). This is part of an effort to reduce barriers to innovation for American AI companies, but may ultimately block lawmakers from passing meaningful safety and security standards for AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the global influence pillar, Trump is expected to put forth a strategy to advance the adoption of American AI models and chips, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Federal officials were spooked by the rise of the DeepSeek, and other Chinese AI labs such as Qwen and Moonshot AI have since become worthy competitors to OpenAI. Trump wants America’s technology to be the global standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To advance its goals, the Trump administration is also expected to sign a series of AI-related executive orders on Wednesday, according to The Washington Post. Some of these orders clear the path for faster data center buildouts, while others encourage the export of American technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-combatting-woke-ai"&gt;Combatting ‘woke’ AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the executive orders Trump is slated to sign Wednesday would crackdown on “woke” AI models, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The order requires AI companies with federal contracts — which includes OpenAI, xAI, Google, and Anthropic — to ensure their AI models have neutral and unbiased language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The crackdown on “woke” AI marks the Republican party’s latest attack on Silicon Valley’s historically left-leaning crowd. In past years, Republican investigated social media companies for allegedly altering their algorithms to censor conservative voices. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently capitulated to these allegations, and overhauled Facebook and Instagram’s content moderation to represent more voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A key question looming around this executive order is who defines whether AI models are neutral or biased, and how they determine it. Trump has long stated he’s an advocate of free speech, so an executive order setting rules around what an AI model can and can’t say may seem counterintuitive. That said, a Florida judge recently ruled that AI chatbots are not protected by the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In light of this crack down, OpenAI and other AI labs have tried to make their AI chatbots represent more viewpoints. These companies are in the awkward position to generate AI responses that please everyone, while also not spreading extremist viewpoints or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk, once Trump’s greatest financial backer whose relationship with the president has recently soured, explicitly started xAI to develop an “anti-woke” AI chatbot, Grok, and combat ChatGPT. However, xAI’s effort to create such a chatbot hasn’t gone so well. In recent weeks, xAI was forced to apologize repeatedly when its AI chatbot went on antisemitic rants and consulted Musk’s personal opinions on hot-button issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-want"&gt;What Silicon Valley and Big Tech want&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The White House announced in April it had received more than 10,000 public comments from companies, local governments, and nonprofit organizations regarding Trump’s AI Action Plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon effectively took the opportunity to submit wishlists of friendly AI policies they’d like to see the Trump administration implement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many of America’s leading AI model developers asked Trump to use his AI Action plan to guarantee that training large language models on copyrighted material would be fair use, and should therefore be allowed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Such a protection could benefit these companies significantly, as many of them are involved in active lawsuits with copyright owners from the music, film, news, and book industries. These publishers have accused AI companies of illegally training on their copyrighted works to make AI models, potentially devaluing their media in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Meta asked Trump to protect open AI models — which are freely available to download online. By releasing its Llama models openly, Meta has been able to undercut OpenAI and Google’s closed offerings. However, Anthropic has raised concerns over whether open AI models could leak powerful technology to bad actors, including China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other interest groups, including nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute, used the commenting period to ask the Trump administration to increase investment into AI research efforts outside of commercial entities. The request comes at a time when the Trump administration and DOGE have slashed funding for American universities, many of which have been powerhouses for scientific breakthroughs in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It seems unlikely that Trump’s AI action plan will feature the same safety and security reporting standards that the Biden administration sought to impose. However, polls show that most Americans want AI companies to be held to safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several state lawmakers are pushing bills that would create safety and security reporting mandates, but they may face opposition from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers should they contradict Trump’s AI Action Plan..&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1327493808.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his long-awaited AI Action Plan at a Washington D.C. event Wednesday hosted by Silicon Valley insiders — his first major address concerning artificial intelligence since he took office for the second time in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI Action Plan should provide a roadmap of the Trump administration’s strategies, priorities, and concerns around AI — likely a technology that will come to define the 47th President’s term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The plan is effectively a replacement for the Biden AI executive order, the previous administration’s AI strategy which placed a large focus on mandating AI companies to submit safety and security reports, and trying to limit racial or otherwise discriminatory bias in frontier AI models. Trump repealed Biden’s order within days of his inauguration, arguing that its requirements could be onerous for AI companies, and may hinder American innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its first six months, the Trump Administration has broadly encouraged efforts to accelerate the development and distribution of American AI technology. Trump helped OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announce their multi-billion dollar Stargate data center project, and the President peeled back restrictions on Nvidia selling its AI chips around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks has picked a fight with technology companies over “woke” AI, claiming that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supposedly instilling left-leaning values into their AI chatbots and censoring conservative viewpoints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some are already pushing back on Trump’s AI Action plan for allegedly putting corporate interests ahead of the public. On Tuesday, a group of more than 90 organizations including labor, environmental justice, and consumer protection non-profits published an open letter called the People’s AI&amp;nbsp;Action Plan. This puts forth a series of AI policies that claim to put the interests of American citizens first, and counter what Trump is expected to announce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We can’t let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ well-being,” the group said in a statement to TechCrunch that acknowledged the energy needs of Silicon Valley’s AI data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan should advance his administration’s agenda more explicitly, but exactly how remains unclear. Trump is expected to share more details about the plan at the “Winning the AI Race” summit, an event hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum and the All In podcast, which Sacks co-hosts when he’s not serving as a government official or venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s what we know about the AI Action Plan so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accelerating-american-ai"&gt;Accelerating American AI&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Thwaites glacier is a fortress larger than Florida, a wall of ice that reaches nearly 4,000 feet above the bedrock of West Antarctica, guarding the low-lying ice sheet behind it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a strong, warm ocean current is weakening its foundations and accelerating its slide into the sea. Scientists fear the waters could topple the walls in the coming decades, kick-starting a runaway process that would crack up the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, marking the start of a global climate disaster. As a result, they are eager to understand just how likely such a collapse is, when it could happen, and if we have the power to stop it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at MIT and Dartmouth College founded the Arête Glacier Initiative last year in the hope of providing clearer answers to these questions.

Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have launched ‘agentic’ products that can do things for you like making bookings, filling in forms, and collaborating with you on coding projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a LinkedIn Live event yesterday our editor-in-chief Mat Honan, senior editor for AI Will Douglas Heaven, and senior AI reporter Grace Huckins discussed what’s exciting about agents and where the technology will go next, but also its limitations, and the risks that currently come with adopting it. Check out what they had to say!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Thwaites glacier is a fortress larger than Florida, a wall of ice that reaches nearly 4,000 feet above the bedrock of West Antarctica, guarding the low-lying ice sheet behind it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a strong, warm ocean current is weakening its foundations and accelerating its slide into the sea. Scientists fear the waters could topple the walls in the coming decades, kick-starting a runaway process that would crack up the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, marking the start of a global climate disaster. As a result, they are eager to understand just how likely such a collapse is, when it could happen, and if we have the power to stop it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at MIT and Dartmouth College founded the Arête Glacier Initiative last year in the hope of providing clearer answers to these questions.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the chatbot keeps no logs of your conversations, has end-to-end encryption for storing chats, and offers a ghost mode for conversations that disappear as soon as you close the window.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Available via a web client, as well as Android and iOS apps, Lumo doesn’t require you to have an account to use the chatbot and ask questions. You can upload files to have the chatbot answer questions about them, and if you have a Proton Drive account, you can connect it with Lumo to access files stored in the cloud. While the chatbot has access to the web, it might not find you the latest results if you use it to search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030408" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-5.43.34PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Screenshot by TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Proton seems intent on making it clear that its focus is on privacy. The company says Lumo is based on open-source models, and it will only depend on them for research and development going forward without utilizing user data to train its models. It also said Lumo relies on zero-access encryption, an encryption method that other Proton products also use, to let users store their conversation history, which can be decrypted on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Throughout its blog post about Lumo, Proton emphasized its European base, saying it gives the company a leg up over AI companies based in the U.S. and China when it comes to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030409" height="206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-26_863148c074.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image credits: Proton.me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Lumo is based upon open-source language models and operates from Proton’s European datacenters. This gives you much greater transparency into the way Lumo works than any other major AI assistant. Unlike Apple Intelligence and others, Lumo is not a partnership with OpenAI or other American or Chinese AI companies, and your queries are never sent to any third parties,” Proton said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is not Proton’s first foray into the fast-developing AI tools space: Last year, it rolled out an AI-powered writing assistant for its Mail product that also runs on the user’s device.&lt;/p&gt;
