The company’s hardware chief, Johny Srouji, made that clear during a speech last month in Belgium. He said Apple is exploring AI as a way to save time and reduce complexity in chip design, especially as chips grow more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generative AI techniques have a high potential in getting more design work in less time, and it can be a huge productivity boost,” Srouji said. He was speaking while receiving an award from Imec, a semiconductor research group that works with major chipmakers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned how much Apple depends on third-party software from electronic design automation (EDA) companies. The tools are key to developing the company’s chips. Synopsys and Cadence, two of the biggest EDA firms, are both working to add more AI into their design tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From the A4 to Vision Pro: A design timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Srouji’s remarks offered a rare glimpse into Apple’s internal process. He walked through Apple’s journey, starting with the A4 chip in the iPhone 4, launched in 2010. Since then, Apple has built a range of custom chips, including those used in the iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. The company also developed the chips that run the Vision Pro headset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that while hardware is important, the real challenge lies in design. Over time, chip design has become more complex and now requires tight coordination between hardware and software. Srouji said AI has the potential to make that coordination faster and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Apple is working with Broadcom on server chips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Apple began a quiet project with chip supplier Broadcom to develop its first AI server chip. The processor, known internally as “Baltra,” is said to be part of Apple’s larger plan to support more AI services on the back end. That includes features tied to Apple Intelligence, the company’s new suite of AI tools for iPhones, iPads, and Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baltra is expected to power Apple’s private cloud infrastructure. Unlike devices that run AI locally, this chip will sit in servers, likely inside Apple’s own data centres. It would help handle heavier AI workloads that are too much for on-device chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On-device vs. cloud: Apple’s AI infrastructure split&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is trying to balance user privacy with the need for more powerful AI features. Some of its AI tools will run directly on devices. Others will use server-based chips like Baltra. The setup is part of what Apple calls “Private Cloud Compute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says users won’t need to sign in, and data will be kept anonymous. But the approach depends on having a solid foundation of hardware – both in devices and in the cloud. That’s where chips like Baltra come in. Building its own server chips would give Apple more control over performance, security, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No backup plan: A pattern in Apple’s hardware strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Srouji said Apple is used to taking big hardware risks. When the company moved its Mac lineup from Intel to Apple Silicon in 2020, it didn’t prepare a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving the Mac to Apple Silicon was a huge bet for us. There was no backup plan, no split-the-lineup plan, so we went all in, including a monumental software effort,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mindset now seems to apply to Apple’s AI chips. Srouji said the company is willing to go all in again, trusting that AI tools can make the chip design process faster and more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;EDA firms like Synopsys and Cadence shape the roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Apple designs its own chips, it depends heavily on tools built by other companies. Srouji mentioned how important EDA vendors are to Apple’s chip efforts. Cadence and Synopsys are both updating their software to include more AI features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsys recently introduced a product called AgentEngineer. It uses AI agents to help chip designers automate repetitive tasks and manage complex workflows. The idea is to let human engineers focus on higher-level decisions. The changes could make it easier for companies like Apple to speed up chip development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadence is also expanding its AI offerings. Both firms are in a race to meet the needs of tech companies that want faster and cheaper ways to design chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What comes next: Talent, testing, and production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Apple adds more AI into its chip design, it will need to bring in new kinds of talent. That includes engineers who can work with AI tools, as well as people who understand both hardware and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, chips like Baltra still need to be tested and manufactured. Apple will likely continue to rely on partners like TSMC for chip production. But the design work is moving more in-house, and AI is playing a bigger role in that shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Apple integrates these AI-designed chips into products and services remains to be seen. What’s clear is that the company is trying to tighten its control over the full stack – hardware, software, and now the infrastructure that powers AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sumudu-mohottige-bIgpii04UIg-unsplash-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is beginning to use generative artificial intelligence to help design the chips that power its devices.

Synopsys and Cadence, two of the biggest EDA firms, are both working to add more AI into their design tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From the A4 to Vision Pro: A design timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Srouji’s remarks offered a rare glimpse into Apple’s internal process. He walked through Apple’s journey, starting with the A4 chip in the iPhone 4, launched in 2010. Since then, Apple has built a range of custom chips, including those used in the iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. The company also developed the chips that run the Vision Pro headset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that while hardware is important, the real challenge lies in design. Over time, chip design has become more complex and now requires tight coordination between hardware and software. Srouji said AI has the potential to make that coordination faster and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Apple is working with Broadcom on server chips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Apple began a quiet project with chip supplier Broadcom to develop its first AI server chip. The processor, known internally as “Baltra,” is said to be part of Apple’s larger plan to support more AI services on the back end. That includes features tied to Apple Intelligence, the company’s new suite of AI tools for iPhones, iPads, and Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baltra is expected to power Apple’s private cloud infrastructure. Unlike devices that run AI locally, this chip will sit in servers, likely inside Apple’s own data centres. It would help handle heavier AI workloads that are too much for on-device chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On-device vs. cloud: Apple’s AI infrastructure split&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is trying to balance user privacy with the need for more powerful AI features. Some of its AI tools will run directly on devices. Others will use server-based chips like Baltra. The setup is part of what Apple calls “Private Cloud Compute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says users won’t need to sign in, and data will be kept anonymous. But the approach depends on having a solid foundation of hardware – both in devices and in the cloud. That’s where chips like Baltra come in. Building its own server chips would give Apple more control over performance, security, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No backup plan: A pattern in Apple’s hardware strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Srouji said Apple is used to taking big hardware risks. When the company moved its Mac lineup from Intel to Apple Silicon in 2020, it didn’t prepare a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving the Mac to Apple Silicon was a huge bet for us. There was no backup plan, no split-the-lineup plan, so we went all in, including a monumental software effort,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mindset now seems to apply to Apple’s AI chips. Srouji said the company is willing to go all in again, trusting that AI tools can make the chip design process faster and more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;EDA firms like Synopsys and Cadence shape the roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Apple designs its own chips, it depends heavily on tools built by other companies. Srouji mentioned how important EDA vendors are to Apple’s chip efforts. Cadence and Synopsys are both updating their software to include more AI features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsys recently introduced a product called AgentEngineer. It uses AI agents to help chip designers automate repetitive tasks and manage complex workflows. The idea is to let human engineers focus on higher-level decisions. The changes could make it easier for companies like Apple to speed up chip development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadence is also expanding its AI offerings. Both firms are in a race to meet the needs of tech companies that want faster and cheaper ways to design chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What comes next: Talent, testing, and production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Apple adds more AI into its chip design, it will need to bring in new kinds of talent. That includes engineers who can work with AI tools, as well as people who understand both hardware and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, chips like Baltra still need to be tested and manufactured. Apple will likely continue to rely on partners like TSMC for chip production. But the design work is moving more in-house, and AI is playing a bigger role in that shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Apple integrates these AI-designed chips into products and services remains to be seen. What’s clear is that the company is trying to tighten its control over the full stack – hardware, software, and now the infrastructure that powers AI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/apple-ai-chip-design-automation/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:59:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Inside the US power struggle over coal (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/19/1119027/us-coal-power-struggle/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25147647719600.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coal power is on life support in the US. It used to carry the grid with cheap electricity, but now plants are closing left and right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of potential reasons to let coal continue its journey to the grave. Carbon emissions from coal plants are a major contributor to climate change. And those facilities are also often linked with health problems in nearby communities, as reporter Alex Kaufman explored in a new feature story on Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power plant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration wants to keep coal power alive, and the US Department of Energy recently ordered some plants to stay open past their scheduled closures. Here’s why there’s a power struggle over coal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coal used to be king in the US, but the country has dramatically reduced its dependence on the fuel over the past two decades. It accounted for about 20% of the electricity generated in 2024, down from roughly half in 2000.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;While the demise of coal has been great for US emissions, the real driver is economics. Coal used to be the cheapest form of electricity generation around, but the fracking boom handed that crown to natural gas over a decade ago. And now, even cheaper wind and solar power is coming online in droves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Economics was a major factor in the planned retirement of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, which was set to close at the end of May, Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then, on May 23, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright released an emergency order that requires the plant to remain open. Wright’s order mandates 90 more days of operation, and the order can be extended past that, too. It states that the goal is to minimize the risk of blackouts and address grid security issues before the start of summer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The DOE’s authority to require power plants to stay open is something that’s typically used in emergencies like hurricanes, rather than in response to something as routine as … seasons changing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that there’s growing concern in the US about meeting demand for electricity, which is rising for the first time after being basically flat for decades. (The recent rise is in large part due to massive data centers, like those needed to run AI. Have I mentioned we have a great package on AI and energy?)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we are indeed heading toward summer, which is when the grid is stretched to its limits. In the New York area, the forecast high is nearly 100 °F (38 °C) for several days next week—I’ll certainly have my air conditioner on, and I’m sure I’ll soon be getting texts asking me to limit electricity use during times of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is keeping old coal plants open the answer to a stressed grid?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It might not be the most economical way forward. In fact, in almost every case today, it’s actually cheaper to build &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; renewables capacity than to keep &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; coal plants running in the US, according to a 2023 report from Energy Innovation, an energy think tank. And coal is only getting more expensive—in an updated analysis, Energy Innovation found that three-quarters of coal plants saw costs rising faster than inflation between 2021 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Granted, solar and wind aren’t always available, while coal plants can be fired up on demand. And getting new projects built and connected to the grid will take time (right now, there’s a huge backlog of renewable projects waiting in the interconnection queue). But some experts say we actually don’t need new generation that urgently anyway, if big electricity users can be flexible with their demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we’re already seeing batteries come to the rescue on the grid at times of stress. Between May 2024 and April 2025, US battery storage capacity increased by about 40%. When Texas faced high temperatures last month, batteries did a lot to help the state make it through without blackouts, as this Bloomberg story points out. Costs are falling, too; prices are about 19% lower in 2024 than they were in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even as the Trump administration is raising concerns about grid reliability, it’s moved to gut programs designed to get more electricity generation and storage online, like the tax credits that support wind, solar, and battery production and installation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Lincoln Electric System, the local electric utility, has approximately 150,000 customers. By lunchtime, nearly 10% of them were without power. Ice was accumulating on the lines, causing them to slap together and circuits to lock. Sustained high winds and strong gusts—including one recorded at the Lincoln airport at 74 mph—snapped an entire line of poles across an empty field on the northern edge of the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Emeka Anyanwu kept the outage map open on his screen, refreshing it every 10 minutes or so while the 18 crews out in the field—some 75 to 80 line workers in total&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;struggled to shrink the orange circles that stood for thousands of customers in the dark. This was already Anyanwu’s second major storm since he’d become CEO of Lincoln Electric, in January of 2024. Warm and dry in his corner office, he fretted over what his colleagues were facing. Anyanwu spent the first part of his career at Kansas City Power &amp;amp; Light (now called Evergy), designing distribution systems, supervising crews, and participating in storm response. “Part of my DNA as a utility person is storm response,” he says. In weather like this “there’s a physical toll of trying to resist the wind and maneuver your body,” he adds. “You’re working slower. There’s just stuff that can’t get done. You’re basically being sandblasted.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lincoln Electric is headquartered in a gleaming new building named after Anyanwu’s predecessor, Kevin Wailes. Its cavernous garage, like an airplane hangar, is designed so that vehicles never need to reverse. As crews returned for a break and a dry change of clothes, their faces burned red and raw from the sleet and wind, their truck bumpers dripped ice onto the concrete floor. In a darkened control room, supervisors collected damage assessments, phoned or radioed in by the crews. The division heads above them huddled in a small conference room across the hall—their own outage map filling a large screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118684" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF3750-mag.jpg?w=1937" width="1937" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Emeka Anyanwu is CEO of Lincoln Electric System.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyanwu did his best to stay out of the way. “I sit on the storm calls, and I’ll have an idea or a thought, and I try not to be in the middle of things,” he says. “I’m not in their hair. I didn’t go downstairs until the very end of the day, as I was leaving the building—because I just don’t want to be looming. And I think, quite frankly, our folks do an excellent job. They don’t need me.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a moment of disruption, Anyanwu chooses collaboration over control. His attitude is not that “he alone can fix it,” but that his team knows the assignment and is ready for the task. Yet a spring blizzard like this is the least of Anyanwu’s problems. It is a predictable disruption, albeit one of a type that seems to occur with greater frequency. What will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the industry, they call it the “trilemma”: the seemingly intractable problem of balancing reliability, affordability, and sustainability. Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind, in all their vicissitudes.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Yet over the last year, the trilemma has turned out to be table stakes. Additional layers of pressure have been building—including powerful new technical and political considerations that would seem to guarantee disruption. The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by unstoppable forces and immovable objects—an interlocking series of factors so oppositional that Anyanwu’s clear-eyed approach to the trials ahead makes Lincoln Electric an effective lens through which to examine the grid of the near future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A worsening storm&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The urgent technical challenge for utilities is the rise in electricity demand—the result, in part, of AI. In the living memory of the industry, every organic increase in load from population growth has been quietly matched by a decrease in load thanks to efficiency (primarily from LED lighting and improvements in appliances). No longer. Demand from new data centers, factories, and the electrification of cars, kitchens, and home heaters has broken that pattern. Annual load growth that had been less than 1% since 2000 is now projected to exceed 3%. In 2022, the grid was expected to add 23 gigawatts of new capacity over the next five years; now it is expected to add 128 gigawatts.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The political challenge is one the world knows well: Donald Trump, and his appetite for upheaval. Significant Biden-era legislation drove the adoption of renewable energy across dozens of sectors. Broad tax incentives invigorated cleantech manufacturing and renewable development, government policies rolled out the red carpet for wind and solar on federal lands, and funding became available for next-generation energy tech including storage, nuclear, and geothermal. The Trump administration’s swerve would appear absolute, at least in climate terms. The government is slowing (if not stopping) the permitting of offshore and onshore wind, while encouraging development of coal and other fossil fuels with executive orders (though they will surely face legal challenges). Its declaration of an “energy emergency” could radically disrupt the electric grid’s complex regulatory regime—throwing a monkey wrench into the rules by which utilities play. Trump’s blustery rhetoric on its own emboldens some communities to fight harder against new wind and solar projects, raising costs and uncertainty for developers—perhaps past the point of viability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet the momentum of the energy transition remains substantial, if not unstoppable. The US Energy Information Administration’s published expectations for 2025, released in February, include 63 gigawatts of new utility-scale generation—93% of which will be solar, wind, or storage. In Texas, the interconnection queue (a leading indicator of what will be built) is about 92% solar, wind, and storage. What happens next is somehow both obvious and impossible to predict. The situation amounts to a deranged swirl of macro dynamics, a dilemma inside the trilemma, caught in a political hurricane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A microcosm&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is a CEO to do? Anyanwu got the LES job in part by squaring off against the technical issues while parrying the political ones. He grew up professionally in “T&amp;amp;D,” transmission and distribution, the bread and butter of the grid. Between his time in Kansas City and Lincoln, he led Seattle City Light’s innovation efforts, working on the problems of electrification, energy markets, resource planning strategy, cybersecurity, and grid modernization.&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118687" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF3925.jpg?w=1905" width="1905" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;LES’s indoor training facility accommodates a 50-foot utility pole and dirt-floor instruction area, for line workers to practice repairs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;His charisma takes a notably different form from the visionary salesmanship of the startup CEO. Anyanwu exudes responsibility and stewardship—key qualities in the utility industry. A “third culture kid,” he was born in Ames, Iowa, where his Nigerian parents had come to study agriculture and early childhood education. He returned with them to Nigeria for most of his childhood before returning himself to Iowa State University. He is 45 years old and six feet two inches tall, and he has three children under 10. At LES’s open board meetings, in podcast interviews, and even when receiving an industry award, Anyanwu has always insisted that credit and commendation are rightly shared by everyone on the team. He builds consensus with praise and acknowledgment. After the blizzard, he thanked the Lincoln community for “the grace and patience they always show.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nebraska is the only 100% “public power state,” with utilities owned and managed entirely by the state’s own communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trilemma won’t be easy for any utility, yet LES is both special and typical. It’s big enough to matter, but small enough to manage. (Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric, to take one example, has about 37 times as many customers.) It is a partial owner in three large coal plants—the most recent of which opened in 2007—and has contracts for 302 megawatts of wind power. It even has a gargantuan new data center in its service area; later this year, Google expects to open a campus on some 580 acres abutting Interstate 80, 10 minutes from downtown. From a technical standpoint, Anyanwu leads an organization whose situation is emblematic of the challenges and opportunities utilities face today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equally interesting is what Lincoln Electric is not: a for-profit utility. Two-thirds of Americans get their electricity from “investor-­owned utilities,” while the remaining third are served by either publicly owned nonprofits like LES or privately owned nonprofit cooperatives. But Nebraska is the only 100% “public power state,” with utilities owned and managed entirely by the state’s own communities. They are governed by local boards and focused fully on the needs—and aspirations—of their customers. “LES is public power and is explicitly serving the public interest,” says Lucas Sabalka, a local technology executive who serves as the unpaid chairman of the board. “LES tries very, very hard to communicate that public interest and to seek public input, and to make sure that the public feels like they’re included in that process.” Civic duty sits at the core.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a split incentive,” Anyanwu says. “We’re not going to do something just to gobble up as many rate-based assets as we can earn on. That’s not what we do—it’s not what we exist to do.” He adds, “Our role as a utility is stewardship. We are the diligent and vigilant agents of our community.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A political puzzle&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, over a series of open meetings that sometimes drew 200 people, the public encouraged the LES board to adopt a noteworthy resolution: Lincoln Electric’s generation portfolio would reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. It wasn’t alone; Nebraska’s other two largest utilities, the Omaha Public Power District and the Nebraska Public Power District, adopted similar nonbinding decarbonization goals.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These goals build on a long transition toward cleaner energy. Over the last decade, Nebraska’s energy sector has been transformed by wind power, which in 2023 provided 30% of its net generation. That’s been an economic boon for a state that is notably oil-poor compared with its neighbors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at the same time, the tall turbines have become a cultural lightning rod—both for their appearance and for the way they displace farmland (much of which, ironically, was directed toward corn for production of ethanol fuel). That dynamic has intensified since Trump’s second election, with both solar and wind projects around the state facing heightened community opposition.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the unanimous approval by Lancaster County commissioners of a 304-megawatt solar plant outside Lincoln, one of the largest in the state, local opponents appealed. The project’s developer, the Florida-based behemoth NextEra Energy Resources, made news in March when its CEO both praised the Trump administration’s policy and insisted that solar and storage remained the fastest path to increasing the energy supply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118688" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF4222.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lincoln Electric is headquartered in a gleaming new building named after Anyanwu’s predecessor, Kevin Wailes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nebraska is, after all, a red state, where only an estimated 66% of adults think global warming is happening, according to a survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. President Trump won almost 60% of the vote statewide, though only 47% of the vote in Lancaster County—a purple dot in a sea of red.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are no simple answers,” Anyanwu says, with characteristic measure. “In our industry there’s a lot of people trying to win an ideological debate, and they insist on that debate being binary. And I think it should be pretty clear to most of us—if we’re being intellectually honest about this—that there isn’t a binary answer to anything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The new technical frontier&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What there are, are questions. The most intractable of them—how to add capacity without raising costs or carbon emissions—came to a head for LES starting in April 2024. Like almost all utilities in the US, LES relies on an independent RTO, or regional transmission organization, to ensure reliability by balancing supply and demand and to run an electricity market (among other roles). The principle is that when the utilities on the grid pool both their load and their generation, everyone benefits—in terms of both reliability and economic efficiency. “Think of the market like a potluck,” Anyanwu says. “Everyone is supposed to bring enough food to feed their own family—but the compact is not that their family eats the food.” Each utility must come to the market with enough capacity to serve its peak loads, even as the electrons are all pooled together in a feast that can feed many. (The bigger the grid, the more easily it absorbs small fluctuations or failures.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But today, everyone is hungrier. And the oven doesn’t always work. In an era when the only real variable was whether power plants were switched on or off, determining capacity was relatively straightforward: A 164-megawatt gas or coal plant could, with reasonable reliability, be expected to produce 164 megawatts of power. Wind and solar break that model, even though they run without fuel costs (or carbon emissions). “Resource adequacy,” as the industry calls it, is a wildly complex game of averages and expectations, which are calculated around the seasonal peaks when a utility has the highest load. On those record-breaking days, keeping the lights on requires every power plant to show up and turn on. But solar and wind don’t work that way. The summer peak could be a day when it’s cloudy and calm; the winter peak will definitely be a day when the sun sets early. Coal and gas plants are not without their own reliability challenges. They frequently go offline for maintenance. And—especially in winter—the system of underground pipelines that supply gas is at risk of freezing and cannot always keep up with the stacked demand from home heating customers and big power plants.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politics had suddenly become beside the point; the new goal was to keep the lights—and the AI data centers—on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Faced with a rapidly changing mix of generation resources, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), the RTO responsible for a big swath of the country including Nebraska, decided that prudence should reign. In August 2024, SPP changed its “accreditations”—the expectation for how much electricity each power plant, of every type, could be counted on to contribute on those peak days. Everything would be graded on a curve. If your gas plant had a tendency to break, it would be worth less. If you had a ton of wind, it would count more for the winter peak (when it’s windier) than for the summer. If you had solar, it would count more in summer (when the days are longer and brighter) than in winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new rules meant LES needed to come to the potluck with more capacity—calculated with a particular formula of SPP’s devising. It was as if a pound of hamburgers was decreed to feed more people than a pound of tofu. Clean power and environmental advocacy groups jeered the changes, because they so obviously favored fossil-fuel generation while penalizing wind and solar. (Whether this was the result of industry lobbying, embedded ideology, or an immature technical understanding was not clear.) But resource adequacy is difficult to argue with. No one will risk a brownout.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the terms of the trilemma, this amounted to the stick of reliability beating the horse of affordability, while sustainability stood by and waited for its turn. Politics had suddenly become beside the point; the new goal was to keep the lights—and the AI data centers—on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Navigating a way forward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what to do? LES can lobby against SPP’s rules, but it must follow them. The community can want what it wants, but the lights must stay on. Hard choices are coming. “We’re not going to go out and spend money we shouldn’t or make financially imprudent decisions because we’re chasing a goal,” Anyanwu says of the resolution to reach net zero by 2040. “We’re not going to compromise reliability to do any of that. But within the bounds of those realities, the community does get to make a choice and say, ‘Hey, this is important to us. It matters to us that we do these things.’” As part of a strategic planning process, LES has begun a broad range of surveys and community meetings. Among other questions, respondents are asked to rank reliability, affordability, and sustainability “in order of importance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118689" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3598-2048x1190-1.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lincoln Electric commissioned Nebraska’s first wind turbines in the late ’90s. They were decommissioned in July 2024.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;What becomes visible is the role of utilities as stewards—of their infrastructure, but also of their communities. Amid the emphasis on innovative technologies, on development of renewables, on the race to power data centers, it is local utilities that carry the freight of the energy transition. While this is often obscured by the way they are beholden to their quarterly stock price, weighed down by wildfire risk, or operated as regional behemoths that seem to exist as supra-political entities, a place like Lincoln Electric reveals both the possibilities and the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The community gets to dream a little bit, right?” says Anyanwu. Yet “we as the technical Debbie Downers have to come and be like, ‘Well, okay, here’s what you want, and here’s what we can actually do.’ And we’re tempering that dream.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“But you don’t necessarily want a community that just won’t dream at all, that doesn’t have any expectations and doesn’t have any aspirations,” he adds. For Anyanwu, that’s the way through: “I’m willing to help us as an organization dream a little bit—be aspirational, be ambitious, be bold. But at my core and in my heart, I’m a utility operations person.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Blum is the author of &lt;/em&gt;Tubes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Weather Machine&lt;em&gt;.

Lincoln Electric System, the local electric utility, has approximately 150,000 customers. By lunchtime, nearly 10% of them were without power. Ice was accumulating on the lines, causing them to slap together and circuits to lock. Sustained high winds and strong gusts—including one recorded at the Lincoln airport at 74 mph—snapped an entire line of poles across an empty field on the northern edge of the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Emeka Anyanwu kept the outage map open on his screen, refreshing it every 10 minutes or so while the 18 crews out in the field—some 75 to 80 line workers in total&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;struggled to shrink the orange circles that stood for thousands of customers in the dark. This was already Anyanwu’s second major storm since he’d become CEO of Lincoln Electric, in January of 2024. Warm and dry in his corner office, he fretted over what his colleagues were facing. Anyanwu spent the first part of his career at Kansas City Power &amp;amp; Light (now called Evergy), designing distribution systems, supervising crews, and participating in storm response. “Part of my DNA as a utility person is storm response,” he says. In weather like this “there’s a physical toll of trying to resist the wind and maneuver your body,” he adds. “You’re working slower. There’s just stuff that can’t get done. You’re basically being sandblasted.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lincoln Electric is headquartered in a gleaming new building named after Anyanwu’s predecessor, Kevin Wailes. Its cavernous garage, like an airplane hangar, is designed so that vehicles never need to reverse. As crews returned for a break and a dry change of clothes, their faces burned red and raw from the sleet and wind, their truck bumpers dripped ice onto the concrete floor. In a darkened control room, supervisors collected damage assessments, phoned or radioed in by the crews. The division heads above them huddled in a small conference room across the hall—their own outage map filling a large screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118684" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF3750-mag.jpg?w=1937" width="1937" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Emeka Anyanwu is CEO of Lincoln Electric System.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyanwu did his best to stay out of the way. “I sit on the storm calls, and I’ll have an idea or a thought, and I try not to be in the middle of things,” he says. “I’m not in their hair. I didn’t go downstairs until the very end of the day, as I was leaving the building—because I just don’t want to be looming. And I think, quite frankly, our folks do an excellent job. They don’t need me.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a moment of disruption, Anyanwu chooses collaboration over control. His attitude is not that “he alone can fix it,” but that his team knows the assignment and is ready for the task. Yet a spring blizzard like this is the least of Anyanwu’s problems. It is a predictable disruption, albeit one of a type that seems to occur with greater frequency. What will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the industry, they call it the “trilemma”: the seemingly intractable problem of balancing reliability, affordability, and sustainability. Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind, in all their vicissitudes.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Yet over the last year, the trilemma has turned out to be table stakes. Additional layers of pressure have been building—including powerful new technical and political considerations that would seem to guarantee disruption. The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by unstoppable forces and immovable objects—an interlocking series of factors so oppositional that Anyanwu’s clear-eyed approach to the trials ahead makes Lincoln Electric an effective lens through which to examine the grid of the near future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A worsening storm&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The urgent technical challenge for utilities is the rise in electricity demand—the result, in part, of AI. In the living memory of the industry, every organic increase in load from population growth has been quietly matched by a decrease in load thanks to efficiency (primarily from LED lighting and improvements in appliances). No longer. Demand from new data centers, factories, and the electrification of cars, kitchens, and home heaters has broken that pattern. Annual load growth that had been less than 1% since 2000 is now projected to exceed 3%. In 2022, the grid was expected to add 23 gigawatts of new capacity over the next five years; now it is expected to add 128 gigawatts.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The political challenge is one the world knows well: Donald Trump, and his appetite for upheaval. Significant Biden-era legislation drove the adoption of renewable energy across dozens of sectors. Broad tax incentives invigorated cleantech manufacturing and renewable development, government policies rolled out the red carpet for wind and solar on federal lands, and funding became available for next-generation energy tech including storage, nuclear, and geothermal. The Trump administration’s swerve would appear absolute, at least in climate terms. The government is slowing (if not stopping) the permitting of offshore and onshore wind, while encouraging development of coal and other fossil fuels with executive orders (though they will surely face legal challenges). Its declaration of an “energy emergency” could radically disrupt the electric grid’s complex regulatory regime—throwing a monkey wrench into the rules by which utilities play. Trump’s blustery rhetoric on its own emboldens some communities to fight harder against new wind and solar projects, raising costs and uncertainty for developers—perhaps past the point of viability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet the momentum of the energy transition remains substantial, if not unstoppable. The US Energy Information Administration’s published expectations for 2025, released in February, include 63 gigawatts of new utility-scale generation—93% of which will be solar, wind, or storage. In Texas, the interconnection queue (a leading indicator of what will be built) is about 92% solar, wind, and storage. What happens next is somehow both obvious and impossible to predict. The situation amounts to a deranged swirl of macro dynamics, a dilemma inside the trilemma, caught in a political hurricane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A microcosm&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is a CEO to do? Anyanwu got the LES job in part by squaring off against the technical issues while parrying the political ones. He grew up professionally in “T&amp;amp;D,” transmission and distribution, the bread and butter of the grid. Between his time in Kansas City and Lincoln, he led Seattle City Light’s innovation efforts, working on the problems of electrification, energy markets, resource planning strategy, cybersecurity, and grid modernization.&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118687" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF3925.jpg?w=1905" width="1905" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;LES’s indoor training facility accommodates a 50-foot utility pole and dirt-floor instruction area, for line workers to practice repairs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;His charisma takes a notably different form from the visionary salesmanship of the startup CEO. Anyanwu exudes responsibility and stewardship—key qualities in the utility industry. A “third culture kid,” he was born in Ames, Iowa, where his Nigerian parents had come to study agriculture and early childhood education. He returned with them to Nigeria for most of his childhood before returning himself to Iowa State University. He is 45 years old and six feet two inches tall, and he has three children under 10. At LES’s open board meetings, in podcast interviews, and even when receiving an industry award, Anyanwu has always insisted that credit and commendation are rightly shared by everyone on the team. He builds consensus with praise and acknowledgment. After the blizzard, he thanked the Lincoln community for “the grace and patience they always show.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nebraska is the only 100% “public power state,” with utilities owned and managed entirely by the state’s own communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The trilemma won’t be easy for any utility, yet LES is both special and typical.

The project’s developer, the Florida-based behemoth NextEra Energy Resources, made news in March when its CEO both praised the Trump administration’s policy and insisted that solar and storage remained the fastest path to increasing the energy supply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118688" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSF4222.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lincoln Electric is headquartered in a gleaming new building named after Anyanwu’s predecessor, Kevin Wailes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nebraska is, after all, a red state, where only an estimated 66% of adults think global warming is happening, according to a survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. President Trump won almost 60% of the vote statewide, though only 47% of the vote in Lancaster County—a purple dot in a sea of red.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are no simple answers,” Anyanwu says, with characteristic measure. “In our industry there’s a lot of people trying to win an ideological debate, and they insist on that debate being binary. And I think it should be pretty clear to most of us—if we’re being intellectually honest about this—that there isn’t a binary answer to anything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The new technical frontier&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What there are, are questions. The most intractable of them—how to add capacity without raising costs or carbon emissions—came to a head for LES starting in April 2024. Like almost all utilities in the US, LES relies on an independent RTO, or regional transmission organization, to ensure reliability by balancing supply and demand and to run an electricity market (among other roles). The principle is that when the utilities on the grid pool both their load and their generation, everyone benefits—in terms of both reliability and economic efficiency. “Think of the market like a potluck,” Anyanwu says. “Everyone is supposed to bring enough food to feed their own family—but the compact is not that their family eats the food.” Each utility must come to the market with enough capacity to serve its peak loads, even as the electrons are all pooled together in a feast that can feed many. (The bigger the grid, the more easily it absorbs small fluctuations or failures.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But today, everyone is hungrier. And the oven doesn’t always work. In an era when the only real variable was whether power plants were switched on or off, determining capacity was relatively straightforward: A 164-megawatt gas or coal plant could, with reasonable reliability, be expected to produce 164 megawatts of power. Wind and solar break that model, even though they run without fuel costs (or carbon emissions). “Resource adequacy,” as the industry calls it, is a wildly complex game of averages and expectations, which are calculated around the seasonal peaks when a utility has the highest load. On those record-breaking days, keeping the lights on requires every power plant to show up and turn on. But solar and wind don’t work that way. The summer peak could be a day when it’s cloudy and calm; the winter peak will definitely be a day when the sun sets early. Coal and gas plants are not without their own reliability challenges. They frequently go offline for maintenance. And—especially in winter—the system of underground pipelines that supply gas is at risk of freezing and cannot always keep up with the stacked demand from home heating customers and big power plants.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politics had suddenly become beside the point; the new goal was to keep the lights—and the AI data centers—on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Faced with a rapidly changing mix of generation resources, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), the RTO responsible for a big swath of the country including Nebraska, decided that prudence should reign. In August 2024, SPP changed its “accreditations”—the expectation for how much electricity each power plant, of every type, could be counted on to contribute on those peak days. Everything would be graded on a curve. If your gas plant had a tendency to break, it would be worth less. If you had a ton of wind, it would count more for the winter peak (when it’s windier) than for the summer. If you had solar, it would count more in summer (when the days are longer and brighter) than in winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new rules meant LES needed to come to the potluck with more capacity—calculated with a particular formula of SPP’s devising. It was as if a pound of hamburgers was decreed to feed more people than a pound of tofu. Clean power and environmental advocacy groups jeered the changes, because they so obviously favored fossil-fuel generation while penalizing wind and solar. (Whether this was the result of industry lobbying, embedded ideology, or an immature technical understanding was not clear.) But resource adequacy is difficult to argue with. No one will risk a brownout.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the terms of the trilemma, this amounted to the stick of reliability beating the horse of affordability, while sustainability stood by and waited for its turn. Politics had suddenly become beside the point; the new goal was to keep the lights—and the AI data centers—on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Navigating a way forward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what to do? LES can lobby against SPP’s rules, but it must follow them. The community can want what it wants, but the lights must stay on. Hard choices are coming. “We’re not going to go out and spend money we shouldn’t or make financially imprudent decisions because we’re chasing a goal,” Anyanwu says of the resolution to reach net zero by 2040. “We’re not going to compromise reliability to do any of that. But within the bounds of those realities, the community does get to make a choice and say, ‘Hey, this is important to us. It matters to us that we do these things.’” As part of a strategic planning process, LES has begun a broad range of surveys and community meetings. Among other questions, respondents are asked to rank reliability, affordability, and sustainability “in order of importance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118689" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3598-2048x1190-1.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lincoln Electric commissioned Nebraska’s first wind turbines in the late ’90s. They were decommissioned in July 2024.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;TERRY RATZLAFF&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;What becomes visible is the role of utilities as stewards—of their infrastructure, but also of their communities. Amid the emphasis on innovative technologies, on development of renewables, on the race to power data centers, it is local utilities that carry the freight of the energy transition. While this is often obscured by the way they are beholden to their quarterly stock price, weighed down by wildfire risk, or operated as regional behemoths that seem to exist as supra-political entities, a place like Lincoln Electric reveals both the possibilities and the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The community gets to dream a little bit, right?” says Anyanwu. Yet “we as the technical Debbie Downers have to come and be like, ‘Well, okay, here’s what you want, and here’s what we can actually do.’ And we’re tempering that dream.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“But you don’t necessarily want a community that just won’t dream at all, that doesn’t have any expectations and doesn’t have any aspirations,” he adds. For Anyanwu, that’s the way through: “I’m willing to help us as an organization dream a little bit—be aspirational, be ambitious, be bold. But at my core and in my heart, I’m a utility operations person.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Blum is the author of &lt;/em&gt;Tubes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Weather Machine&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css","className":"is-style-wide"} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GenLayer, a startup building decentralized legal infrastructure for AI and machine agents, has launched its first incentivized testnet, dubbed Asimov. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This marks the initial rollout of its multi-phase validator onboarding and technology validation initiative as the company moves closer to mainnet deployment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The testnet introduces what GenLayer calls the first Intelligent Blockchain, powered by AI models and designed to resolve subjective decisions typically outside the scope of traditional deterministic blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our narrative is that as we enter a world of AI agents—fast and smart—we need a new legal system because the current one is fragmented, slow, and expensive,” said GenLayer CEO and co-founder Albert Castellana, adding that GenLayer “offers a synthetic jurisdiction: a legal system for machines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-combining-the-best-of-blockchain-and-ai"&gt;Combining the best of blockchain and AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asimov is the first of three sequential testnets in GenLayer’s roadmap, to be followed by Bradbury and Clark. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company aims to progressively test and scale its “Optimistic Democracy” consensus mechanism. Unlike conventional blockchain validators that simply execute code, GenLayer validators are paired with large language models (LLMs), enabling them to evaluate off-chain data and make subjective decisions—such as determining whether submitted content meets campaign requirements or whether a smart contract’s conditions have been fairly fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GenLayer positions this model as essential infrastructure for the coming age of AI agents and machine-to-machine transactions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Castellana, Asimov’s launch is both a stress test and a signal of technical maturity to developers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-professional-validators-and-developer-ecosystem"&gt;Professional validators and developer ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The validator program for Asimov targets seasoned blockchain infrastructure operators. Selected participants will earn rewards for testing consensus logic, transaction handling, and model coordination. GenLayer has already onboarded dozens of validators, with more in the pipeline. Participation requires a full-time commitment during test phases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support builders, GenLayer is releasing a comprehensive developer stack, including the GenLayer Studio, Wallet, Blockchain Explorer, and GS Library (a Python toolkit). The testnet is also paired with a grant program to encourage early development and experimentation ahead of mainnet launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rally-ing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rally-ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with Asimov is the beta release of Rally, a decentralized marketing protocol that automates influencer and community incentive campaigns. Using AI-powered validators, Rally evaluates submitted content — such as social media posts — against campaign rules embedded in smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rally is our first protocol built on GenLayer,” Castellana told VentureBeat. “It autonomously evaluates community-created content and determines compensation, opening participation beyond influencers to anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brands define guidelines (e.g., hashtags, tone, originality), deposit funds, and let the protocol autonomously determine payouts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This setup avoids manual negotiation and performance disputes common in traditional influencer programs. Content creators, in turn, receive transparent, on-chain compensation if their submissions meet preset criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the future, many influencers will be AI agents seeking opportunities to earn—this system accommodates that evolution,” Castellana added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rally operates independently of GenLayer’s core team and will eventually be governed by a DAO. From each campaign pool, 1% goes to the Rally DAO, while 10% of protocol fees are allocated to the developers of participating applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The way I see GenLayer is like a toy factory—creating new tools and mechanisms you can’t find anywhere else,” the CEO added. “Rally is just one example of what’s possible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-benefits-enterprises"&gt;How it benefits enterprises &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For technical decision makers — including brand managers, growth marketers, and digital campaign leads— GenLayer and Rally offer the ability to automate and decentralize campaign execution and quality control. Instead of manually managing influencer relationships, approving content, and disputing post-campaign performance, teams can deploy smart contracts that use LLMs to judge submissions against predefined standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach significantly reduces operational overhead, enables real-time feedback and rewards, and ensures fairness and transparency throughout the campaign lifecycle. Additionally, the use of AI agents allows for scalable campaign management across thousands of potential content contributors—human or automated—without additional headcount or vendor friction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises that regularly invest in brand visibility, product launches, or community engagement, Rally could streamline marketing operations while offering auditable proof of campaign performance. Combined with GenLayer’s broader infrastructure, brands also gain access to AI-driven decision systems for everything from grants disbursement to smart contract enforcement, potentially transforming legal and operational workflows in Web3 contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infrastructure-for-the-ai-native-economy"&gt;Infrastructure for the AI-native economy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GenLayer’s architecture is supported by technical partners including ZKSync (for rollup-based scalability), Heurist (for decentralized model hosting), Atoma Network (for privacy-preserving execution), and Caldera. These integrations ensure that the platform remains performant, secure, and aligned with broader Ethereum-based ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors such as North Island Ventures, Arrington Capital, ZK Ventures, and Arthur Hayes’ Maelstrom. GenLayer sees its protocol as the foundation of a synthetic, global jurisdiction—an autonomous legal layer for the AI economy, capable of settling disputes at machine speed with greater accessibility than traditional legal systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following Asimov, the Bradbury and Clark testnets will introduce validator-level LLM configuration, production-grade inference tuning, and autonomous network operations. Each phase is designed to validate system components ahead of a mainnet launch planned for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GenLayer is actively seeking professional validators and developers to participate in the testnet. Those interested can apply via the company’s website. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With applications like Rally already live in beta, GenLayer presents a new category of intelligent blockchain infrastructure — combining AI decision-making with decentralized governance to unlock more autonomous, transparent, and scalable systems for enterprise and community users alike&lt;/p&gt;

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-billion-dollar-round-club"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The billion-dollar-round club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflection:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wayve: &lt;/strong&gt;In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale AI: &lt;/strong&gt;In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-club"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crusoe: &lt;/strong&gt;A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure AI: &lt;/strong&gt;In February 2024,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistral AI: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda: &lt;/strong&gt;AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohere: &lt;/strong&gt;In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poolside: &lt;/strong&gt;In October, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;AI&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoreWeave: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Together AI: &lt;/strong&gt;In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sakana AI: &lt;/strong&gt;In September, Nvidia invested in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imbue: &lt;/strong&gt;The AI research lab that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waabi: &lt;/strong&gt;In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deals-of-over-a-100-million"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deals of over a $100 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ayar Labs: &lt;/strong&gt;In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kore.ai&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandbox AQ:&lt;/strong&gt; In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocratic AI: &lt;/strong&gt;This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weka: &lt;/strong&gt;In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runway:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bright Machines: &lt;/strong&gt;In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enfabrica: &lt;/strong&gt;In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2183848501.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened in the first half of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off of its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6 – &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4 – &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28 –&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21 – &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S.’s guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which makes chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13 –&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7&lt;/strong&gt;: Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-noncore-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off noncore assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off noncore assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member, Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S.’. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1366897838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s already been a tumultuous year for the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened in the first half of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off of its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6 – &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4 – &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

What began as a noble quest to ensure AI would serve all of humanity is now teetering on the edge of becoming just another corporate giant, chasing immense profits while leaving safety and ethics in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of it all is a plan to tear up the original rulebook. When OpenAI started, it made a crucial promise: it put a cap on how much money investors could make. It was a legal guarantee that if they succeeded in creating world-changing AI, the vast benefits would flow to humanity, not just a handful of billionaires. Now, that promise is on the verge of being erased, apparently to satisfy investors who want unlimited returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the people who built OpenAI, this pivot away from AI safety feels like a profound betrayal. “The non-profit mission was a promise to do the right thing when the stakes got high,” says former staff member Carroll Wainwright. “Now that the stakes are high, the non-profit structure is being abandoned, which means the promise was ultimately empty.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepening-crisis-of-trust"&gt;Deepening crisis of trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these deeply worried voices point to one person: CEO Sam Altman. The concerns are not new. Reports suggest that even at his previous companies, senior colleagues tried to have him removed for what they called “deceptive and chaotic” behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same feeling of mistrust followed him to OpenAI. The company’s own co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, who worked alongside Altman for years, and since launched his own startup, came to a chilling conclusion: “I don’t think Sam is the guy who should have the finger on the button for AGI.” He felt Altman was dishonest and created chaos, a terrifying combination for someone potentially in charge of our collective future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mira Murati, the former CTO, felt just as uneasy. “I don’t feel comfortable about Sam leading us to AGI,” she said. She described a toxic pattern where Altman would tell people what they wanted to hear and then undermine them if they got in his way.

What began as a noble quest to ensure AI would serve all of humanity is now teetering on the edge of becoming just another corporate giant, chasing immense profits while leaving safety and ethics in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of it all is a plan to tear up the original rulebook. When OpenAI started, it made a crucial promise: it put a cap on how much money investors could make. It was a legal guarantee that if they succeeded in creating world-changing AI, the vast benefits would flow to humanity, not just a handful of billionaires. Now, that promise is on the verge of being erased, apparently to satisfy investors who want unlimited returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the people who built OpenAI, this pivot away from AI safety feels like a profound betrayal. “The non-profit mission was a promise to do the right thing when the stakes got high,” says former staff member Carroll Wainwright. “Now that the stakes are high, the non-profit structure is being abandoned, which means the promise was ultimately empty.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepening-crisis-of-trust"&gt;Deepening crisis of trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these deeply worried voices point to one person: CEO Sam Altman. The concerns are not new. Reports suggest that even at his previous companies, senior colleagues tried to have him removed for what they called “deceptive and chaotic” behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same feeling of mistrust followed him to OpenAI. The company’s own co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, who worked alongside Altman for years, and since launched his own startup, came to a chilling conclusion: “I don’t think Sam is the guy who should have the finger on the button for AGI.” He felt Altman was dishonest and created chaos, a terrifying combination for someone potentially in charge of our collective future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mira Murati, the former CTO, felt just as uneasy. “I don’t feel comfortable about Sam leading us to AGI,” she said. She described a toxic pattern where Altman would tell people what they wanted to hear and then undermine them if they got in his way. It suggests manipulation that former OpenAI board member Tasha McCauley says “should be unacceptable” when the AI safety stakes are this high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This crisis of trust has had real-world consequences.
