But in India, it has taken on a creative life of its own, with retro portraits and local trends going viral — even as privacy and safety concerns begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has emerged as the No. 1 country in terms of Nano Banana usage for now, according to David Sharon, multimodal generation lead for Gemini Apps at Google DeepMind, who spoke at a media session this week. The model’s popularity has also propelled the Gemini app to the top of the free app charts on both the App Store and Google Play in India. The app has also climbed to the top of global app stores’ charts, according to Appfigures.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given India’s scale — the world’s second-largest smartphone market and second-biggest online population after China — it is no surprise the country is leading in adoption. But what is catching Google’s attention is not just how many people are using Nano Banana, it is how: Millions of Indians are engaging with the AI model in ways that are uniquely local, highly creative, and in some cases, completely unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the standout trends is Indians using Nano Banana to re-create retro looks inspired by 1990s Bollywood, imagining how they might have appeared during that era, complete with period-specific fashion, hairstyles, and makeup. This trend is local to India, Sharon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A variation of the retro trend is what some are calling the “AI saree,” where users generate vintage-style portraits of themselves wearing traditional Indian attire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046990" height="699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-gemini-app-retro-look-sample.jpg" width="1364" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Nano Banana’s Retro trend sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another trend local to India is people generating their selfies in front of cityscapes and iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben and the U.K.’s retro telephone booths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We saw a lot of that in the beginning,” Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian users are also experimenting with Nano Banana to transform objects, create time-travel effects, and even reimagine themselves as retro postage stamps. Others are generating black-and-white portraits or using the model to visualize encounters with their younger selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these trends did not originate in India, but the country played a key role in helping them gain global attention. One example is the figurine trend, where people generate miniature versions of themselves, often placing them in front of a computer screen. The trend first emerged in Thailand, spread to Indonesia, and became global after gaining traction in India, Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046986" height="1920" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-gemini-app-nano-banana-figurine-sample_eba7c5.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Nano Banana’s Figurine samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to Nano Banana, Google has observed a trend where Indian users are utilizing its Veo 3 AI video-generation model on the Gemini app to create short videos from old photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All of this has helped drive Gemini’s popularity on both the App Store and Google Play in India. Between January and August, the app saw an average of 1.9 million monthly downloads in the country — about 55% higher than in the U.S. — accounting for 16.6% of global monthly downloads, per Appfigures data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India downloads have totaled 15.2 million this year until August; the U.S., on the other hand, has had 9.8 million downloads so far this year, per Appfigures data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Daily downloads of the Gemini app in India significantly surged following the release of the Nano Banana update, beginning on September 1 with 55,000 installs across both app stores. Downloads peaked at 414,000 on September 13 — a 667% increase — with Gemini holding the top overall spot on the iOS App Store since September 10 and on Google Play since September 12, including across all categories, Appfigures data shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046991" height="1176" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gemini-app-daily-downloads.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite India leading in downloads, the country does not top in-app purchases on the Gemini app, which has generated an estimated $6.4 million in global consumer spending on iOS since launch, per Appfigures. The U.S. accounts for the largest share at $2.3 million (35%), while India contributes $95,000 (1.5%). However, India posted a record 18% month-over-month growth in spending, reaching $13,000 between September 1 and 16 — compared to an 11% global increase during the same period. That puts India seven percentage points above the global rate and more than 17 points ahead of the U.S., where growth was under 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, as with other AI apps, there are concerns about users uploading personal photos to Gemini to transform their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When a user asks us to fulfill their query, we do our best to fulfill that query. We don’t try to assume what the user’s intent is,” Sharon said while addressing questions on how Google is dealing with data misuse and privacy concerns among users in India and other top markets. “We’ve really tried to improve that, and we have improved that to be bold and fulfil your request.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google places a visible, diamond-shaped watermark on images generated by the Nano Banana model and also embeds a hidden marker using its SynthID tool to identify AI-generated content. SynthID allows Google to detect and flag whether an image was created using its models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sharon told reporters that Google is testing a detection platform with trusted testers, researchers, and other experts. The company also plans to launch a consumer-facing version that would allow anyone to check whether an image is AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is still day one, and we’re still learning, and we’re learning together. There are things that we might need to improve on in the future, and it’s really your feedback from users, press, academia, and experts that helps us improve,” Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s Nano Banana image-generation model, officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, has fueled global momentum for the Gemini app since launching last month.

It can be made using several low-emissions methods and could play a role in cleaning up industries ranging from agriculture and chemicals to aviation and long-distance shipping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This moment is a complicated one for the green fuel, though, as a new report from the International Energy Agency lays out. A number of major projects face cancellations and delays, especially in the US and Europe. The US in particular is seeing a slowdown after changes to key tax credits and cuts in support for renewable energy. Still, there are bright spots for the industry, including in China, and new markets could soon become crucial for growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are three things to know about the state of hydrogen in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Expectations for annual clean hydrogen production by 2030 are shrinking, for the first time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While hydrogen has the potential to serve as a clean fuel, today most is made with processes that use fossil fuels. As of 2025, about a million metric tons of low-emissions hydrogen are produced annually. That’s less than 1% of total hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In last year’s Global Hydrogen Report, the IEA projected that global production of low-emissions hydrogen would grow to as high as 49 million metric tons annually by 2030. That prediction has been steadily climbing since 2021, as more places around the world sink money into developing and scaling up the technology.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA’s production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s still a major expansion from today’s numbers, but it’s the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world’s electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it’s roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that’s cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;There’s an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there’s been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we’ve seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

 &lt;p&gt;In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA’s production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s still a major expansion from today’s numbers, but it’s the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world’s electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it’s roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that’s cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;There’s an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there’s been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we’ve seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.
