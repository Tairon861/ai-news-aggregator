            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In part 2 of our two-part series on&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;generative artificial intelligence’s environmental impacts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;MIT News &lt;em&gt;explores some of the ways experts are working to reduce the technology’s carbon footprint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy demands of&amp;nbsp;generative AI are expected to continue increasing dramatically over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, an April 2025 report from the International Energy Agency predicts that the&amp;nbsp;global electricity demand from data centers, which house the computing infrastructure to train and deploy AI models, will more than double by 2030, to around 945 terawatt-hours. While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing&amp;nbsp;global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like&amp;nbsp;Meta and&amp;nbsp;Google are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs&amp;nbsp;roughly 10 million square feet — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing operational carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about three-tenths the energy has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging efficiency improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson coined the term “negaflop” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be things like “pruning” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing&amp;nbsp;compression techniques that enable users to do more with less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing energy savings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called&amp;nbsp;GenX, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a&amp;nbsp;data center in Lulea, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of&amp;nbsp;data centers on the moon where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies, AI could play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

With this Opera joins a growing number of companies like Perplexity and The Browser Company that are trying to make agentic browsers happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first announced that it was working on Neon in May, but the browser was in closed preview. It will now start sending invites to select people, who can use the browser for a fee of $19.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We built Opera Neon for ourselves – and for everyone who uses AI extensively in their day-to-day. Today, we’re welcoming the first users who will help shape the future of agentic browsing with us,”&amp;nbsp;said Krystian Kolondra, EVP Browsers at Opera, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are a few key parts of the browser. First, there is a plain old chatbot that you can converse with to get answers to your questions. The more agentic feature of the browser is called Neon Do, which will help you get tasks done. For instance, it can summarize a Substack blog and post the summary to a Slack channel. As the browser has the context of your browsing history, you can also ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera’s new browser can also write snippets of code, which is helpful for you to create visual reports with tables and charts. It is not clear if you can share these mini-apps with others at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Browser Company’s Dia has a feature called Skills, which lets you invoke a prompt repeatedly like a command or an app. Neon lets you build a similar repeatable prompt using cards. Think of this as IFTTT (IF This Then That) of AI prompting. You can combine cards like “pull-details”&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;“comparison-table” to create a new prompt for comparing products across tabs. Just like in Dia, you can build your own Cards or use the ones that are created by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera Neon is also bringing a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs. This feature is more like Tab Groups combined with Arc Browser’s workspaces feature, which has its own context for AI. &lt;/p&gt;

Traditional facilities, built for earlier generations of computing, are struggling to keep up with the heavy energy use and cooling demands of modern AI systems. By 2030, GPU-driven workloads could push rack power densities toward 1 MW, making incremental upgrades no longer enough. Instead, operators are now turning toward purpose-built “AI factory” data centres that are designed from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Paul Churchill, Vice President of Vertiv Asia, to better understand how the region is preparing for this shift and what kinds of infrastructure changes lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explosive market growth is setting the pace&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI data-centre market is projected to surge from $236 billion in 2025 to nearly $934 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by rapid adoption of AI in industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. These sectors rely on high-performance computing environments powered by dense GPU clusters, which require far more energy and cooling capacity than traditional servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia Pacific, this demand is amplified by government investments in digitalisation, the expansion of 5G, and the rollout of cloud-native and generative AI applications. All of this is pushing compute needs higher at a pace the region has never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churchill explained that meeting this demand requires more than just larger facilities. It calls for smarter infrastructure strategies that are scalable and sustainable. “Infrastructure leaders must move beyond piecemeal upgrades. A future-ready strategy involves adopting AI-optimised infrastructure that combines high-capacity power systems, advanced thermal management, and integrated, scalable designs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cooling and power challenges are rising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As rack densities increase from 40 kW to 130 kW, and potentially up to 250 kW by 2030, cooling and power delivery are becoming important issues. Traditional air cooling methods are no longer enough for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, Vertiv is developing hybrid cooling systems that mix direct-to-chip liquid cooling with air-based solutions. Systems can adjust to changing workloads, reduce energy use, and maintain reliability. “Our coolant distribution units enable direct-to-chip liquid cooling while ensuring reliability and serviceability in high-density environments,” Churchill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109637" height="570" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vertiv-headshot-paul-churchill-570x570-1.webp" width="570" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Paul Churchill, Vice President of Vertiv Asia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power delivery is also becoming more complex. AI workloads fluctuate rapidly, so infrastructure needs to react in real time. Vertiv is evolving its rack power distribution units and busway systems to handle higher voltages and improve load balancing. Intelligent monitoring helps operators manage loads more efficiently, reduce wasted capacity, and extend uptime – a key consideration in parts of Southeast Asia where power grids are less stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Data centres are being redesigned for AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of liquid-cooled GPU pods and 1 MW racks, like those planned by AMD and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google, and Meta, signals a deeper architectural shift. Instead of retrofitting older facilities, new data centres are being designed specifically to support AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The future of data-centre architecture is hybrid, and these infrastructures require facilities to be built around liquid flow,” Churchill said. This includes new floor layouts, advanced coolant distribution, and more sophisticated power systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next-generation facilities will integrate cooling, power, and monitoring from the chip level to the grid. For Asia Pacific, where hyperscale campuses are expanding rapidly, this kind of integrated design is essential to keep up with performance expectations and sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From incremental upgrades to AI factory data centres&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2030, Asia Pacific is expected to overtake the US in data centre capacity, reaching almost 24 GW of commissioned power. To handle this growth, enterprises are moving away from ad hoc upgrades toward full-stack AI factory data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churchill said this transition should happen in stages. The first step is integrated planning, bringing together power, cooling, and IT management rather than treating them as separate systems. The approach simplifies deployment and provides a strong base for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to adopt modular and prefabricated systems. These allow companies to add capacity in phases without major disruptions. “Companies can deploy factory-tested modules alongside existing infrastructure, gradually migrating workloads to AI-ready capacity without disruptive overhauls,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sustainability must be built into every stage. This includes using lithium-ion energy storage, grid-interactive UPS systems, and higher-voltage distribution to improve efficiency and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DC power gains new relevance for AI data centres&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertiv recently introduced PowerDirect Rack, a DC power shelf designed for AI and high-performance computing. Switching to DC power can cut energy losses by reducing the number of conversion steps between the grid and the server. It also aligns with renewable energy and battery storage systems, which are becoming more common in Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially useful in energy-constrained markets like Vietnam and the Philippines. In these regions, flexible power solutions are essential to keep facilities running smoothly. As Churchill noted, DC power is “not just an efficiency play – it is a strategy for enabling sustainable scalability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability is becoming a central priority&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI driving up energy use, data-centre operators are facing stricter regulations and rising grid constraints. This is particularly true in Southeast Asia, where power reliability and tariffs vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertiv is working with operators to integrate alternative energy sources like lithium-ion batteries, hybrid power systems, and microgrids. These can reduce dependence on the grid and improve resilience. There is also growing interest in solar-backed UPS systems and advanced energy storage technologies, which help balance loads and manage costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling efficiency is another major focus. Hybrid liquid cooling systems can reduce both energy and water use compared to older methods. “Our focus is on delivering infrastructure that meets performance demands while aligning with ESG goals,” Churchill said. “We’re collaborating with our partners to ensure that AI-driven growth in the region remains responsible, sustainable, and aligned with long-term digital and environmental objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Modular solutions support rapid expansion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many emerging economies in Asia Pacific face challenges like limited land, unstable power supply, and shortages of skilled labour. In these settings, modular and prefabricated data-centre systems offer a practical solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prefabricated modules can cut deployment times by up to 50%, while improving energy efficiency and scalability. They allow operators to expand gradually, adding capacity as needed without heavy upfront investment. The flexibility is especially valuable for AI workloads, which can grow quickly and unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining compact design with energy-efficient operation, modular systems give operators a way to build AI-ready capacity faster and with less risk – a crucial advantage as the region’s digital economies grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing for a demanding future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI surge is reshaping how data centres are built and operated in Asia Pacific. As workloads intensify and sustainability pressures mount, companies can no longer rely on outdated infrastructure. The move toward AI factory data centres, powered by advanced cooling, DC power, and modular systems, reflects a shift in how the region is preparing for the next era of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by İsmail Enes Ayhan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Traditional facilities, built for earlier generations of computing, are struggling to keep up with the heavy energy use and cooling demands of modern AI systems. By 2030, GPU-driven workloads could push rack power densities toward 1 MW, making incremental upgrades no longer enough. Instead, operators are now turning toward purpose-built “AI factory” data centres that are designed from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Paul Churchill, Vice President of Vertiv Asia, to better understand how the region is preparing for this shift and what kinds of infrastructure changes lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explosive market growth is setting the pace&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI data-centre market is projected to surge from $236 billion in 2025 to nearly $934 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by rapid adoption of AI in industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. These sectors rely on high-performance computing environments powered by dense GPU clusters, which require far more energy and cooling capacity than traditional servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia Pacific, this demand is amplified by government investments in digitalisation, the expansion of 5G, and the rollout of cloud-native and generative AI applications. All of this is pushing compute needs higher at a pace the region has never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churchill explained that meeting this demand requires more than just larger facilities. It calls for smarter infrastructure strategies that are scalable and sustainable. “Infrastructure leaders must move beyond piecemeal upgrades. A future-ready strategy involves adopting AI-optimised infrastructure that combines high-capacity power systems, advanced thermal management, and integrated, scalable designs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cooling and power challenges are rising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As rack densities increase from 40 kW to 130 kW, and potentially up to 250 kW by 2030, cooling and power delivery are becoming important issues. Traditional air cooling methods are no longer enough for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, Vertiv is developing hybrid cooling systems that mix direct-to-chip liquid cooling with air-based solutions. Systems can adjust to changing workloads, reduce energy use, and maintain reliability. “Our coolant distribution units enable direct-to-chip liquid cooling while ensuring reliability and serviceability in high-density environments,” Churchill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109637" height="570" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vertiv-headshot-paul-churchill-570x570-1.webp" width="570" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Paul Churchill, Vice President of Vertiv Asia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power delivery is also becoming more complex. AI workloads fluctuate rapidly, so infrastructure needs to react in real time. Vertiv is evolving its rack power distribution units and busway systems to handle higher voltages and improve load balancing. Intelligent monitoring helps operators manage loads more efficiently, reduce wasted capacity, and extend uptime – a key consideration in parts of Southeast Asia where power grids are less stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Data centres are being redesigned for AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of liquid-cooled GPU pods and 1 MW racks, like those planned by AMD and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google, and Meta, signals a deeper architectural shift. Instead of retrofitting older facilities, new data centres are being designed specifically to support AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The future of data-centre architecture is hybrid, and these infrastructures require facilities to be built around liquid flow,” Churchill said. This includes new floor layouts, advanced coolant distribution, and more sophisticated power systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next-generation facilities will integrate cooling, power, and monitoring from the chip level to the grid. For Asia Pacific, where hyperscale campuses are expanding rapidly, this kind of integrated design is essential to keep up with performance expectations and sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From incremental upgrades to AI factory data centres&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2030, Asia Pacific is expected to overtake the US in data centre capacity, reaching almost 24 GW of commissioned power. To handle this growth, enterprises are moving away from ad hoc upgrades toward full-stack AI factory data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churchill said this transition should happen in stages. The first step is integrated planning, bringing together power, cooling, and IT management rather than treating them as separate systems. The approach simplifies deployment and provides a strong base for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to adopt modular and prefabricated systems. These allow companies to add capacity in phases without major disruptions. “Companies can deploy factory-tested modules alongside existing infrastructure, gradually migrating workloads to AI-ready capacity without disruptive overhauls,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sustainability must be built into every stage. This includes using lithium-ion energy storage, grid-interactive UPS systems, and higher-voltage distribution to improve efficiency and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DC power gains new relevance for AI data centres&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertiv recently introduced PowerDirect Rack, a DC power shelf designed for AI and high-performance computing. Switching to DC power can cut energy losses by reducing the number of conversion steps between the grid and the server. It also aligns with renewable energy and battery storage systems, which are becoming more common in Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially useful in energy-constrained markets like Vietnam and the Philippines. In these regions, flexible power solutions are essential to keep facilities running smoothly. As Churchill noted, DC power is “not just an efficiency play – it is a strategy for enabling sustainable scalability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability is becoming a central priority&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI driving up energy use, data-centre operators are facing stricter regulations and rising grid constraints.

What I encountered instead was a comprehensive automotive sound engineering operation that challenges the established order of in-car audio systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility, which Huawei has developed since beginning serious audio research investments in 2012, houses three distinct testing environments: a fully anechoic chamber measuring&amp;nbsp;4.8x4x4&amp;nbsp;metres, a larger semi-anechoic room spanning&amp;nbsp;14x12x5&amp;nbsp;metres with a reflective floor, and a dedicated listening room configured in a 9.1.6 layout.&amp;nbsp;Photography&amp;nbsp;wasn’t permitted&amp;nbsp;due to proprietary technology concerns, but the technical specifications tell their own story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt; [embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-challenge-of-in-car-audio"&gt;The challenge of in-car audio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goller, whose background includes positions at Gamut Audio, Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen, and Harman International, oversees what Huawei calls “master-tuning methodology” – a process that begins with objective acoustic measurements but relies heavily on psychoacoustic principles for final voicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the listening room during the first agenda of the tour, Goller outlined Huawei’s development philosophy: the aim is to faithfully reproduce recordings as artists intended them to&amp;nbsp;be heard, creating what he described as a “phantom effect” that transports listeners to the original recording environment.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;requires combining scientific acoustic measurement with artistic tuning expertise and purpose-built hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical process, he explained, starts with objective measurements – frequency response curves, phase relationships, timing behaviour, and distortion characteristics. These establish the performance boundaries. From there, extensive subjective listening sessions refine the voicing using psychoacoustic principles to compensate for the cabin’s inherent acoustic challenges: asymmetry, close-range reflections, and bass loading.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to work within these constraints while remaining faithful to the source material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-huawei-sound-ultimate-series"&gt;The HUAWEI SOUND ULTIMATE Series&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109643" height="683" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Inside-of-the-Maextro-S800-luxury-electric-sedan-1-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of Maextro S800 luxury electric sedan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Photo by HUAWEI SOUND)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangible result of this research is the HUAWEI SOUND ULTIMATE Series, the tech giant’s most luxurious audio system to date, currently deployed in the Maextro S800 luxury electric sedan.&amp;nbsp;The system comprises 43 speakers driven by dual amplifiers delivering 2,920 watts&amp;nbsp;total&amp;nbsp;power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Huawei terms an “industry-first seat-specific 4D immersive surround sound experience” includes rear 4D exciters that synchronise with music and video content, adding tactile feedback to the auditory experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware innovations are specific rather than generic.

The company states that approximately CNY 60 billion (roughly £6.6 billion / €7.8 billion) goes specifically to fundamental science research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers contextualise Huawei’s automotive sound engineering ambitions. The company currently supplies solutions to over twenty automakers, spanning driver assistance, cockpit systems, acoustics, and control. However, Huawei positions itself as a component supplier – individual automakers determine market availability and regional launches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-implications"&gt;Market implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automotive sound engineering landscape has traditionally been dominated by established European brands. Huawei’s systematic approach – purpose-built testing facilities, recruited expertise from legacy audio companies, and significant capital investment – represents a challenge to that established order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether Huawei can build impressive technology demonstrations.

The combination of measurement-driven development and subjective tuning refinement represents standard practice in high-end audio,&amp;nbsp;adapted&amp;nbsp;for automotive contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to market success depends on factors beyond acoustic performance: production scalability, supply chain integration with diverse automakers, and ultimately, whether consumers value independent sound zones and advanced tuning enough to pay premium prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei has built the technical foundation. The commercial proof will emerge as these systems move from flagship demonstrations into broader automotive lineups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Huawei details open-source AI development roadmap at Huawei Connect 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

In recent years, a crack has formed in the middle of a house. Sewage has leached into the earth. Soil has eroded around buildings, leaving them perched atop precarious lumps of dirt. There are eternal puddles. And mold. The ground can feel squishy, sodden.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This small town in northern Alaska is experiencing a sometimes overlooked consequence of climate change: thawing permafrost. And Nunapitchuk is far from the only Arctic town to find itself in such a predicament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Permafrost, which lies beneath about 15% of the land in the Northern Hemisphere, is defined as ground that has remained frozen for at least two years. Historically, much of the world’s permafrost has remained solid and stable for far longer, allowing people to build whole towns atop it. But as the planet warms, a process that is happening more rapidly near the poles than at more temperate latitudes, permafrost is thawing and causing a host of infrastructural and environmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now scientists think they may be able to use satellite data to delve deep beneath the ground’s surface and get a better understanding of how the permafrost thaws, and which areas might be most severely affected because they had more ice to start with. Clues from the short-term behavior of those especially icy areas, seen from space, could portend future problems.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Using information gathered both from space and on the ground, they are working with affected communities to anticipate whether a house’s foundation will crack—and whether it is worth mending that crack or is better to start over in a new house on a stable hilltop. These scientists’ permafrost predictions are already helping communities like Nunapitchuk make those tough calls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just civilian homes that are at risk. One of the top US intelligence agencies, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), is also interested in understanding permafrost better. That’s because the same problems that plague civilians in the high north also plague military infrastructure, at home and abroad. The NGA is, essentially, an organization full of space spies—people who analyze data from surveillance satellites and make sense of it for the country’s national security apparatus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the potential instabilities of the Alaskan military infrastructure—which includes radar stations that watch for intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as military bases and National Guard posts—is key to keeping those facilities in good working order and planning for their strengthened future. Understanding the potential permafrost weaknesses that could affect the infrastructure of countries like Russia and China, meanwhile, affords what insiders might call “situational awareness” about competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work to understand this thawing will only become more relevant, for civilians and their governments alike, as the world continues to warm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ground beneath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you live much below the Arctic Circle, you probably don’t think a lot about permafrost. But it affects you no matter where you call home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to the infrastructural consequences for real towns like Nunapitchuk, thawing permafrost contains sequestered carbon—twice as much as currently inhabits the atmosphere. As the permafrost thaws, the process can release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That release can cause a feedback loop: Warmer temperatures thaw permafrost, which releases greenhouse gases, which warms the air more, which then—you get it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The microbes themselves, along with previously trapped heavy metals, are also set dangerously free.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many years, researchers’ primary options for understanding some of these freeze-thaw changes involved hands-on, on-the-ground surveys. But in the late 2000s, Kevin Schaefer, currently a senior scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, started to investigate a less labor-intensive idea: using radar systems aboard satellites to survey the ground beneath.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea implanted itself in his brain in 2009, when he traveled to a place called Toolik Lake, southwest of the oilfields of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. One day, after hours of drilling sample cores out of the ground to study permafrost, he was relaxing in the Quonset hut, chatting with colleagues. They began to discuss how&amp;nbsp; space-based radar could potentially detect how the land sinks and heaves back up as temperatures change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huh&lt;/em&gt;, he thought. &lt;em&gt;Yes,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;radar probably could do that&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists call the ground right above permafrost the active layer. The water in this layer of soil contracts and expands with the seasons: during the summer, the ice suffusing the soil melts and the resulting decrease in volume causes the ground to dip. During the winter, the water freezes and expands, bulking the active layer back up. Radar can help measure that height difference, which is usually around one to five centimeters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Schaefer realized that he could use radar to measure the ground elevation at the start and end of the thaw. The electromagnetic waves that bounce back at those two times would have traveled slightly different distances. That difference would reveal the tiny shift in elevation over the seasons and would allow him to estimate how much water had thawed and refrozen in the active layer and how far below the surface the thaw had extended.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With radar, Schaefer realized, scientists could cover a lot more literal ground, with less effort and at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It took us two years to figure out how to write a paper on it,” he says; no one had ever made those measurements before. He and colleagues presented the idea at the 2010 meeting of the American Geophysical Union and published a paper in 2012 detailing the method, using it to estimate the thickness of the active layer on Alaska’s North Slope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When they did, they helped start a new subfield that grew as large-scale data sets started to become available around 5 to 10 years ago, says Roger Michaelides, a geophysicist&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at Washington University in St. Louis and a collaborator of Schaefer’s. Researchers’ efforts were aided by the growth in space radar systems and smaller, cheaper satellites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the availability of global data sets (sometimes for free, from government-run satellites like the European Space Agency’s Sentinel) and targeted observations from commercial companies like Iceye, permafrost studies are moving from bespoke regional analyses to more automated, large-scale monitoring and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The remote view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simon Zwieback, a geospatial and environmental expert at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, sees the consequences of thawing permafrost firsthand every day. His office overlooks a university parking lot, a corner of which is fenced off to keep cars and pedestrians from falling into a brand-new sinkhole. That area of asphalt had been slowly sagging for more than a year, but over a week or two this spring, it finally started to collapse inward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124554" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KS_81917_45_Schaefer.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Kevin Schaefer stands on top of a melting layer of ice near the Alaskan pipeline on the North Slope of Alaska.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF KEVIN SCHAEFER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new remote research methods are a large-scale version of Zwieback taking in the view from his window. Researchers look at the ground and measure how its height changes as ice thaws and refreezes. The approach can cover wide swaths of land, but it involves making assumptions about what’s going on below the surface—namely, how much ice suffuses the soil in the active layer and permafrost. Thawing areas with relatively low ice content could mimic thinner layers with more ice. And it’s important to differentiate the two, since more ice in the permafrost means more potential instability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To check that they’re on the right track, scientists have historically had to go out into the field. But a few years ago, Zwieback started to explore a way to make better and deeper estimates of ice content using the available remote sensing data. Finding a way to make those kinds of measurements on a large scale was more than an academic exercise: Areas of what he calls “excess ice” are most liable to cause instability at the surface. “In order to plan in these environments, we really need to know how much ice there is, or where those locations are that are rich in ice,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zwieback, who did his undergraduate and graduate studies in Switzerland and Austria, wasn’t always so interested in permafrost, or so deeply affected by it. But in 2014, when he was a doctoral student in environmental engineering, he joined an environmental field campaign in Siberia, at the Lena River Delta, which resembles a gigantic piece of coral fanning out into the Arctic Ocean. Zwieback was near a town called Tiksi, one of the world’s northernmost settlements. It’s a military outpost and starting point for expeditions to the North Pole, featuring an abandoned plane near the ocean. Its Soviet-era concrete buildings sometimes bring it to the front page of the r/UrbanHell subreddit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Here, Zwieback saw part of the coastline collapse, exposing almost pure ice. It looked like a subterranean glacier, but it was permafrost. “That really had an indelible impact on me,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Later, as a doctoral student in Zurich and postdoc in Canada, he used his radar skills to understand the rapid changes that the activity of permafrost impressed upon the landscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now, with his job in Fairbanks and his ideas about the use of radar sensing, he has done work funded by the NGA, which has an open Arctic data portal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his Arctic research, Zwieback started with the approach underlying most radar permafrost studies: looking at the ground’s seasonal subsidence and heave. “But that’s something that happens very close to the surface,” he says. “It doesn’t really tell us about these long-term destabilizing effects,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In warmer summers, he thought, subtle clues would emerge that could indicate how much ice is buried deeper down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, he expected those warmer-than-average periods to exaggerate the amount of change seen on the surface, making it easier to tell which areas are ice-rich. Land that was particularly dense with ice would dip more than it “should”—a precursor of bigger dips to come.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The first step, then, was to measure subsidence directly, as usual. But from there, Zwieback developed an algorithm to ingest data about the subsidence over time—as measured by radar—and other environmental information, like the temperatures at each measurement. He then created a digital model of the land that allowed him to adjust the simulated amount of ground ice and determine when it matched the subsidence seen in the real world. With that, researchers could infer the amount of ice beneath.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next, he made maps of that ice that could potentially be useful to engineers—whether they were planning a new subdivision or, as his funders might be, keeping watch on a military airfield.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What was new in my work was to look at these much shorter periods and use them to understand specific aspects of this whole system, and specifically how much ice there is deep down,” Zwieback says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The NGA, which has also funded Schaefer’s work, did not respond to an initial request for comment but did later provide feedback for fact-checking. It removed an article on its website about Zwieback’s grant and its application to agency interests around the time that the current presidential administration began to ban mention of climate change in federal research. But the thawing earth is of keen concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start, the US has significant military infrastructure in Alaska: It’s home to six military bases and 49 National Guard posts, as well as 21 missile-detecting radar sites. Most are vulnerable to thaw now or in the near future, given that 85% of the state is on permafrost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond American borders, the broader north is in a state of tension. Russia’s relations with Northern Europe are icy. Its invasion of Ukraine has left those countries fearing that they too could be invaded, prompting Sweden and Finland, for instance, to join NATO. The US has threatened takeovers of Greenland and Canada. And China—which has shipping and resource ambitions for the region—is jockeying to surpass the US as the premier superpower.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Permafrost plays a role in the situation. “As knowledge has expanded, so has the understanding that thawing permafrost can affect things NGA cares about, including the stability of infrastructure in Russia and China,” read the NGA article. Permafrost covers 60% of Russia, and thaws have affected more than 40% of buildings in northern Russia already, according to statements from the country’s minister of natural resources in 2021. Experts say critical infrastructure like roads and pipelines is at risk, along with military installations. That could weaken both Russia’s strategic position and the security of its residents. In China, meanwhile, according to a report from the Council on Strategic Risks, important moving parts like the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, “which allows Beijing to more quickly move military personnel near contested areas of the Indian border,” is susceptible to ground thaw—as are oil and gas pipelines linking Russia and China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any permafrost analysis that relies on data from space requires verification on Earth. The hope is that remote methods will become reliable enough to use on their own, but while they’re being developed, researchers must still get their hands muddy with more straightforward and longer tested physical methods. Some use a network called Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring, which has existed since 1991, incorporating active-layer data from hundreds of measurement sites across the Northern Hemisphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, that data comes from people physically probing an area; other sites use tubes permanently inserted into the ground, filled with a liquid that indicates freezing; still others use underground cables that measure soil temperature. Some researchers, like Schaefer, lug ground-penetrating radar systems around the tundra. He’s taken his system to around 50 sites and made more than 200,000 measurements of the active layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The field-ready ground-penetrating radar comes in a big box—the size of a steamer trunk—that emits radio pulses. These pulses bounce off the bottom of the active layer, or the top of the permafrost. In this case, the timing of that reflection reveals how thick the active layer is. With handles designed for humans, Schaefer’s team drags this box around the Arctic’s boggier areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The box floats. “I do not,” he says. He has vivid memories of tromping through wetlands, his legs pushing straight down through the muck, his body sinking up to his hips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124553" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EJ_0057_Schaefer.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Andy Parsekian and Kevin Schaefer haul a ground penetrating radar unit through the tundra near Utqiagvik.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF KEVIN SCHAEFER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zwieback also needs to verify what he infers from his space data. And so in 2022, he went to the Toolik Field station, a National Science Foundation–funded ecology research facility along the Dalton Highway and adjacent to Schaefer’s Toolik Lake. This road, which goes from Fairbanks up to the Arctic Ocean, is colloquially called the Haul Road; it was made famous in the TV show &lt;em&gt;Ice Road Truckers&lt;/em&gt;. From this access point, Zwieback’s team needed to get deep samples of soil whose ice content could be analyzed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every day, two teams would drive along the Dalton Highway to get close to their field sites. Slamming their car doors, they would unload and hop on snow machines to travel the final distance. Often they would see musk oxen, looking like bison that never cut their hair. The grizzlies were also interested in these oxen, and in the nearby caribou.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the sites they could reach, they took out a corer, a long, tubular piece of equipment driven by a gas engine, meant to drill deep into the ground. Zwieback or a teammate pressed it into the earth. The barrel’s two blades rotated, slicing a cylinder about five feet down to ensure that their samples went deep enough to generate data that can be compared with the measurements made from space. Then they pulled up and extracted the cylinder, a sausage of earth and ice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All day every day for a week, they gathered cores that matched up with the pixels in radar images taken from space. In those cores, the ice was apparent to the eye. But Zwieback didn’t want anecdata. “We want to get a number,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So he and his team would pack their soil cylinders back to the lab. There they sliced them into segments and measured their volume, in both their frozen and their thawed form, to see how well the measured ice content matched estimates from the space-based algorithm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial validation, which took months, demonstrated the value of using satellites for permafrost work. The ice profiles that Zwieback’s algorithm inferred from the satellite data matched measurements in the lab down to about 1.1 feet, and farther in a warm year, with some uncertainty near the surface and deeper into the permafrost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whereas it cost tens of thousands of dollars to fly in on a helicopter, drive in a car, and switch to a snowmobile to ultimately sample a small area using your hands, only to have to continue the work at home, the team needed just a few hundred dollars to run the algorithm on satellite data that was free and publicly available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michaelides, who is familiar with Zwieback’s work, agrees that estimating excess ice content is key to making infrastructural decisions, and that historical methods of sussing it out have been costly in all senses. Zwieback’s method of using late-summer clues to infer what’s going on at that depth “is a very exciting idea,” he says, and the results “demonstrate that there is considerable promise for this approach.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He notes, though, that using space-based radar to understand the thawing ground is complicated: Ground ice content, soil moisture, and vegetation can differ even within a single pixel that a satellite can pick out. “To be clear, this limitation is not unique to Simon's work,” Michaelides says; it affects all space-radar methods. There is also excess ice below even where Zwieback’s algorithm can probe—something the labor-intensive on-ground methods can pick up that still can’t be seen from space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping out the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Zwieback did his fieldwork, NGA decided to do its own. The agency’s attempt to independently validate his work—in Prudhoe Bay, Utqiagvik, and Fairbanks—was part of a project it called Frostbyte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its partners in that project—the Army’s Cold Regions Research Engineering Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory—declined requests for interviews. As far as Zwieback knows, they’re still analyzing data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the intelligence community isn’t the only group interested in research like Zwieback’s. He also works with Arctic residents, reaching out to rural Alaskan communities where people are trying to make decisions about whether to relocate or where to build safely. “They typically can’t afford to do expensive coring,” he says. “So the idea is to make these data available to them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124555" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20230503_215840564.MP_.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Zwieback and his team haul their gear out to gather data from drilled core samples, a process which can be arduous  and costly.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ANDREW JOHNSON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schaefer is also trying to bridge the gap between his science and the people it affects. Through a company called Weather Stream, he is helping communities identify risks to infrastructure before anything collapses, so they can take preventative action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making such connections has always been a key concern for Erin Trochim, a geospatial scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As a researcher who works not just on permafrost but also on policy, she’s seen radar science progress massively in recent years—without commensurate advances on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, it’s still hard for residents in her town of Fairbanks—or anywhere—to know if there’s permafrost on their property at all, unless they’re willing to do expensive drilling. She’s encountered this problem, still unsolved, on property she owns. And if an expert can’t figure it out, non-experts hardly stand a chance. “It’s just frustrating when a lot of this information that we know from the science side, and [that’s] trickled through the engineering side, hasn’t really translated into the on-the-ground construction,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a group, though, trying to turn that trickle into a flood: Permafrost Pathways, a venture that launched with a $41 million grant through the TED Audacious Project. In concert with affected communities, including Nunapitchuk, it is building a data-gathering network on the ground, and combining information from that network with satellite data and local knowledge to help understand permafrost thaw and develop adaptation strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think about it often as if you got a diagnosis of a disease,” says Sue Natali, the head of the project. “It’s terrible, but it’s also really great, because when you know what your problem is and what you’re dealing with, it’s only then that you can actually make a plan to address it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the communities Permafrost Pathways works with are making plans. Nunapitchuk has decided to relocate, and the town and the research group have collaboratively surveyed the proposed new location: a higher spot on hardpacked sand. Permafrost Pathways scientists were able to help validate the stability of the new site—and prove to policymakers that this stability would extend into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Radar helps with that in part, Natali says, because unlike other satellite detectors, it penetrates clouds. “In Alaska, it’s extremely cloudy,” she says. “So other data sets have been very, very challenging. Sometimes we get one image per year.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And so radar data, and algorithms like Zwieback’s that help scientists and communities make sense of that data, dig up deeper insight into what’s going on beneath northerners’ feet—and how to step forward on firmer ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Scoles is a freelance science journalist based in southern Colorado and the author, most recently, of the book &lt;/em&gt;Countdown: The Blinding Future of Nuclear Weapons&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something is rotten in the city of Nunapitchuk. In recent years, a crack has formed in the middle of a house. Sewage has leached into the earth. Soil has eroded around buildings, leaving them perched atop precarious lumps of dirt. There are eternal puddles. And mold. The ground can feel squishy, sodden.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This small town in northern Alaska is experiencing a sometimes overlooked consequence of climate change: thawing permafrost. And Nunapitchuk is far from the only Arctic town to find itself in such a predicament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Permafrost, which lies beneath about 15% of the land in the Northern Hemisphere, is defined as ground that has remained frozen for at least two years. Historically, much of the world’s permafrost has remained solid and stable for far longer, allowing people to build whole towns atop it. But as the planet warms, a process that is happening more rapidly near the poles than at more temperate latitudes, permafrost is thawing and causing a host of infrastructural and environmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now scientists think they may be able to use satellite data to delve deep beneath the ground’s surface and get a better understanding of how the permafrost thaws, and which areas might be most severely affected because they had more ice to start with. Clues from the short-term behavior of those especially icy areas, seen from space, could portend future problems.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Using information gathered both from space and on the ground, they are working with affected communities to anticipate whether a house’s foundation will crack—and whether it is worth mending that crack or is better to start over in a new house on a stable hilltop. These scientists’ permafrost predictions are already helping communities like Nunapitchuk make those tough calls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just civilian homes that are at risk. One of the top US intelligence agencies, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), is also interested in understanding permafrost better. That’s because the same problems that plague civilians in the high north also plague military infrastructure, at home and abroad. The NGA is, essentially, an organization full of space spies—people who analyze data from surveillance satellites and make sense of it for the country’s national security apparatus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the potential instabilities of the Alaskan military infrastructure—which includes radar stations that watch for intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as military bases and National Guard posts—is key to keeping those facilities in good working order and planning for their strengthened future. Understanding the potential permafrost weaknesses that could affect the infrastructure of countries like Russia and China, meanwhile, affords what insiders might call “situational awareness” about competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The work to understand this thawing will only become more relevant, for civilians and their governments alike, as the world continues to warm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ground beneath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you live much below the Arctic Circle, you probably don’t think a lot about permafrost. But it affects you no matter where you call home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to the infrastructural consequences for real towns like Nunapitchuk, thawing permafrost contains sequestered carbon—twice as much as currently inhabits the atmosphere. As the permafrost thaws, the process can release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That release can cause a feedback loop: Warmer temperatures thaw permafrost, which releases greenhouse gases, which warms the air more, which then—you get it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The microbes themselves, along with previously trapped heavy metals, are also set dangerously free.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many years, researchers’ primary options for understanding some of these freeze-thaw changes involved hands-on, on-the-ground surveys. But in the late 2000s, Kevin Schaefer, currently a senior scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, started to investigate a less labor-intensive idea: using radar systems aboard satellites to survey the ground beneath.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea implanted itself in his brain in 2009, when he traveled to a place called Toolik Lake, southwest of the oilfields of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. One day, after hours of drilling sample cores out of the ground to study permafrost, he was relaxing in the Quonset hut, chatting with colleagues. They began to discuss how&amp;nbsp; space-based radar could potentially detect how the land sinks and heaves back up as temperatures change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huh&lt;/em&gt;, he thought. &lt;em&gt;Yes,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;radar probably could do that&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists call the ground right above permafrost the active layer. The water in this layer of soil contracts and expands with the seasons: during the summer, the ice suffusing the soil melts and the resulting decrease in volume causes the ground to dip. During the winter, the water freezes and expands, bulking the active layer back up. Radar can help measure that height difference, which is usually around one to five centimeters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Schaefer realized that he could use radar to measure the ground elevation at the start and end of the thaw. The electromagnetic waves that bounce back at those two times would have traveled slightly different distances. That difference would reveal the tiny shift in elevation over the seasons and would allow him to estimate how much water had thawed and refrozen in the active layer and how far below the surface the thaw had extended.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With radar, Schaefer realized, scientists could cover a lot more literal ground, with less effort and at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It took us two years to figure out how to write a paper on it,” he says; no one had ever made those measurements before. He and colleagues presented the idea at the 2010 meeting of the American Geophysical Union and published a paper in 2012 detailing the method, using it to estimate the thickness of the active layer on Alaska’s North Slope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When they did, they helped start a new subfield that grew as large-scale data sets started to become available around 5 to 10 years ago, says Roger Michaelides, a geophysicist&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at Washington University in St. Louis and a collaborator of Schaefer’s. Researchers’ efforts were aided by the growth in space radar systems and smaller, cheaper satellites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the availability of global data sets (sometimes for free, from government-run satellites like the European Space Agency’s Sentinel) and targeted observations from commercial companies like Iceye, permafrost studies are moving from bespoke regional analyses to more automated, large-scale monitoring and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The remote view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simon Zwieback, a geospatial and environmental expert at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, sees the consequences of thawing permafrost firsthand every day. His office overlooks a university parking lot, a corner of which is fenced off to keep cars and pedestrians from falling into a brand-new sinkhole. That area of asphalt had been slowly sagging for more than a year, but over a week or two this spring, it finally started to collapse inward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124554" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KS_81917_45_Schaefer.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Kevin Schaefer stands on top of a melting layer of ice near the Alaskan pipeline on the North Slope of Alaska.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF KEVIN SCHAEFER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new remote research methods are a large-scale version of Zwieback taking in the view from his window. Researchers look at the ground and measure how its height changes as ice thaws and refreezes. The approach can cover wide swaths of land, but it involves making assumptions about what’s going on below the surface—namely, how much ice suffuses the soil in the active layer and permafrost. Thawing areas with relatively low ice content could mimic thinner layers with more ice. And it’s important to differentiate the two, since more ice in the permafrost means more potential instability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To check that they’re on the right track, scientists have historically had to go out into the field. But a few years ago, Zwieback started to explore a way to make better and deeper estimates of ice content using the available remote sensing data. Finding a way to make those kinds of measurements on a large scale was more than an academic exercise: Areas of what he calls “excess ice” are most liable to cause instability at the surface. “In order to plan in these environments, we really need to know how much ice there is, or where those locations are that are rich in ice,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zwieback, who did his undergraduate and graduate studies in Switzerland and Austria, wasn’t always so interested in permafrost, or so deeply affected by it. But in 2014, when he was a doctoral student in environmental engineering, he joined an environmental field campaign in Siberia, at the Lena River Delta, which resembles a gigantic piece of coral fanning out into the Arctic Ocean. Zwieback was near a town called Tiksi, one of the world’s northernmost settlements. It’s a military outpost and starting point for expeditions to the North Pole, featuring an abandoned plane near the ocean. Its Soviet-era concrete buildings sometimes bring it to the front page of the r/UrbanHell subreddit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Here, Zwieback saw part of the coastline collapse, exposing almost pure ice. It looked like a subterranean glacier, but it was permafrost. “That really had an indelible impact on me,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Later, as a doctoral student in Zurich and postdoc in Canada, he used his radar skills to understand the rapid changes that the activity of permafrost impressed upon the landscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now, with his job in Fairbanks and his ideas about the use of radar sensing, he has done work funded by the NGA, which has an open Arctic data portal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his Arctic research, Zwieback started with the approach underlying most radar permafrost studies: looking at the ground’s seasonal subsidence and heave. “But that’s something that happens very close to the surface,” he says. “It doesn’t really tell us about these long-term destabilizing effects,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In warmer summers, he thought, subtle clues would emerge that could indicate how much ice is buried deeper down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, he expected those warmer-than-average periods to exaggerate the amount of change seen on the surface, making it easier to tell which areas are ice-rich. Land that was particularly dense with ice would dip more than it “should”—a precursor of bigger dips to come.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The first step, then, was to measure subsidence directly, as usual. But from there, Zwieback developed an algorithm to ingest data about the subsidence over time—as measured by radar—and other environmental information, like the temperatures at each measurement. He then created a digital model of the land that allowed him to adjust the simulated amount of ground ice and determine when it matched the subsidence seen in the real world. With that, researchers could infer the amount of ice beneath.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next, he made maps of that ice that could potentially be useful to engineers—whether they were planning a new subdivision or, as his funders might be, keeping watch on a military airfield.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What was new in my work was to look at these much shorter periods and use them to understand specific aspects of this whole system, and specifically how much ice there is deep down,” Zwieback says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The NGA, which has also funded Schaefer’s work, did not respond to an initial request for comment but did later provide feedback for fact-checking. It removed an article on its website about Zwieback’s grant and its application to agency interests around the time that the current presidential administration began to ban mention of climate change in federal research. But the thawing earth is of keen concern.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start, the US has significant military infrastructure in Alaska: It’s home to six military bases and 49 National Guard posts, as well as 21 missile-detecting radar sites. Most are vulnerable to thaw now or in the near future, given that 85% of the state is on permafrost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond American borders, the broader north is in a state of tension. Russia’s relations with Northern Europe are icy. Its invasion of Ukraine has left those countries fearing that they too could be invaded, prompting Sweden and Finland, for instance, to join NATO. The US has threatened takeovers of Greenland and Canada. And China—which has shipping and resource ambitions for the region—is jockeying to surpass the US as the premier superpower.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Permafrost plays a role in the situation. “As knowledge has expanded, so has the understanding that thawing permafrost can affect things NGA cares about, including the stability of infrastructure in Russia and China,” read the NGA article. Permafrost covers 60% of Russia, and thaws have affected more than 40% of buildings in northern Russia already, according to statements from the country’s minister of natural resources in 2021. Experts say critical infrastructure like roads and pipelines is at risk, along with military installations. That could weaken both Russia’s strategic position and the security of its residents. In China, meanwhile, according to a report from the Council on Strategic Risks, important moving parts like the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, “which allows Beijing to more quickly move military personnel near contested areas of the Indian border,” is susceptible to ground thaw—as are oil and gas pipelines linking Russia and China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any permafrost analysis that relies on data from space requires verification on Earth. The hope is that remote methods will become reliable enough to use on their own, but while they’re being developed, researchers must still get their hands muddy with more straightforward and longer tested physical methods. Some use a network called Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring, which has existed since 1991, incorporating active-layer data from hundreds of measurement sites across the Northern Hemisphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, that data comes from people physically probing an area; other sites use tubes permanently inserted into the ground, filled with a liquid that indicates freezing; still others use underground cables that measure soil temperature. Some researchers, like Schaefer, lug ground-penetrating radar systems around the tundra. He’s taken his system to around 50 sites and made more than 200,000 measurements of the active layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The field-ready ground-penetrating radar comes in a big box—the size of a steamer trunk—that emits radio pulses. These pulses bounce off the bottom of the active layer, or the top of the permafrost. In this case, the timing of that reflection reveals how thick the active layer is. With handles designed for humans, Schaefer’s team drags this box around the Arctic’s boggier areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The box floats. “I do not,” he says. He has vivid memories of tromping through wetlands, his legs pushing straight down through the muck, his body sinking up to his hips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124553" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EJ_0057_Schaefer.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Andy Parsekian and Kevin Schaefer haul a ground penetrating radar unit through the tundra near Utqiagvik.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF KEVIN SCHAEFER&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zwieback also needs to verify what he infers from his space data. And so in 2022, he went to the Toolik Field station, a National Science Foundation–funded ecology research facility along the Dalton Highway and adjacent to Schaefer’s Toolik Lake. This road, which goes from Fairbanks up to the Arctic Ocean, is colloquially called the Haul Road; it was made famous in the TV show &lt;em&gt;Ice Road Truckers&lt;/em&gt;. From this access point, Zwieback’s team needed to get deep samples of soil whose ice content could be analyzed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every day, two teams would drive along the Dalton Highway to get close to their field sites. Slamming their car doors, they would unload and hop on snow machines to travel the final distance. Often they would see musk oxen, looking like bison that never cut their hair. The grizzlies were also interested in these oxen, and in the nearby caribou.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the sites they could reach, they took out a corer, a long, tubular piece of equipment driven by a gas engine, meant to drill deep into the ground. Zwieback or a teammate pressed it into the earth. The barrel’s two blades rotated, slicing a cylinder about five feet down to ensure that their samples went deep enough to generate data that can be compared with the measurements made from space. Then they pulled up and extracted the cylinder, a sausage of earth and ice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All day every day for a week, they gathered cores that matched up with the pixels in radar images taken from space. In those cores, the ice was apparent to the eye. But Zwieback didn’t want anecdata. “We want to get a number,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So he and his team would pack their soil cylinders back to the lab. There they sliced them into segments and measured their volume, in both their frozen and their thawed form, to see how well the measured ice content matched estimates from the space-based algorithm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial validation, which took months, demonstrated the value of using satellites for permafrost work. The ice profiles that Zwieback’s algorithm inferred from the satellite data matched measurements in the lab down to about 1.1 feet, and farther in a warm year, with some uncertainty near the surface and deeper into the permafrost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whereas it cost tens of thousands of dollars to fly in on a helicopter, drive in a car, and switch to a snowmobile to ultimately sample a small area using your hands, only to have to continue the work at home, the team needed just a few hundred dollars to run the algorithm on satellite data that was free and publicly available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michaelides, who is familiar with Zwieback’s work, agrees that estimating excess ice content is key to making infrastructural decisions, and that historical methods of sussing it out have been costly in all senses. Zwieback’s method of using late-summer clues to infer what’s going on at that depth “is a very exciting idea,” he says, and the results “demonstrate that there is considerable promise for this approach.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He notes, though, that using space-based radar to understand the thawing ground is complicated: Ground ice content, soil moisture, and vegetation can differ even within a single pixel that a satellite can pick out. “To be clear, this limitation is not unique to Simon's work,” Michaelides says; it affects all space-radar methods. There is also excess ice below even where Zwieback’s algorithm can probe—something the labor-intensive on-ground methods can pick up that still can’t be seen from space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping out the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After Zwieback did his fieldwork, NGA decided to do its own. The agency’s attempt to independently validate his work—in Prudhoe Bay, Utqiagvik, and Fairbanks—was part of a project it called Frostbyte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its partners in that project—the Army’s Cold Regions Research Engineering Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory—declined requests for interviews. As far as Zwieback knows, they’re still analyzing data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the intelligence community isn’t the only group interested in research like Zwieback’s. He also works with Arctic residents, reaching out to rural Alaskan communities where people are trying to make decisions about whether to relocate or where to build safely. “They typically can’t afford to do expensive coring,” he says. “So the idea is to make these data available to them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1124555" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20230503_215840564.MP_.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Zwieback and his team haul their gear out to gather data from drilled core samples, a process which can be arduous  and costly.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ANDREW JOHNSON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schaefer is also trying to bridge the gap between his science and the people it affects. Through a company called Weather Stream, he is helping communities identify risks to infrastructure before anything collapses, so they can take preventative action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making such connections has always been a key concern for Erin Trochim, a geospatial scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As a researcher who works not just on permafrost but also on policy, she’s seen radar science progress massively in recent years—without commensurate advances on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, it’s still hard for residents in her town of Fairbanks—or anywhere—to know if there’s permafrost on their property at all, unless they’re willing to do expensive drilling. She’s encountered this problem, still unsolved, on property she owns. And if an expert can’t figure it out, non-experts hardly stand a chance. “It’s just frustrating when a lot of this information that we know from the science side, and [that’s] trickled through the engineering side, hasn’t really translated into the on-the-ground construction,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a group, though, trying to turn that trickle into a flood: Permafrost Pathways, a venture that launched with a $41 million grant through the TED Audacious Project. In concert with affected communities, including Nunapitchuk, it is building a data-gathering network on the ground, and combining information from that network with satellite data and local knowledge to help understand permafrost thaw and develop adaptation strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think about it often as if you got a diagnosis of a disease,” says Sue Natali, the head of the project. “It’s terrible, but it’s also really great, because when you know what your problem is and what you’re dealing with, it’s only then that you can actually make a plan to address it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the communities Permafrost Pathways works with are making plans. Nunapitchuk has decided to relocate, and the town and the research group have collaboratively surveyed the proposed new location: a higher spot on hardpacked sand. Permafrost Pathways scientists were able to help validate the stability of the new site—and prove to policymakers that this stability would extend into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Radar helps with that in part, Natali says, because unlike other satellite detectors, it penetrates clouds. “In Alaska, it’s extremely cloudy,” she says. “So other data sets have been very, very challenging. Sometimes we get one image per year.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And so radar data, and algorithms like Zwieback’s that help scientists and communities make sense of that data, dig up deeper insight into what’s going on beneath northerners’ feet—and how to step forward on firmer ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Scoles is a freelance science journalist based in southern Colorado and the author, most recently, of the book &lt;/em&gt;Countdown: The Blinding Future of Nuclear Weapons&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/30/1124548/scientists-see-permafrost-thawing-from-space/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The US may be heading toward a drone-filled future (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/30/1124470/the-us-may-be-heading-toward-a-drone-filled-future/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/drones-everywhere-g.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I published a story about the police-tech giant Flock Safety selling its drones to the private sector to track shoplifters. Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now leads Flock’s drone efforts, described the ideal scenario: A security team at a Home Depot, say, launches a drone from the roof that follows shoplifting suspects to their car. The drone tracks their car through the streets, transmitting its live video feed directly to the police.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a vision that, unsurprisingly, alarms civil liberties advocates. They say it will expand the surveillance state created by police drones, license-plate readers, and other crime tech, which has allowed law enforcement to collect massive amounts of private data without warrants.

It’s a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation that stipulates where and how drones can be flown, and it is about to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, you need a waiver from the FAA to fly a drone farther than you can see it. This is meant to protect the public and property from in-air collisions and accidents. In 2018, the FAA began granting these waivers for various scenarios, like search and rescues, insurance inspections, or police investigations. With Flock’s help, police departments can get waivers approved in just two weeks. The company’s private-sector customers generally have to wait 60 to 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For years, industries with a stake in drones—whether e-commerce companies promising doorstep delivery or medical transporters racing to move organs—have pushed the government to scrap the waiver system in favor of easier approval to fly beyond visual line of sight. In June, President Donald Trump echoed that call in an executive order for “American drone dominance,” and in August, the FAA released a new proposed rule.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proposed rule lays out some broad categories for which drone operators are permitted to fly drones beyond their line of sight, including package delivery, agriculture, aerial surveying, and civic interest, which includes policing. Getting approval to fly beyond sight would become easier for operators from these categories, and would generally expand their range.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Drone companies, and amateur drone pilots, see it as a win. But it’s a win that comes at the expense of privacy for the rest of us, says Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project who served on the rule-making commission for the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The FAA is about to open up the skies enormously, to a lot more [beyond visual line of sight] flights without any privacy protections,” he says. The ACLU has said that fleets of drones enable persistent surveillance, including of protests and gatherings, and impinge on the public’s expectations of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got something to say about the FAA’s proposed rule, you can leave a public comment (they’re being accepted until October 6.) Trump’s executive order directs the FAA to release the final rule by spring 2026.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

One sector that using AI with measurable results is agriculture, with vegetable seed companies harnessing the technology to identify the best vegetable varieties out of thousands of options. This facility can help growers in diverse markets who work in very different conditions from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the best vegetable seeds is not just down to yield – growers look for varieties that address unique local climate patterns and growing conditions. The traditional route of variety selection involves several manual processes, including testing and comparing different seed varieties, running field trials, mass data collection, and gathering feedback from growers. Now, seed companies are now turning to AI technology that run alongside traditional selection methods, to analyse such information. This saves time and resources between selection and first crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syngenta Vegetable Seeds and Heritable Agriculture are at the forefront of AI adoption in this sector, and  are collaborating to enhance commercial crop portfolios. Heritable is a new company spun out of the innovation lab at Alphabet (Google’s parent company) that develops AI tools to analyse agricultural data. The two companies combine to create software systems that can recommend which vegetable seed varieties should be offered to which growers and where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using AI tools with Syngenta’s global product portfolio, Heritable relies on crop trialling and existing data on localised geographical conditions to predict the best-performing commercial seed varieties for different regions. The aim is to forecast how well vegetable seed varieties will perform for growers worldwide yet on a micro-level, accurately predicting the best choices down to an accuracy of around 10 metres x 10 metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Johnston, Global Head of Vegetable Seeds and Flowers at Syngenta, said AI has considerable potential in agriculture. “Planting the right seed is important to a grower’s success. New technologies like AI can help us bring the best innovation to the field or greenhouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syngenta has already been using AI in its business, in areas like bio-stimulant and fertiliser development. Recently, the company added an AI chatbot called ‘Cropwise AI‘ to its Cropwise digital platform to help growers make informed decisions about crop choices by analysing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to improve food security and ensure growers around the world can produce food that is affordable, resilient, and reliable.

And Nunapitchuk is far from the only Arctic town to find itself in such a predicament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now scientists think they may be able to use satellite data to delve deep beneath the ground’s surface and get a better understanding of how the permafrost thaws, and which areas might be most severely affected.

In recent years, sewage has leached into the earth. The ground can feel squishy, sodden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small town in northern Alaska is experiencing a sometimes overlooked consequence of climate change: thawing permafrost. And Nunapitchuk is far from the only Arctic town to find itself in such a predicament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now scientists think they may be able to use satellite data to delve deep beneath the ground’s surface and get a better understanding of how the permafrost thaws, and which areas might be most severely affected.

Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now leads Flock’s drone efforts, described the ideal scenario: A security team at a Home Depot, say, launches a drone from the roof that follows shoplifting suspects to their car. The drone tracks their car through the streets, transmitting its live video feed directly to the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a vision that, unsurprisingly, alarms civil liberties advocates. But the fate of drones in the US pretty much comes down to one rule. It’s a Federal Aviation Administration regulation that stipulates where and how drones can be flown&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;and it is about to change.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently all Playground lets you build are widgets, like a flight tracker, a next meeting brief, or a virtual pet, from scratch using text prompts, or customize an existing app on the Essential Apps platform to your purposes. More technical users can modify the code to fine-tune how an app works.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nothing says it is not yet letting developers build full-screen apps, as the technology is not currently mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A nothing phone screen with a screen time monitor and an Art curator widget Image " class="wp-image-3052174" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Essential-Apps-UI-2.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A nothing phone screen with a screen time monitor and an Art curator widget Image Credits: Nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The vibe-coding launch comes mere weeks after Nothing raised $200 million in a round led by Tiger Global. At the time, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said the company wanted to build an operating system with AI-powered features, alongside developing new AI-centric devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a conversation with TechCrunch last week, Pei said smartphone makers are reluctant to change software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Something that has always bothered me is why we aren’t improving software? A lot of people look at what big companies like Apple do, and follow that because that is the safer path. I think software iteration is very slow,” Pei said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With breakthroughs in AI, we believe that operating systems will change and become more personal. Our devices have so much context on us, but that is not being leveraged right now,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, Nothing has so far only launched one AI-enabled app: Essential Space lets users share screenshots, record voice notes, and get transcription for meetings. It’s worth noting that most modern smartphone operating systems today can do all of that and more, and if they can’t, there’s nothing to stop users from simply installing AI apps on their phones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nothing has made a name for itself as a smartphone manufacturer, but it is still a small company compared to the likes of Google, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Apple and Samsung. According to data from analytics firm IDC, the company has less than 1% share of the worldwide smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Pei feels Nothing’s position is advantageous. He has said previously that the company wants to build hardware specifically for using AI, and if it can get it right on smartphones, building hardware with specific use cases would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vibe coding is promising on paper, but so far, apps that have tried to offer similar functionality on smartphones haven’t taken off, per data from analytics firm AppFigures, mostly due to security and maintenance concerns. Pei acknowledged this and said maintaining security while allowing developers to create apps will be crucial going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have millions of users on our devices. So whatever we ship should be easy to use and hard to make a mistake on. That is why, for us, maintaining a level of security with these apps will be important,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the moment, the company isn’t charging for these AI tools, and a paid tier doesn’t seem to be in the works right now.

In sharp contrast, 60 percent are failing to achieve any material value, reporting only minimal gains despite making substantial investments in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is reshaping the business landscape far faster than previous technology waves,” said Nicolas de Bellefonds , a managing director and senior partner and global leader of BCG’s AI efforts, and a coauthor of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The companies that are capturing real value from AI aren’t just automating—they’re reshaping and reinventing how their businesses work. And they’re pulling away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-performing organisations, which BCG labels “future-built,” aren’t just succeeding; they are creating a formidable and widening AI value gap. They already generate 1.7 times more revenue growth and 1.6 times higher EBIT margins than the lagging majority. This elite group has moved beyond isolated experiments to fundamentally reinvent their operations, driving shareholder returns through revenue increases and measurable workflow improvements. The remaining 35 percent of companies are making efforts to scale up but admit they are not moving fast enough to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future-built companies, having reaped early rewards, are now reinvesting their gains to pull even further ahead. They plan to spend 26 percent more on IT and dedicate 64 percent more of their IT budget to AI in 2025. This results in an overall AI investment that is 120 percent higher than their slower competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, future-built companies expect to see double the revenue increases and 1.4 times greater cost reductions from their AI applications. For the laggards, who lack foundational capabilities and generate almost no value, this creates what BCG calls a “vicious cycle of losing ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key reason for this disparity is a failure of leadership. Among lagging firms, top management often delegates AI strategy to middle or lower management, fails to articulate a clear vision for value from investments, and spreads resources too thinly across disconnected initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret to success lies in a proven playbook followed by the leading five percent. These firms approach AI as a board and CEO-sponsored multiyear programme with ambitious, clearly defined targets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all C-level leaders in future-built organisations are deeply engaged with AI, compared to only eight percent in lagging companies. They foster a model of shared ownership between business and IT departments, a practice they are 1.5 times more likely to adopt than their peers. One senior retail executive told BCG they “concentrate in particular on senior sponsorship and ownership of AI benefits by the businesses, which creates the room to invest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These leaders are not merely automating existing processes. They focus on reshaping and inventing core business workflows where the majority of value lies. The report found that 70 percent of AI’s potential value is concentrated in core functions such as R&amp;amp;D, sales, marketing, and manufacturing. Future-built companies prioritise this reinvention, resulting in 62 percent of their AI initiatives already being deployed, compared to just 12 percent for the laggards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accelerator of the value gap is the emergence and investment in agentic AI – which combines predictive and generative capabilities – allowing it to “reason, learn, and act autonomously” with minimal human input. These AI agents can be seen as digital workers, capable of handling complex workflows from supply chain management to customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hardly discussed in 2024, agentic AI already accounts for 17 percent of total AI value in 2025 and is projected to almost double to 29 percent by 2028. The top firms are moving quickly, with a third already using agents, compared to almost none of the laggards. These leaders are prioritising customer experience use cases for agents, with customer service being the top focus for 50 percent of companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Agentic AI isn’t a future concept—it’s already reshaping workflows and redefining roles. Companies should view it as the next step in scaling AI, not as the starting point,” said Amanda Luther , a managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Agents represent a huge opportunity but aren’t simply plug-and-play: companies urgently need to redesign how work gets done, addressing the impact of agents on existing processes, roles, and skills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent is another key differentiator. Rather than focusing on job losses, future-built companies are aggressively upskilling their workforce to collaborate with AI. They plan to upskill more than 50 percent of their internal staff, making investments in broad-based employee AI enablement and carving out dedicated time for structured learning. This approach is six times more likely than in lagging companies. They also involve employees twice as often in the process of co-designing and reshaping workflows to incorporate AI agents, ensuring smoother adoption and building trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading organisations avoid the “GenAI burden” of siloed, unscalable proofs-of-concept by building on a central, integrated AI platform. They are three times more likely to operate such a platform, allowing them to build common capabilities for security and monitoring just once and then reuse them, accelerating deployment and ensuring enterprise-wide scale. More than half of these firms operate on a single, enterprise-wide data model, compared to just four percent of their stagnating peers, giving teams quick access to reliable and governed data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 95 percent of companies falling behind, the message is urgent. The path to success is clearly delineated, but it requires a fundamental shift in mindset and organisation. BCG advises following a “10-20-70 rule,” where transformation efforts should focus 70 percent on people and processes, 20 percent on technology, and only 10 percent on the algorithms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest roadblocks to achieving value from AI investments are not technical but organisational, relating to people, strategy, and processes. As the technology advances and the leaders accelerate, the window for catching up is closing fast. Firms that fail to act decisively now risk being permanently left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung benchmarks real productivity of enterprise AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo from TechEx events." class="wp-image-109669" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

In sharp contrast, 60 percent are failing to achieve any material value, reporting only minimal gains despite making substantial investments in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is reshaping the business landscape far faster than previous technology waves,” said Nicolas de Bellefonds , a managing director and senior partner and global leader of BCG’s AI efforts, and a coauthor of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The companies that are capturing real value from AI aren’t just automating—they’re reshaping and reinventing how their businesses work. And they’re pulling away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-performing organisations, which BCG labels “future-built,” aren’t just succeeding; they are creating a formidable and widening AI value gap. They already generate 1.7 times more revenue growth and 1.6 times higher EBIT margins than the lagging majority. This elite group has moved beyond isolated experiments to fundamentally reinvent their operations, driving shareholder returns through revenue increases and measurable workflow improvements. The remaining 35 percent of companies are making efforts to scale up but admit they are not moving fast enough to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future-built companies, having reaped early rewards, are now reinvesting their gains to pull even further ahead. They plan to spend 26 percent more on IT and dedicate 64 percent more of their IT budget to AI in 2025. This results in an overall AI investment that is 120 percent higher than their slower competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, future-built companies expect to see double the revenue increases and 1.4 times greater cost reductions from their AI applications. For the laggards, who lack foundational capabilities and generate almost no value, this creates what BCG calls a “vicious cycle of losing ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key reason for this disparity is a failure of leadership. Among lagging firms, top management often delegates AI strategy to middle or lower management, fails to articulate a clear vision for value from investments, and spreads resources too thinly across disconnected initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret to success lies in a proven playbook followed by the leading five percent. These firms approach AI as a board and CEO-sponsored multiyear programme with ambitious, clearly defined targets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all C-level leaders in future-built organisations are deeply engaged with AI, compared to only eight percent in lagging companies. They foster a model of shared ownership between business and IT departments, a practice they are 1.5 times more likely to adopt than their peers. One senior retail executive told BCG they “concentrate in particular on senior sponsorship and ownership of AI benefits by the businesses, which creates the room to invest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These leaders are not merely automating existing processes. They focus on reshaping and inventing core business workflows where the majority of value lies. The report found that 70 percent of AI’s potential value is concentrated in core functions such as R&amp;amp;D, sales, marketing, and manufacturing.
