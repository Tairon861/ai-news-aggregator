          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and “making a fool out of him” as an early investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Musk filed a notice on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he’s seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk’s early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit’s current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk’s total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk’s proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk’s current equity stake in xAI, and Musk’s nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye-popping damage claim shocked OpenAI and Microsoft, which could also face punitive damages in a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech giants immediately filed a motion to exclude Wazzan’s opinions, alleging that step was necessary to avoid prejudicing a jury. Their filing claimed that Wazzan’s math seemed “made up,” based on calculations the economics expert testified he’d never used before and allegedly “conjured” just to satisfy Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Wazzan allegedly ignored that Musk left OpenAI after leadership did not agree on how to value Musk’s contributions to the nonprofit. Problematically, Wazzan’s math depends on an imaginary timeline where OpenAI agreed to Musk’s 2017 bid to control 51.2 percent of a new for-profit entity that was then being considered. But that never happened, so it’s unclear why Musk would be owed damages based on a deal that was never struck, OpenAI argues.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Only Musk’s contributions counted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan is “a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience who has managed his own successful venture capital firm that provided seed-level funding to technology startups,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI explained how Musk got connected with Wazzan, who testified that he had never been hired by any of Musk’s companies before. Instead, three months before he submitted his opinions, Wazzan said that Musk’s legal team had reached out to his consulting firm, BRG, and the call was routed to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan’s task was to figure out how much Musk should be owed after investing $38 million in OpenAI—roughly 60 percent of its seed funding. Musk also made nonmonetary contributions Wazzan had to weigh, like “recruiting key employees, introducing business contacts, teaching his cofounders everything he knew about running a successful startup, and lending his prestige and reputation to the venture,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “fact pattern” was “pretty unique,” Wazzan testified, while admitting that his calculations weren’t something you’d find “in a textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Wazzan had to factor in Microsoft’s alleged wrongful gains, by deducing how much of Microsoft’s profits went back into funding the nonprofit. Microsoft alleged Wazzan got this estimate wrong after assuming that “some portion of Microsoft’s stake in the OpenAI for-profit entity should flow back to the OpenAI nonprofit” and arbitrarily decided that the portion must be “equal” to “the nonprofit’s stake in the for-profit entity.” With this odd math, Wazzan double-counted value of the nonprofit and inflated Musk’s damages estimate, Microsoft alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan offers no rationale—contractual, governance, economic, or otherwise—for reallocating any portion of Microsoft’s negotiated interest to the nonprofit,” OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most glaringly, Wazzan reached his opinions without ever weighing the contributions of anyone but Musk, OpenAI alleged. That means that Wazzan’s analysis did not just discount efforts of co-founders and investors like Microsoft, which “invested billions of dollars into OpenAI’s for-profit affiliate in the years after Musk quit.” It also dismissed scientists and programmers who invented ChatGPT as having “contributed zero percent of the nonprofit’s current value,” OpenAI alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to know all the other people,” Wazzan testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk’s legal team contradicted expert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan supposedly also did not bother to quantify Musk’s nonmonetary contributions, which could be in the thousands, millions, or billions based on his vague math, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Musk’s legal team seemed to contradict Wazzan, OpenAI’s filing noted. In Musk’s filing on remedies, it’s acknowledged that the jury may have to adjust the total damages. Because Wazzan does not break down damages by claims and merely assigns the same damages to each individual claim, OpenAI argued it will be impossible for a jury to adjust any of Wazzan’s black box calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face,” OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trial starting in April, Musk will strive to convince a court that such extraordinary damages are owed. OpenAI hopes he’ll fail, in part since “it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits” and “Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk ‘expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan declined to comment. xAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Only Musk’s contributions counted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan is “a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience who has managed his own successful venture capital firm that provided seed-level funding to technology startups,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI explained how Musk got connected with Wazzan, who testified that he had never been hired by any of Musk’s companies before. Instead, three months before he submitted his opinions, Wazzan said that Musk’s legal team had reached out to his consulting firm, BRG, and the call was routed to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan’s task was to figure out how much Musk should be owed after investing $38 million in OpenAI—roughly 60 percent of its seed funding. Musk also made nonmonetary contributions Wazzan had to weigh, like “recruiting key employees, introducing business contacts, teaching his cofounders everything he knew about running a successful startup, and lending his prestige and reputation to the venture,” Musk’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “fact pattern” was “pretty unique,” Wazzan testified, while admitting that his calculations weren’t something you’d find “in a textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Wazzan had to factor in Microsoft’s alleged wrongful gains, by deducing how much of Microsoft’s profits went back into funding the nonprofit. Microsoft alleged Wazzan got this estimate wrong after assuming that “some portion of Microsoft’s stake in the OpenAI for-profit entity should flow back to the OpenAI nonprofit” and arbitrarily decided that the portion must be “equal” to “the nonprofit’s stake in the for-profit entity.” With this odd math, Wazzan double-counted value of the nonprofit and inflated Musk’s damages estimate, Microsoft alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan offers no rationale—contractual, governance, economic, or otherwise—for reallocating any portion of Microsoft’s negotiated interest to the nonprofit,” OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most glaringly, Wazzan reached his opinions without ever weighing the contributions of anyone but Musk, OpenAI alleged. That means that Wazzan’s analysis did not just discount efforts of co-founders and investors like Microsoft, which “invested billions of dollars into OpenAI’s for-profit affiliate in the years after Musk quit.” It also dismissed scientists and programmers who invented ChatGPT as having “contributed zero percent of the nonprofit’s current value,” OpenAI alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to know all the other people,” Wazzan testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Musk’s legal team contradicted expert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan supposedly also did not bother to quantify Musk’s nonmonetary contributions, which could be in the thousands, millions, or billions based on his vague math, OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Musk’s legal team seemed to contradict Wazzan, OpenAI’s filing noted. In Musk’s filing on remedies, it’s acknowledged that the jury may have to adjust the total damages. Because Wazzan does not break down damages by claims and merely assigns the same damages to each individual claim, OpenAI argued it will be impossible for a jury to adjust any of Wazzan’s black box calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face,” OpenAI argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trial starting in April, Musk will strive to convince a court that such extraordinary damages are owed. OpenAI hopes he’ll fail, in part since “it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits” and “Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk ‘expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,” OpenAI’s filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wazzan declined to comment. xAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

		Abstract
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce &lt;strong&gt;Differential Transformer V2&lt;/strong&gt; (DIFF V2), an improved version of Differential Transformer (DIFF V1). This revision focuses on inference efficiency, training stability for production-level LLMs, and architectural elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Inference &amp;amp; No Need of Custom Attention Kernels&lt;/strong&gt;
Instead of forcing the attention parameter count to match the baseline Transformer (as in DIFF V1), we introduce additional parameters (borrowed from other parts of the model) for &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
This design allows DIFF V2 to match the baseline Transformer's decoding speed and directly use FlashAttention without custom kernels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Training Stability&lt;/strong&gt;
We remove the per-head RMSNorm after differential attention. We find the per-head RMSNorm can lead to instability in later stages of large-scale pretraining of LLM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simpler Parameterization &amp;amp; Initialization&lt;/strong&gt;
We replace the globally shared &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a token-specific, head-wise projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. ****This eliminates the exponential re-parameterization and initialization of &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conduct pretraining experiments on production-scale LLMs, including dense models and a 30A3 MoE on trillions of tokens using large learning rate of 6e-4 to 1e-3. Experimental observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably lower language modeling loss&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Transformer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced loss and gradient spikes during training&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly under large learning rate settings where the Transformer baseline becomes unstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced activation outliers magnitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are still running. We expect to explore in later stages of training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If learning efficiency is improved in mid- and post-training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If performance on downstream long-context benchmarks improves (alleviating context rot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the experiments complete and we evaluate the results, we will prepare a more formal report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compare DIFF V2 with DIFF V1 below:&lt;/p&gt;

Heads belonging to the same GQA group are arranged contiguously in the output)&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in DIFF V2 is projected from &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for each token each head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIFF V2 doubles number of query heads while maintaining number of key value heads, and the extra dimension is reduced back to &lt;code&gt;h*d&lt;/code&gt; after the differential operation so the &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; projection remains the same as baseline Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Faster Decoding &amp;amp; No Custom Kernels&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIFF V2 introduces additional query heads compared to the baseline Transformer, &lt;strong&gt;but does not increase the number of key-value (KV) heads&lt;/strong&gt;. Since LLM decoding is typically memory-bound, this design allows DIFF V2 to achieve decoding speeds on par with standard Transformer. &lt;strong&gt;Besides, since head dimension is aligned between query, key and value, there is no need for custom attention kernels for DIFF V2&lt;/strong&gt;. In contrast, DIFF V1 can be slower during decoding because the value cache must be loaded twice, and a custom attention kernel is needed. DIFF V2 can also increase the arithmetic intensity of the attention module during decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During pretraining&lt;/strong&gt;, when using cutting-edge FlashAttention kernels on H-series and B-series GPUs, the throughput reduction introduced by DIFF V2 is negligible. &lt;strong&gt;For long-sequence prefilling&lt;/strong&gt;, we recommend combining DIFF V2 with techniques such as YOCO (also used in Gemma 3n), which already reduces prefilling complexity to linear time with respect to sequence length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An alternative perspective is to compare DIFF V2 with a Transformer that has the same query dimension&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;2h*d&lt;/code&gt;. Under this comparison, both models exhibit same attention kernel speed, while DIFF V2 has less parameters and flops in output projection.&lt;/p&gt;

This means the RMSNorm layer applies a &lt;strong&gt;100x&lt;/strong&gt; magnification to the output. In large-scale pretraining, we find this leads to massive gradients and numerical instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical phenomenon is that when DIFF V1 is pre-trained at a large learning rate, the gradient norm experiences a larger increase compared to Transformer in the later stages, along with higher variance. &lt;strong&gt;In DIFF V2, after removing the per-head RMSNorm, the gradient norm scale becomes comparable to that of Transformer, and the gradient norm spike is reduced&lt;/strong&gt; (will be discussed further below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adopted the per-head RMSNorm design in DIFF V1 primarily because of the doubled value head dimension and the globally shared &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; across all tokens. Given the modifications made to these two aspects in DIFF V2, we found that removing RMSNorm is now safe.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Softmax Constraint &amp;amp; Elimination of Attention Sinks&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate DIFF V2 can overcome the constraint of Softmax mentioned above. It can also help eliminate attention sinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In original Softmax attention:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helps to control the context RMS. We observe that &lt;strong&gt;lowering the lower bound of the context RMS to zero is particularly important&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It can help eliminate attention sinks and improve training stability&lt;/strong&gt;. The upper bound only needs to remain bounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our analysis here consider RMS before output projection &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Although the RMS can be recovered and adjusted after the output projection, the lack of freedom at Softmax still affects the learning performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent works alleviate this constraint as well:&lt;/p&gt;

		Experimental Observations
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conduct pretraining experiments on production-scale LLMs, including dense models and a 30A3 MoE on trillions of tokens using large learning rate of 6e-4 to 1e-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are still running. What we have observed now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably lower language modeling loss&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Transformer (a gap of 0.02 to 0.03).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced loss and gradient spikes during training&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly under large learning rate settings where the Transformer baseline becomes unstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced activation outliers magnitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to explore in later stages of training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning efficiency in mid- and post-training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance on downstream long-context benchmarks (alleviating context rot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;2i+1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; belong to the same GQA group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 1.&lt;/strong&gt; In practice, such a solution is difficult to learn through optimization, as it requires two sets of parameters to converge to exact negatives of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 2.&lt;/strong&gt; The differential operation can be learned by the model and the model chooses to learn it in the training. &lt;strong&gt;Then explicitly constructing it before the output projection as in DIFF V2 can save half of the &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parameters&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of saved parameters is also non-trivial. Under the current GQA setting, the parameters in the attention module are dominated by &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; Therefore, approximately &lt;strong&gt;25% of the attention-module parameters can be saved.&lt;/strong&gt; The saved parameter budget can then be reallocated to other parts of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if DIFF V2, after reallocating parameters, does not achieve a lower loss than the baseline but merely matches it, &lt;strong&gt;the method is still worthwhile if it provides additional benefits&lt;/strong&gt; such as improved training stability, better control of outliers, or higher training efficiency. This is analogous to GQA, which matches the loss of MHA while reducing KV-cache as an additional benefit. So the key question becomes empirical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Subtracting two heads that are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the same GQA group, which means they &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; share the same key and value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For simplicity, we omit the batch dimension and assume that both the input and output of the following &lt;code&gt;flash_attn_func&lt;/code&gt; are three-dimensional tensors &lt;code&gt;(tokens, heads, head dimension)&lt;/code&gt;. Heads belonging to the same GQA group are arranged contiguously in the output)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;

...
attn = flash_attn_func(q, k, v)
nh = attn.size(&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
attn1, attn2 = (attn[:, :nh//&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;], 
                    attn[:, nh//&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;:])
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;

...
attn = flash_attn_func(q, k, v)

attn1, attn2 = (attn[:, &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;], 
                    attn[:, &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;])
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our large learning rate setting, the ablation 1 setting exhibits obvious training instability (much more loss and gradient spikes) and higher loss comparing to DIFF V2. The value should be shared in the two subtraction heads to construct differential operation, as discussed in DIFF V1 paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtracting two attention maps without &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scaling factor, i.e., &lt;code&gt;attn1 - attn2&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;attn1 - lam_val * attn2&lt;/code&gt;. This results in an excessively small context RMS at initialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly using projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without applying &lt;code&gt;sigmoid&lt;/code&gt; operation. The context RMS is unbounded from above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ablation 2 and ablation 3 lead to higher language modeling loss than DIFF V2. Ablation 2 maintains training stability similar to DIFF V2, whereas ablation 3 is less stable (still more stable than ablation 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Miscellaneous
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In DIFF, the outliers in qk logits can be smaller than those in the baseline. This was already analyzed in DIFF V1: DIFF can achieve attention sparsity comparable to the baseline while using smaller qk logits. We further propose that DIFF's differential mechanism, which cancels out small attention values, &lt;strong&gt;may help mitigate the attention rounding error issue discussed in this blog and paper&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIFF V2 is compatible with sparse attention&lt;/strong&gt;. In many existing sparse attention frameworks, query heads within the same GQA group are required to attend to the same key-value blocks in order to maximize speedup. A common strategy is to select key-value blocks based on the average attention logits across heads.
For DIFF V2, the problem shifts to designing an effective block-selection strategy for a larger GQA group that contains pairs of differential heads. This may require handling the two types of differential heads separately during selection, or maybe a simple average of attention logits might already be sufficient in practice. Conceptually, this does not introduce any fundamental differences compared to block sparse attention of standard Transformers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		Abstract
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce &lt;strong&gt;Differential Transformer V2&lt;/strong&gt; (DIFF V2), an improved version of Differential Transformer (DIFF V1). This revision focuses on inference efficiency, training stability for production-level LLMs, and architectural elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Inference &amp;amp; No Need of Custom Attention Kernels&lt;/strong&gt;
Instead of forcing the attention parameter count to match the baseline Transformer (as in DIFF V1), we introduce additional parameters (borrowed from other parts of the model) for &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
This design allows DIFF V2 to match the baseline Transformer's decoding speed and directly use FlashAttention without custom kernels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Training Stability&lt;/strong&gt;
We remove the per-head RMSNorm after differential attention. We find the per-head RMSNorm can lead to instability in later stages of large-scale pretraining of LLM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simpler Parameterization &amp;amp; Initialization&lt;/strong&gt;
We replace the globally shared &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a token-specific, head-wise projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. ****This eliminates the exponential re-parameterization and initialization of &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conduct pretraining experiments on production-scale LLMs, including dense models and a 30A3 MoE on trillions of tokens using large learning rate of 6e-4 to 1e-3. Experimental observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably lower language modeling loss&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Transformer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced loss and gradient spikes during training&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly under large learning rate settings where the Transformer baseline becomes unstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced activation outliers magnitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are still running. We expect to explore in later stages of training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If learning efficiency is improved in mid- and post-training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If performance on downstream long-context benchmarks improves (alleviating context rot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the experiments complete and we evaluate the results, we will prepare a more formal report.&lt;/p&gt;

In the script, &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; represents number of query heads, &lt;code&gt;h_kv&lt;/code&gt;  represents number of key-value heads, and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; means head dimension. The &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in DIFF V2 is projected from &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for each token each head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIFF V2 doubles number of query heads while maintaining number of key value heads, and the extra dimension is reduced back to &lt;code&gt;h*d&lt;/code&gt; after the differential operation so the &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; projection remains the same as baseline Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Faster Decoding &amp;amp; No Custom Kernels&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIFF V2 introduces additional query heads compared to the baseline Transformer, &lt;strong&gt;but does not increase the number of key-value (KV) heads&lt;/strong&gt;. Since LLM decoding is typically memory-bound, this design allows DIFF V2 to achieve decoding speeds on par with standard Transformer. &lt;strong&gt;Besides, since head dimension is aligned between query, key and value, there is no need for custom attention kernels for DIFF V2&lt;/strong&gt;. In contrast, DIFF V1 can be slower during decoding because the value cache must be loaded twice, and a custom attention kernel is needed. DIFF V2 can also increase the arithmetic intensity of the attention module during decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During pretraining&lt;/strong&gt;, when using cutting-edge FlashAttention kernels on H-series and B-series GPUs, the throughput reduction introduced by DIFF V2 is negligible. &lt;strong&gt;For long-sequence prefilling&lt;/strong&gt;, we recommend combining DIFF V2 with techniques such as YOCO (also used in Gemma 3n), which already reduces prefilling complexity to linear time with respect to sequence length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An alternative perspective is to compare DIFF V2 with a Transformer that has the same query dimension&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;2h*d&lt;/code&gt;. Under this comparison, both models exhibit same attention kernel speed, while DIFF V2 has less parameters and flops in output projection.&lt;/p&gt;

This means the RMSNorm layer applies a &lt;strong&gt;100x&lt;/strong&gt; magnification to the output. In large-scale pretraining, we find this leads to massive gradients and numerical instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical phenomenon is that when DIFF V1 is pre-trained at a large learning rate, the gradient norm experiences a larger increase compared to Transformer in the later stages, along with higher variance. &lt;strong&gt;In DIFF V2, after removing the per-head RMSNorm, the gradient norm scale becomes comparable to that of Transformer, and the gradient norm spike is reduced&lt;/strong&gt; (will be discussed further below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adopted the per-head RMSNorm design in DIFF V1 primarily because of the doubled value head dimension and the globally shared &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; across all tokens. Given the modifications made to these two aspects in DIFF V2, we found that removing RMSNorm is now safe.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Softmax Constraint &amp;amp; Elimination of Attention Sinks&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate DIFF V2 can overcome the constraint of Softmax mentioned above. It can also help eliminate attention sinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In original Softmax attention:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helps to control the context RMS. We observe that &lt;strong&gt;lowering the lower bound of the context RMS to zero is particularly important&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It can help eliminate attention sinks and improve training stability&lt;/strong&gt;. The upper bound only needs to remain bounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our analysis here consider RMS before output projection &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Although the RMS can be recovered and adjusted after the output projection, the lack of freedom at Softmax still affects the learning performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent works alleviate this constraint as well:&lt;/p&gt;

		Experimental Observations
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conduct pretraining experiments on production-scale LLMs, including dense models and a 30A3 MoE on trillions of tokens using large learning rate of 6e-4 to 1e-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments are still running. What we have observed now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably lower language modeling loss&lt;/strong&gt; compared to Transformer (a gap of 0.02 to 0.03).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced loss and gradient spikes during training&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly under large learning rate settings where the Transformer baseline becomes unstable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced activation outliers magnitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to explore in later stages of training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning efficiency in mid- and post-training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance on downstream long-context benchmarks (alleviating context rot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 1.&lt;/strong&gt; In practice, such a solution is difficult to learn through optimization, as it requires two sets of parameters to converge to exact negatives of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 2.&lt;/strong&gt; The differential operation can be learned by the model and the model chooses to learn it in the training. &lt;strong&gt;Then explicitly constructing it before the output projection as in DIFF V2 can save half of the &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parameters&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of saved parameters is also non-trivial. Under the current GQA setting, the parameters in the attention module are dominated by &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;O&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;W_O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; Therefore, approximately &lt;strong&gt;25% of the attention-module parameters can be saved.&lt;/strong&gt; The saved parameter budget can then be reallocated to other parts of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if DIFF V2, after reallocating parameters, does not achieve a lower loss than the baseline but merely matches it, &lt;strong&gt;the method is still worthwhile if it provides additional benefits&lt;/strong&gt; such as improved training stability, better control of outliers, or higher training efficiency. This is analogous to GQA, which matches the loss of MHA while reducing KV-cache as an additional benefit. So the key question becomes empirical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

                    attn[:, &lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;])
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our large learning rate setting, the ablation 1 setting exhibits obvious training instability (much more loss and gradient spikes) and higher loss comparing to DIFF V2. The value should be shared in the two subtraction heads to construct differential operation, as discussed in DIFF V1 paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtracting two attention maps without &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scaling factor, i.e., &lt;code&gt;attn1 - attn2&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;attn1 - lam_val * attn2&lt;/code&gt;. This results in an excessively small context RMS at initialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly using projected &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without applying &lt;code&gt;sigmoid&lt;/code&gt; operation. The context RMS is unbounded from above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ablation 2 and ablation 3 lead to higher language modeling loss than DIFF V2. Ablation 2 maintains training stability similar to DIFF V2, whereas ablation 3 is less stable (still more stable than ablation 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In DIFF, the outliers in qk logits can be smaller than those in the baseline. This was already analyzed in DIFF V1: DIFF can achieve attention sparsity comparable to the baseline while using smaller qk logits. We further propose that DIFF's differential mechanism, which cancels out small attention values, &lt;strong&gt;may help mitigate the attention rounding error issue discussed in this blog and paper&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIFF V2 is compatible with sparse attention&lt;/strong&gt;. In many existing sparse attention frameworks, query heads within the same GQA group are required to attend to the same key-value blocks in order to maximize speedup. A common strategy is to select key-value blocks based on the average attention logits across heads.
For DIFF V2, the problem shifts to designing an effective block-selection strategy for a larger GQA group that contains pairs of differential heads. This may require handling the two types of differential heads separately during selection, or maybe a simple average of attention logits might already be sufficient in practice. Conceptually, this does not introduce any fundamental differences compared to block sparse attention of standard Transformers.&lt;/li&gt;
