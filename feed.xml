Some immediately declared it the app platform of the future — predicting a ChatGPT-powered world where Apple’s App Store becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;An open question was answered today – "what will the AI-native distribution channel be?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like ChatGPT will be that channel with 800M active users + the Apps SDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely as important as Steve Jobs announcing the app store in March of 2008 … pic.twitter.com/6RCbIi0foq&lt;/p&gt;— Anish Acharya (@illscience) October 7, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But while OpenAI’s app platform presents an emerging threat, Apple’s vision for an improved Siri — though still seriously delayed — could still play out in its favor. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After all, Apple already controls the hardware, the operating system, and has roughly 1.5 billion iPhone users globally, compared to ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly active users. If Apple’s bet pays off, it could position the iPhone maker in a way that would not only maintain its app industry dominance but also modernize how we use apps in the AI era. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s plan is to kill the app icon without killing the app itself. Its vision for AI-powered computing — introduced at its developer conference last year — would see iPhone users interact with an overhauled version of Siri and a revamped system that changes the way you use apps on your phone. (Imagine less tapping and more talking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apps-are-passe-long-live-apps"&gt;Apps are passé, long live apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s an idea whose time has come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Organizing little tappable icons on your iPhone’s Home Screen to make online information more accessible is a dated metaphor for computing. Meant to resemble a scaled-down version of a computer’s desktop, apps are becoming a less common way for users to interact with many of their preferred online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These days, consumers are just as likely to ask an AI assistant for a recommendation or insight as they are to do a Google search or launch a dedicated, single-purpose app, like Yelp. They’ll talk out loud to their smart speakers or Bluetooth-connected AirPods to play their favorite tunes; they’ll ask a chatbot for business information or a summary of reviews for a new movie or show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI, a large language model trained on web-scraped data and more, determines what the user wants to know and spits out a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is arguably easier than scouring through Google’s search results for the right link with the answer. (That’s something Google itself realized over a decade ago, when it started putting answers to user queries right on the search results page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI is also often easier than finding the right app on your now overcrowded iPhone, launching it, and then interacting with its user interface — which varies from app to app — to perform your task or get an answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056248" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iphone-app-library-GettyImages1756853433.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;NurPhoto / Contributor &lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;(opens in a new window)&lt;/span&gt; / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, ChatGPT’s app system, while seemingly improving on this model, remains locked inside the ChatGPT user experience. It requires consumers to engage in a chatbot-style interface to use their apps, which could require user education. To call up an app, you have to name it as the first word of your prompt or otherwise mention the app by name to get a button that prompts you to “use the app for the answer.” Then, you have to type in an accurate query. (If you mess this up, early tests by Bloomberg indicate you could get stuck on a loading screen with no results!)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We have to wonder: is this the future of apps, or just the future while there’s no other competition? When another solution becomes available — one that’s built into your iPhone, no less — will consumers keep using ChatGPT, or are they still willing to give Siri another try? We don’t know, but we wouldn’t count out Apple yet, even though Siri has quite a bad reputation to salvage at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Siri may be an embarrassment as it stands today, but Apple’s overall ecosystem has advantages. For starters, consumers &lt;em&gt;already have&lt;/em&gt; the apps they want to use on their phone or know how to find them on the App Store, if not. They’ve used many of these apps for years. Muscle memory goes a long way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, there are a few roadblocks to getting started with ChatGPT’s app platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056483" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2641.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You have to install the app in question, of course; then you have to connect the app to ChatGPT by jumping through a warning-filled permission screen. This process requires you to authenticate with the app using your existing username and password, and to enter the two-factor authentication code, if applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After this one-time setup, things should be easier. For instance, after you generate a Spotify playlist with AI, it can be launched in the Spotify app with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, this experience won’t differ much from Apple’s plans if Apple is able to make things work as promised. Apple says you’ll be able to talk or text Siri to control your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3056249" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-5.24.02PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are other disadvantages to the OpenAI app model. You can only interact with one app at a time, instead of being able to switch back and forth between apps — something that could be useful when comparing prices or trying to decide between a hotel room and an Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using apps within ChatGPT also strips away the branding, design, and identity that consumers associate with their favorite apps. (For those who hate how cluttered Spotify’s app has become, perhaps that’s a good thing. Others, however, will disagree.) And, in some cases, using the mobile app version to accomplish your goals may still be easier than using the ChatGPT app version because of the flexibility the former offers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, compelling users to switch app platforms could be difficult when there isn’t an obvious advantage to using apps within ChatGPT — except for the fact that it’s neat that you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-apple-save-siri-s-reputation-with-ai-features"&gt;Can Apple save Siri’s reputation with AI features? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its WWDC 2024 demonstration — which Apple swears was not “demoware” — the company showed how the apps would function under this new system and how they could use other AI features like proofreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most importantly, Apple told developers that they’ll be able to take advantage of some of its AI capabilities without having to do additional work — like a note-taking app using proofreading or rewriting tools. Plus, developers who have already integrated SiriKit into their apps will be able to do more in terms of having users take action in their apps. (SiriKit, a toolkit for making apps interoperable with Siri and Apple’s Shortcuts, is something developers have been using since iOS 10.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These developers will see immediate enhancements when the new Siri rolls out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2792502" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-01-e1718052065212.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple said it will focus on categories like Notes, Media, Messaging, Payments, Restaurant Reservations, VoIP Calling, and Workouts, to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apps in these categories will be able to let their users take actions via Siri. In practice, that means Siri will be able to invoke any item from an app’s menus. For example, you could ask Siri to see your presenter notes in a slide deck, and your productivity app would respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The apps would also be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple’s standard text systems. That could make the app interactions feel more natural, without the user having to give specifically worded prompts or commands. For instance, if you had a reminder to wish your grandpa a happy birthday, you could say “FaceTime him” to take that action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2792501" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-02.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s existing Intents framework is also being updated to gain access to Apple Intelligence, covering even more apps in categories like Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards, and Word Processors. Here, Apple is creating new “Intents” that are pre-defined, trained, and tested, and making them available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means you could tell the photo-editing app Darkroom to apply a cinematic filter to an image via Siri. Plus, Siri will be able to suggest an app’s actions, helping iPhone users discover what their apps can do and take those actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers have been adopting the App Intents framework, introduced in iOS 16, because it offers other functionality to integrate their app’s actions and content with other platform features, including Spotlight, Siri, the iPhone’s Action button, widgets, controls, and visual search features — not just Apple Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2851355" height="385" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo-edits-via-AI-siri.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, unlike ChatGPT, Apple runs its own operating system on its own hardware and offers the App Store as a discovery mechanism, the app infrastructure, and developer tools, APIs, and frameworks — not just the AI-powered interface that will help you use your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Apple may have to borrow some AI tech from others to do that last bit, it has the data to personalize your app recommendations, and, for the privacy-minded, the controls that let you limit how much information apps themselves can collect. (Where’s the “Do Not Track” option for ChatGPT’s app system, we wonder?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s system doesn’t work out of the box with all your apps at launch. It requires developer adoption and relies on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a newer technology for connecting AI assistants to other systems. That’s why ChatGPT currently works with only a handful of apps, like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. MCP adoption is growing, but the delay in its becoming broadly adopted could give Apple the extra time it needs to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more, word is that Apple’s AI system is nearly ready. The company is reportedly already internally testing this, allowing users to take actions in apps by using Siri voice commands. Bloomberg reported that this smarter version of Siri works out of the box works with many apps, including those from major players like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp. And it’s still on track to ship next year, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-has-an-iphone-openai-has-jony-ive"&gt;Apple has an iPhone, OpenAI has Jony Ive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iPhone’s status as an app platform will also be difficult to disrupt, even from a company as large and powerful as OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT maker understands this, too, which is why OpenAI is exploring its own device with Apple’s former head of design, Jony Ive. It wants its AI to become more of a part of consumers’ everyday lives and habits, which could require a hardware device. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, so far, the company has struggled to think up a better computing paradigm than the smartphone, reports indicate. At the same time, the general public has demonstrated an aversion to always-on AI devices, which bump up against existing social norms and threaten privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI backlash has covered AI device maker Friend’s NYC subway posters, led Taylor Swift fans to attack their idol for dabbling in AI, and threatened the reputation of popular consumer brands and enterprise businesses alike. That leaves the future success of an OpenAI device in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, that means OpenAI’s app model is one that essentially boils down to using its app to control other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Apple gets its Siri upgrade right, that intermediary may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This week, OpenAI announced that apps can now run directly inside ChatGPT, letting users book travel, create playlists, and edit designs without switching between different apps.

For example, you could ask Siri to see your presenter notes in a slide deck, and your productivity app would respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The apps would also be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple’s standard text systems. That could make the app interactions feel more natural, without the user having to give specifically worded prompts or commands. For instance, if you had a reminder to wish your grandpa a happy birthday, you could say “FaceTime him” to take that action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2792501" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-02.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s existing Intents framework is also being updated to gain access to Apple Intelligence, covering even more apps in categories like Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards, and Word Processors. Here, Apple is creating new “Intents” that are pre-defined, trained, and tested, and making them available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means you could tell the photo-editing app Darkroom to apply a cinematic filter to an image via Siri. Plus, Siri will be able to suggest an app’s actions, helping iPhone users discover what their apps can do and take those actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers have been adopting the App Intents framework, introduced in iOS 16, because it offers other functionality to integrate their app’s actions and content with other platform features, including Spotlight, Siri, the iPhone’s Action button, widgets, controls, and visual search features — not just Apple Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2851355" height="385" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo-edits-via-AI-siri.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, unlike ChatGPT, Apple runs its own operating system on its own hardware and offers the App Store as a discovery mechanism, the app infrastructure, and developer tools, APIs, and frameworks — not just the AI-powered interface that will help you use your apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Apple may have to borrow some AI tech from others to do that last bit, it has the data to personalize your app recommendations, and, for the privacy-minded, the controls that let you limit how much information apps themselves can collect. (Where’s the “Do Not Track” option for ChatGPT’s app system, we wonder?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s system doesn’t work out of the box with all your apps at launch. It requires developer adoption and relies on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a newer technology for connecting AI assistants to other systems. That’s why ChatGPT currently works with only a handful of apps, like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. MCP adoption is growing, but the delay in its becoming broadly adopted could give Apple the extra time it needs to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more, word is that Apple’s AI system is nearly ready. The company is reportedly already internally testing this, allowing users to take actions in apps by using Siri voice commands. Bloomberg reported that this smarter version of Siri works out of the box works with many apps, including those from major players like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp. And it’s still on track to ship next year, Apple confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-has-an-iphone-openai-has-jony-ive"&gt;Apple has an iPhone, OpenAI has Jony Ive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iPhone’s status as an app platform will also be difficult to disrupt, even from a company as large and powerful as OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT maker understands this, too, which is why OpenAI is exploring its own device with Apple’s former head of design, Jony Ive. It wants its AI to become more of a part of consumers’ everyday lives and habits, which could require a hardware device. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, so far, the company has struggled to think up a better computing paradigm than the smartphone, reports indicate. At the same time, the general public has demonstrated an aversion to always-on AI devices, which bump up against existing social norms and threaten privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI backlash has covered AI device maker Friend’s NYC subway posters, led Taylor Swift fans to attack their idol for dabbling in AI, and threatened the reputation of popular consumer brands and enterprise businesses alike. That leaves the future success of an OpenAI device in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, that means OpenAI’s app model is one that essentially boils down to using its app to control other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Apple gets its Siri upgrade right, that intermediary may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/its-not-too-late-for-apple-to-get-ai-right/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ready or not, enterprises are betting on AI (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/ready-or-not-enterprises-are-betting-on-ai/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ai-avatar-simpleshow-2154151760.jpg?resize=1200,826" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-megaphone wp-block-embed-megaphone"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This has been a big week for AI companies signing enterprise deals, with Zendesk unveiling new AI agents that are supposed to be able to resolve 80% of customer service issues, Anthropic and IBM announcing a strategic partnership, and Deloitte also announcing a deal with Anthropic. Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony: &lt;/strong&gt;I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirsten:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ve actually written about it a few times. There are a bunch of different startups that are developing full customer service suites, voice agents, LLMs for emails and texts [from] dealerships and service centers. I actually think that’s a worthy idea, because the problem there isn’t: We don’t have enough people for the jobs to do this stuff and it’s going to take their jobs away. It’s that you can never get somebody on the phone or you get bounced around.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Especially going for service, you get bounced to the service department. Everybody’s busy. So if you can capture it accurately and make it easier for people to get a response, the question there for me is how much will those businesses adopt it and stick with it. There’s been all sorts of technologies over the years, like web forms and things like that, where these dealerships have done it, but then they forget about it. And then it just sits on their website and you think that it’s going to work, and then it doesn’t work, because they just want you to call them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So I have some optimism and some hope that stuff like this is actually gonna be people’s first touch point with [a business]. And it looks like we’re about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

(AI | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-vibe-coding-ruining-a-generation-of-engineers</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;AI tools are revolutionizing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/replacing-coders-with-ai-why-bill-gates-sam-altman-and-experience-say-you"&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt; by automating repetitive tasks, refactoring bloated code, and identifying bugs in real-time. Developers can now generate well-structured code from plain language prompts, saving hours of manual effort. These tools learn from vast codebases, offering context-aware recommendations that enhance productivity and reduce errors. Rather than starting from scratch, engineers can prototype quickly, iterate faster and focus on solving increasingly complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As code generation tools grow in popularity, they raise questions about the future size and structure of engineering teams. Earlier this year, Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, noted that about one-quarter of its current clients use AI to write 95% or more of their software.&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/y-combinator-startups-are-fastest-growing-in-fund-history-because-of-ai.html"&gt; &lt;u&gt;In an interview with CNBC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tan said: “What that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers, you don’t have to raise as much. The capital goes much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI-powered coding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may offer a fast solution for businesses under budget pressure — but its long-term effects on the field and labor pool cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;As AI-powered coding rises, human expertise may diminish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that"&gt;era of AI&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-can-now-process-entire-software-projects-in-single-request-anthropic-says"&gt;Anthropic’s Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-retires-autogen-and-debuts-agent-framework-to-unify-and-govern"&gt;AutoGen and Semantic Kernel&lt;/a&gt; — to support the development of agentic AI systems. AutoGen enables asynchronous messaging, modular components, and distributed agent collaboration to build complex workflows with minimal human input. Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates LLMs with languages like C#, Python and Java, letting developers build AI agents to automate tasks and manage enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing availability of these tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and others may reduce opportunities for coders to refine and deepen their skills. Rather than “banging their heads against the wall” to debug a few lines or select a library to unlock new features, junior developers may simply turn to AI for an assist. This means senior coders with problem-solving skills honed over decades may become an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overreliance on AI for writing code risks weakening developers’ hands-on experience and understanding of key programming concepts. Without regular practice, they may struggle to independently debug, optimize or design systems. Ultimately, this erosion of skill can undermine critical thinking, creativity and adaptability — qualities that are essential not just for coding, but for assessing the quality and logic of AI-generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI as mentor: Turning code automation into hands-on learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns about AI diminishing human developer skills are valid, businesses shouldn’t dismiss AI-supported coding. They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When u&lt;!-- --&gt;sed as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront. By observing how AI builds and refines code, junior developers who actively engage with these tools can internalize patterns, architectural decisions and debugging strategies — mirroring the traditional learning process of trial and error, code reviews and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, AI coding assistants shouldn’t replace real mentorship or pair programming. Pull requests and formal code reviews remain essential for guiding newer, less experienced team members. We are nowhere near the point at which AI can single-handedly upskill a junior developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies and educators can build structured development programs around these tools that emphasize code comprehension to ensure AI is used as a training partner rather than a crutch. This encourages coders to question AI outputs and requires manual refactoring exercises. In this way, AI becomes less of a replacement for human ingenuity and more of a catalyst for accelerated, experiential learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bridging the gap between automation and education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When utilized with intention, AI doesn’t just write code; it teaches coding, blending automation with education to prepare developers for a future where deep understanding and adaptability remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By embracing AI as a mentor, as a programming partner and as a team of developers we can direct to the problem at hand, we can bridge the gap between effective automation and education. We can empower developers to grow alongside the tools they use. We can ensure that, as AI evolves, so too does the human skill set, fostering a generation of coders who are both efficient and deeply knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard Sonnenblick is chief data scientist at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.planview.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;AI tools are revolutionizing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/replacing-coders-with-ai-why-bill-gates-sam-altman-and-experience-say-you"&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt; by automating repetitive tasks, refactoring bloated code, and identifying bugs in real-time.

&lt;/b&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that"&gt;era of AI&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-can-now-process-entire-software-projects-in-single-request-anthropic-says"&gt;Anthropic’s Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-retires-autogen-and-debuts-agent-framework-to-unify-and-govern"&gt;AutoGen and Semantic Kernel&lt;/a&gt; — to support the development of agentic AI systems. AutoGen enables asynchronous messaging, modular components, and distributed agent collaboration to build complex workflows with minimal human input. Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates LLMs with languages like C#, Python and Java, letting developers build AI agents to automate tasks and manage enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing availability of these tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and others may reduce opportunities for coders to refine and deepen their skills. Rather than “banging their heads against the wall” to debug a few lines or select a library to unlock new features, junior developers may simply turn to AI for an assist. This means senior coders with problem-solving skills honed over decades may become an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overreliance on AI for writing code risks weakening developers’ hands-on experience and understanding of key programming concepts. Without regular practice, they may struggle to independently debug, optimize or design systems. Ultimately, this erosion of skill can undermine critical thinking, creativity and adaptability — qualities that are essential not just for coding, but for assessing the quality and logic of AI-generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI as mentor: Turning code automation into hands-on learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns about AI diminishing human developer skills are valid, businesses shouldn’t dismiss AI-supported coding. They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When u&lt;!-- --&gt;sed as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront. By observing how AI builds and refines code, junior developers who actively engage with these tools can internalize patterns, architectural decisions and debugging strategies — mirroring the traditional learning process of trial and error, code reviews and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, AI coding assistants shouldn’t replace real mentorship or pair programming. Pull requests and formal code reviews remain essential for guiding newer, less experienced team members. We are nowhere near the point at which AI can single-handedly upskill a junior developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies and educators can build structured development programs around these tools that emphasize code comprehension to ensure AI is used as a training partner rather than a crutch. This encourages coders to question AI outputs and requires manual refactoring exercises. In this way, AI becomes less of a replacement for human ingenuity and more of a catalyst for accelerated, experiential learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bridging the gap between automation and education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When utilized with intention, AI doesn’t just write code; it teaches coding, blending automation with education to prepare developers for a future where deep understanding and adaptability remain indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By embracing AI as a mentor, as a programming partner and as a team of developers we can direct to the problem at hand, we can bridge the gap between effective automation and education. We can empower developers to grow alongside the tools they use. We can ensure that, as AI evolves, so too does the human skill set, fostering a generation of coders who are both efficient and deeply knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Richard Sonnenblick is chief data scientist at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.planview.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-vibe-coding-ruining-a-generation-of-engineers</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Andrew Tulloch heads to Meta (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/thinking-machines-lab-co-founder-andrew-tulloch-heads-to-meta/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2173579488.jpg?resize=1200,799" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost one of its co-founders to Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Wall Street Journal reports that AI researcher Andrew Tulloch announced his departure to employees in a message on Friday. A Thinking Machine Labs spokesperson confirmed Tulloch’s departure to the WSJ, saying he “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back in August, the WSJ reported that Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive AI recruiting blitz included an offer to acquire Thinking Machines Lab — and when that failed, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to lure Tulloch with a compensation package that could have been worth up to $1.5 billion over at least six years. (At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that the WSJ’s description of the offer was “inaccurate and ridiculous.”)&lt;/p&gt;
