It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on building other state- or county-specific models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Elder says, Securus has been piloting the AI tools to monitor inmate conversations in real time (the company declined to specify where this is taking place, but its customers include jails holding people awaiting trial, prisons for those serving sentences, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can point that large language model at an entire treasure trove [of data],” Elder says, “to detect and understand when crimes are being thought about or contemplated, so that you’re catching it much earlier in the cycle.” &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As with its other monitoring tools, investigators at detention facilities can deploy the AI features to monitor randomly selected conversations or those of individuals suspected by facility investigators of criminal activity, according to Elder. The model will analyze phone and video calls, text messages, and emails and then flag sections for human agents to review. These agents then send them to investigators for follow-up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an interview, Elder said Securus’ monitoring efforts have helped disrupt human trafficking and gang activities organized from within prisons, among other crimes, and said its tools are also used to identify prison staff who are bringing in contraband. But the company did not provide &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; with any cases specifically uncovered by its new AI models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;People in prison, and those they call, are notified that their conversations are recorded. But this doesn’t mean they’re aware that those conversations could be used to train an AI model, says Bianca Tylek, executive director of the prison rights advocacy group Worth Rises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s coercive consent; there’s literally no other way you can communicate with your family,” Tylek says. And since inmates in the vast majority of states pay for these calls, she adds, “not only are you not compensating them for the use of their data, but you’re actually charging them while collecting their data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A company spokesperson said that correctional facilities determine their own recording and monitoring policies, which Securus follows, and did not directly answer whether inmates can opt out of having their recordings used to train AI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other advocates for inmates say Securus has a history of violating their civil liberties. For example, leaks of its recordings databases showed the company had improperly recorded thousands of calls between inmates and their attorneys. Corene Kendrick, the deputy director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project, says that the new AI system enables a system of invasive surveillance, and courts have specified few limits to this power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Are we] going to stop crime before it happens because we’re monitoring every utterance and thought of incarcerated people?” Kendrick says. “I think this is one of many situations where the technology is way far ahead of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Secrurus spokesperson said the tool "is not focused on surveilling or targeting specific individuals, but rather on identifying broader patterns, anomalies, and unlawful behaviors across the entire communication system." They added that its function is to make monitoring more efficient amid staffing shortages, “not to surveil individuals without cause.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Securus will have an easier time funding its AI tool thanks to the company’s recent win in a battle with regulators over how telecom companies can spend the money they collect from inmates’ calls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, the Federal Communications Commission issued a major reform, shaped and lauded by advocates for prisoners’ rights, that forbade telecoms from passing the costs of recording and surveilling calls on to inmates. Companies were allowed to continue to charge inmates a capped rate for calls, but prisons and jails were ordered to pay for most security costs out of their own budgets.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Negative reactions to this change were swift. Associations of sheriffs (who typically run county jails) complained they could no longer afford proper monitoring of calls, and attorneys general from 14 states sued over the ruling. Some prisons and jails warned they would cut off access to phone calls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it was building and piloting its AI tool, Securus held meetings with the FCC and lobbied for a rule change, arguing that the 2024 reform went too far and asking that the agency again allow companies to use fees collected from inmates to pay for security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June, Brendan Carr, whom President Donald Trump appointed to lead the FCC, said it would postpone all deadlines for jails and prisons to adopt the 2024 reforms, and even signaled that the agency wants to help telecom companies fund their AI surveillance efforts with the fees paid by inmates. In a press release, Carr wrote that rolling back the 2024 reforms would “lead to broader adoption of beneficial public safety tools that include advanced AI and machine learning.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On October 28, the agency went further: It voted to pass new, higher rate caps and allow companies like Securus to pass security costs relating to recording and monitoring of calls—like storing recordings, transcribing them, or building AI tools to analyze such calls, for example—on to inmates.&amp;nbsp;A spokesperson for Securus told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the company aims to balance affordability with the need to fund essential safety and security tools. “These tools, which include our advanced monitoring and AI capabilities, are fundamental to maintaining secure facilities for incarcerated individuals and correctional staff and to protecting the public,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FCC commissioner Anna Gomez dissented in last month’s ruling. “Law enforcement,” she wrote in a statement, “should foot the bill for unrelated security and safety costs, not the families of incarcerated people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FCC will be seeking comment on these new rules before they take final effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prison-phone-wire.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A US telecom company trained an AI model on years of inmates’ phone and video calls and is now piloting that model to scan their calls, texts, and emails in the hope of predicting and preventing crimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Securus Technologies president Kevin Elder told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;that the company began building its AI tools in 2023, using its massive database of recorded calls to train AI models to detect criminal activity.

This annual list recognizes 35 of the world’s best young scientists and inventors, and our newsroom has produced it for more than two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s free to nominate yourself or someone you know, and it only takes a few moments. &lt;strong&gt;Submit your nomination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; before 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday, January 20, 2026.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who are making important scientific discoveries and applying that knowledge to build new technologies. Or those who are engineering new systems and algorithms that will aid our work or extend our abilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each year, many honorees are focused on improving human health or solving major problems like climate change; others are charting the future path of artificial intelligence or developing the next generation of robots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The most successful candidates will have made a clear advance that is expected to have a positive impact beyond their own field. They should be the primary scientific or technical driver behind the work involved, and we like to see some signs that a candidate’s innovation is gaining real traction. You can look at last year’s list to get an idea of what we look out for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We encourage self-nominations, and if you previously nominated someone who wasn’t selected, feel free to put them forward again. &lt;strong&gt;Please note: To be eligible for the 2026 list, nominees must be under the age of 35 as of October 1, 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Semifinalists will be notified by early March and asked to complete an application at that time.
