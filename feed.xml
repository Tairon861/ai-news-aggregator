The chip will be based on the company’s latest Blackwell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, US President Donald Trump suggested that more advanced Nvidia chips might eventually be sold in China. But approval is uncertain, as US officials remain wary of giving Beijing too much access to American AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new chip, referred to internally as the B30A, is expected to use a single-die design. That means all the core parts of the chip are built on one piece of silicon, instead of split in two dies like in Nvidia’s flagship B300. People familiar with the details said this would likely give the B30A about half the power of the B300, but still make it stronger than the H20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the H20, the B30A will feature high-bandwidth memory and NVLink, Nvidia’s technology for moving data quickly between processors. Final specifications haven’t been locked in, but the company hopes to send samples to Chinese customers for testing as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, in a statement about its strategy for China, said: “We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow. Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been pushing for approval. “Of course he would like to sell a new chip to China,” Lutnick said, adding that Huang often pitches the idea directly to the president. “The president listens to our great technology companies, and he’ll decide how he wants to play it. But the fact Jensen is pitching a new chip shouldn’t surprise anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;US-China trade tensions grow over Nvidia chips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of how much access China should have to advanced AI chips has become one of the main points of tension between Washington and Beijing. China accounted for 13% of Nvidia’s revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia only resumed selling the H20 in July after US regulators abruptly halted sales in April. The H20 was designed in 2023 to meet export rules which restricted chip sales to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump said recently he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its next-generation chip in China. As part of a broader deal, Nvidia and rival AMD agreed to give the US government 15% of revenue from some chip sales to China. Trump also called the H20 “obsolete,” suggesting that a new China-only chip could deliver “30% to 50% off” [sic] the computing power of the top model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipartisan Washington legislators argue even weaker versions of AI chips could still give China an edge in critical areas. Nvidia and others have countered, saying if they stop selling to China, customers will turn to local suppliers like Huawei. The latter’s most recent chip models are said to rival Nvidia’s in raw computing power, though analysts say Huawei still trails in software performance and memory speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s state media has added more pressure by warning that Nvidia’s chips could carry security risks, with regulators cautioning Chinese firms against buying the H20. Nvidia has denied that its hardware poses any such threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Another chip in the works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the B30A, Nvidia is preparing another product specifically for the Chinese market, also built on the Blackwell architecture but focused on AI inference tasks. According to sources, the RTX6000D chip will be cheaper than the H20 due to simpler design and lower specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the RTX6000D is designed to perform at just under thresholds set by US export strictures. It uses standard GDDR memory and runs at 1,398 gigabytes per second – slightly below the 1.4 terabyte-per-second cap set by new restrictions in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small shipments of the RTX6000D are expected to reach Chinese customers in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by BoliviaInteligente)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: NVIDIA aims to solve AI’s issues with many languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

According to a 2024 UN report, the building sector has fallen “significantly behind on progress” toward becoming more sustainable. Changing the way we erect and operate buildings remains key to even approaching climate goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As soon as you set out and do something differently in construction, you are constantly bumping your head against the wall,” says Paloma Gormley, a director of the London-based design and research nonprofit Material Cultures. “You can either stop there or take a step back and try to find a way around it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gormley has been finding a “way around it” by systematically exploring how tradition can be harnessed in new ways to repair what she has dubbed the “oil vernacular”—the contemporary building system shaped not by local, natural materials but by global commodities and plastic products made largely from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though she grew up in a household rich in art and design—she’s the daughter of the famed British sculptor Antony Gormley—she’s quick to say she’s far from a brilliant maker and more of a “bodger,” a term that means someone who does work that’s botched or shoddy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Improviser or DIYer might be more accurate. One of her first bits of architecture was a makeshift home built on the back of a truck she used to tour around England one summer in her 20s. The work of her first firm, Practice Architecture, which she cofounded after graduating from the University of Cambridge in 2009, was informed by London’s DIY subcultures and informal art spaces. She says these scenes “existed in the margins and cracks between things, but in which a lot felt possible.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frank’s Café, a bar and restaurant she built in 2009 on the roof of a parking garage in Peckham that hosted a sculpture park, was constructed from ratchet straps, scaffold boards, and castoffs she’d source from lumberyards and transport on the roof rack of an old Volvo. It was the first of a series of cultural and social spaces she and her partner Lettice Drake created using materials both low-budget and local.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Material Cultures grew out of connections Gormley made while she was teaching at London Metropolitan University. In 2019, she was a teaching assistant along with Summer Islam, who was friends with George Massoud, both architects and partners in the firm Study Abroad and advocates of more socially conscious design. The trio had a shared interest in sustainability and building practices, as well as a frustration with the architecture world’s focus on improving sustainability through high-tech design. Instead of using modern methods to build more efficient commercial and residential spaces from carbon-intensive materials like steel, they thought, why not revisit first principles? Build with locally sourced, natural materials and you don’t have to worry about making up a carbon deficit in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121752" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_CSM_Clearfell-House©Henry_Woide_021.jpg?w=1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The frame of Clearfell House was built with ash and larch, two species of wood vulnerable to climate change&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY WOIDE/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="office in a house" class="wp-image-1121747" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Flat-House_Image-Credit-Oskar-Proctor_Large44V.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Flat House was built with pressed panels of hemp grown in the fields surrounding the home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OSKAR PROCTOR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As many other practitioners look to artificial intelligence and other high-tech approaches to building, Material Cultures has always focused on sustainability, finding creative ways to turn local materials into new buildings. And the three of them don’t just design and build. They team up with traditional craft experts to explore the potential of materials like reeds and clay, and techniques like thatching and weaving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than any one project, Gormley, Islam, and Massoud are perhaps best known for their meditation on the subject of how architects work. Published in 2022, &lt;em&gt;Material Reform: Building for a Post-Carbon Future&lt;/em&gt; is a pocket-size book that drills into materials and methodologies to suggest a more thoughtful, ecological architecture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is a huge amount of technological knowledge and intelligence in historic, traditional, vernacular ways of doing things that’s been evolved over millennia, not just the last 100 years,” Gormley says. “We’re really about trying to tap into that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Material Cultures’ early works, Flat House, a home built in 2019 in Cambridgeshire, England, with pressed panels of hemp grown in the surrounding fields, was meant as an exploration of what kind of building could be made from what a single farm could produce. Gormley was there from the planting of the seeds to the harvesting of the hemp plants to the completion of construction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was incredible understanding that buildings could be part of these natural cycles,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clearfell House, a timber A-frame cabin tucked into a clearing in the Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire, England, exemplifies the firm’s obsession with elevating humble materials and vernacular techniques. Every square inch of the house, which was finished in late 2024 as part of a construction class Material Cultures’ architects taught at Central Saint Martins design school in London, emerged from extensive research into British timber, the climate crisis, and how forestry is changing. That meant making the frame from local ash and larch, two species of wood specifically chosen because they were affected by climate change, and avoiding the use of factory-farmed lumber. The modular system used for the structure was made to be replicated at scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find it rare that architecture offices have such a clear framing and mission,” says Andreas Lang, head of the Saint Martins architecture program. “Emerging practices often become client-dependent. For [Material Cultures], the client is maybe the planet.”&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Material Cultures fits in with the boom in popularity for more sustainable materials, waste-minimizing construction, and panelized building using straw and hemp, says Michael Burchert, a German expert on decarbonized buildings. “People are grabbing the good stuff from the hippies at the moment,” he says. Regulation has started to follow: France recently mandated that new public buildings be constructed with 50% timber or other biological material, and Denmark’s construction sector has embarked on a project, Pathways to Biobased Construction, to promote use of nature-based products in new building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Burchert appreciates the way the firm melds theory and practice. “We have academia, and academia is full of papers,” he says. “We need makers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, Gormley and her cofounders have developed a portfolio of work that rethinks construction supply chains and stays grounded in social impact. The just-finished Wolves Lane Centre, a $2.4 million community center in North London run by a pair of groups that work on food and racial justice, didn’t just reflect Material Cultures’ typical focus on bio-based materials—in this case, local straw, lime, and timber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121751" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_26.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121749" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_22.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;For Wolves Lane Centre, a $2.4 million community facility for groups working on food and racial justice, expert plasterers and specialists in straw-bale construction were brought in so their processes could be shared and learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121748" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_9.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a project of self-determination and learning, says Gormley. Expert plasterers and specialists in straw-bale construction were brought in so the processes could be shared and learned. Introducing this kind of teaching into the construction process was quite time-consuming and, Gormley says, was as expensive as using contemporary techniques, if not more so. But the added value was worth it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people who become the custodians of these buildings then have the skills to maintain and repair, as well as evolve, the site over time,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Burchert puts it, science fiction tends to show a future built of concrete and steel; Material Cultures instead offers something natural, communal, and innovative, a needed paradigm shift. And it’s increasingly working on a larger scale. The Phoenix, a forthcoming low-carbon development in the southern English city of Lewes that’s being developed by a former managing director for Greenpeace, will use the firm’s designs for 70 of its 700 planned homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The project Gormley may be most excited about is an interdisciplinary school Material Cultures is creating north of London: a 500-acre former farm in Essex that will be a living laboratory bridging the firm’s work in supply chains, materials science, and construction. The rural site for the project, which has the working title Land Lab, was deliberately chosen as a place where those connections would be inherent, Gormley says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Essex project advances the firm’s larger mission. As Gormley, Massoud, and Islam advise in their book, “Hold a vision of a radically different world in your mind while continuing to act in the world as it is, persisting in the project of making changes that are within the scope of action.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patrick Sisson, a Chicago expat living in Los Angeles, covers technology and urbanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of green certifications, better material sourcing, and the use of more sustainable materials such as mass timber, the built environment is still responsible for a third of global emissions worldwide.

Changing the way we erect and operate buildings remains key to even approaching climate goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As soon as you set out and do something differently in construction, you are constantly bumping your head against the wall,” says Paloma Gormley, a director of the London-based design and research nonprofit Material Cultures. “You can either stop there or take a step back and try to find a way around it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gormley has been finding a “way around it” by systematically exploring how tradition can be harnessed in new ways to repair what she has dubbed the “oil vernacular”—the contemporary building system shaped not by local, natural materials but by global commodities and plastic products made largely from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though she grew up in a household rich in art and design—she’s the daughter of the famed British sculptor Antony Gormley—she’s quick to say she’s far from a brilliant maker and more of a “bodger,” a term that means someone who does work that’s botched or shoddy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Improviser or DIYer might be more accurate. One of her first bits of architecture was a makeshift home built on the back of a truck she used to tour around England one summer in her 20s. The work of her first firm, Practice Architecture, which she cofounded after graduating from the University of Cambridge in 2009, was informed by London’s DIY subcultures and informal art spaces. She says these scenes “existed in the margins and cracks between things, but in which a lot felt possible.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frank’s Café, a bar and restaurant she built in 2009 on the roof of a parking garage in Peckham that hosted a sculpture park, was constructed from ratchet straps, scaffold boards, and castoffs she’d source from lumberyards and transport on the roof rack of an old Volvo. It was the first of a series of cultural and social spaces she and her partner Lettice Drake created using materials both low-budget and local.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Material Cultures grew out of connections Gormley made while she was teaching at London Metropolitan University. In 2019, she was a teaching assistant along with Summer Islam, who was friends with George Massoud, both architects and partners in the firm Study Abroad and advocates of more socially conscious design. The trio had a shared interest in sustainability and building practices, as well as a frustration with the architecture world’s focus on improving sustainability through high-tech design. Instead of using modern methods to build more efficient commercial and residential spaces from carbon-intensive materials like steel, they thought, why not revisit first principles? Build with locally sourced, natural materials and you don’t have to worry about making up a carbon deficit in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121752" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_CSM_Clearfell-House©Henry_Woide_021.jpg?w=1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The frame of Clearfell House was built with ash and larch, two species of wood vulnerable to climate change&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;HENRY WOIDE/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="office in a house" class="wp-image-1121747" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Flat-House_Image-Credit-Oskar-Proctor_Large44V.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Flat House was built with pressed panels of hemp grown in the fields surrounding the home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;OSKAR PROCTOR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As many other practitioners look to artificial intelligence and other high-tech approaches to building, Material Cultures has always focused on sustainability, finding creative ways to turn local materials into new buildings. And the three of them don’t just design and build. They team up with traditional craft experts to explore the potential of materials like reeds and clay, and techniques like thatching and weaving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than any one project, Gormley, Islam, and Massoud are perhaps best known for their meditation on the subject of how architects work. Published in 2022, &lt;em&gt;Material Reform: Building for a Post-Carbon Future&lt;/em&gt; is a pocket-size book that drills into materials and methodologies to suggest a more thoughtful, ecological architecture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is a huge amount of technological knowledge and intelligence in historic, traditional, vernacular ways of doing things that’s been evolved over millennia, not just the last 100 years,” Gormley says. “We’re really about trying to tap into that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Material Cultures’ early works, Flat House, a home built in 2019 in Cambridgeshire, England, with pressed panels of hemp grown in the surrounding fields, was meant as an exploration of what kind of building could be made from what a single farm could produce. Gormley was there from the planting of the seeds to the harvesting of the hemp plants to the completion of construction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was incredible understanding that buildings could be part of these natural cycles,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clearfell House, a timber A-frame cabin tucked into a clearing in the Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire, England, exemplifies the firm’s obsession with elevating humble materials and vernacular techniques. Every square inch of the house, which was finished in late 2024 as part of a construction class Material Cultures’ architects taught at Central Saint Martins design school in London, emerged from extensive research into British timber, the climate crisis, and how forestry is changing. That meant making the frame from local ash and larch, two species of wood specifically chosen because they were affected by climate change, and avoiding the use of factory-farmed lumber. The modular system used for the structure was made to be replicated at scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find it rare that architecture offices have such a clear framing and mission,” says Andreas Lang, head of the Saint Martins architecture program. “Emerging practices often become client-dependent. For [Material Cultures], the client is maybe the planet.”&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Material Cultures fits in with the boom in popularity for more sustainable materials, waste-minimizing construction, and panelized building using straw and hemp, says Michael Burchert, a German expert on decarbonized buildings. “People are grabbing the good stuff from the hippies at the moment,” he says. Regulation has started to follow: France recently mandated that new public buildings be constructed with 50% timber or other biological material, and Denmark’s construction sector has embarked on a project, Pathways to Biobased Construction, to promote use of nature-based products in new building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Burchert appreciates the way the firm melds theory and practice. “We have academia, and academia is full of papers,” he says. “We need makers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, Gormley and her cofounders have developed a portfolio of work that rethinks construction supply chains and stays grounded in social impact. The just-finished Wolves Lane Centre, a $2.4 million community center in North London run by a pair of groups that work on food and racial justice, didn’t just reflect Material Cultures’ typical focus on bio-based materials—in this case, local straw, lime, and timber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121751" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_26.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121749" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_22.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;For Wolves Lane Centre, a $2.4 million community facility for groups working on food and racial justice, expert plasterers and specialists in straw-bale construction were brought in so their processes could be shared and learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121748" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Material-Cultures_Studio-Gil_Wolves-Lane_Image-Luke-ODonovan_In-Use_Large_9.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;LUKE O’DONOVAN/COURTESY OF MATERIAL CULTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a project of self-determination and learning, says Gormley. Expert plasterers and specialists in straw-bale construction were brought in so the processes could be shared and learned. Introducing this kind of teaching into the construction process was quite time-consuming and, Gormley says, was as expensive as using contemporary techniques, if not more so. But the added value was worth it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people who become the custodians of these buildings then have the skills to maintain and repair, as well as evolve, the site over time,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Burchert puts it, science fiction tends to show a future built of concrete and steel; Material Cultures instead offers something natural, communal, and innovative, a needed paradigm shift. And it’s increasingly working on a larger scale. The Phoenix, a forthcoming low-carbon development in the southern English city of Lewes that’s being developed by a former managing director for Greenpeace, will use the firm’s designs for 70 of its 700 planned homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The project Gormley may be most excited about is an interdisciplinary school Material Cultures is creating north of London: a 500-acre former farm in Essex that will be a living laboratory bridging the firm’s work in supply chains, materials science, and construction. The rural site for the project, which has the working title Land Lab, was deliberately chosen as a place where those connections would be inherent, Gormley says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Essex project advances the firm’s larger mission.

High-speed cameras snap multiple face “probes” per second, before passing the results to a local neural network that distills these images into digital fingerprints. Before people find their seats, they are matched against an on-premises database—tagged with names, membership tiers, and watch-list flags—that’s stored behind the church’s firewall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This hypothetical scene reflects real capabilities increasingly woven into places of worship nationwide, where spiritual care and surveillance converge in ways few congregants ever realize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
