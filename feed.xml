Many people turned from casual posters to money-earning creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent, a company built by twin brothers Mukund and Madhav Jha, aims to become a similar platform for consumers when it comes to app creation. The platform allows non-technical users to create an app using prompts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While that’s not a unique pitch in 2025, Emergent intends to aid users through the app development process, while also managing different APIs and deployment steps so they don’t have to worry about various technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said on Wednesday it has raised $23 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed, with participation from Y Combinator, Together (founders of Freshworks’ Together Fund), and leading angels including former a16z GP Balaji Srinivasan, Google’s Jeff Dean, and Mistral founding team member Devendra Chaplot. The company has raised $30 million to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund, who was CTO at Google-backed quick commerce startup Dunzo in India, left the company and went to the U.S. There, he started thinking about what he wanted to build with his brother Madhav, who worked at Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Both of us are very technical, and we have been into programming since we were 12. Late in 2023, we spent time with people at different AI labs, and we realized AI-powered coding is going to take off given how much effort they were allocating to get coding data right,” Mukund told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We had a strong belief in powerful agents coming online. But we felt that given AI’s development trajectory, agent-based app development is going to be a huge part of the economy, and we felt that was the problem we wanted to solve for the next 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing vibe coding platform Emergent with multi-agent frame work to build and test applications" class="wp-image-3049573" height="283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Multi-agent-emergent.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is clear that it doesn’t want to compete with developer-focused tools like Claude Code and Cursor, and wants to abstract the software development lifecycle for a non-technical user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund said that the company has built infrastructure chops from the ground up to support app development. He added that non-technical users might not want to know what an error in a code means, so it has developed AI agents to look for errors in the app and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I tested the app by building a vaccine and medicine tracker for my pets. While I started with a simple prompt, the agent asked a lot of questions about what kind of pets I wanted to add, if the app was for multiple people or just me, how I would like reminders to be scheduled, and a bunch of other options. It also added screens like a dashboard and an easy way to add pets and vaccinations, even though I didn’t specify it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The whole process of building and auto-testing the app took me less than half an hour, and I got a satisfactory first version of the app out of it. A lot of other vibe coding apps I have tried have failed to generate apps for their own pre-generated prompts. Emergent does have a bit of an edge there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="The screenshot also shows a pet vaccine tracker app made through Emergent Platform. The screenshot shows a dashboard with upcoming vaccinations for pets, with the number of pets added to the application and total vaccinations. " class="wp-image-3049574" height="326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-4.15.09PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Screenshot by TechCrunch/Ivan Mehta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund said that more than 1 million people have built over 1.5 million apps since the tool’s launch last year. People are eager to try vibe coding apps as an experiment, but tools will also have to make users stay with the platform and maintain the apps. The company said that since it also takes care of deployment and back-end infrastructure, it is easier to maintain apps for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, the startup is using Expo as a mobile client to deploy mobile apps, but it said that soon it will be launching its own mobile app to natively build apps. To integrate different platforms, it also uses a universal API key with shared usage that saves users from having to create accounts for different services or model providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049575" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mobile-app.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At face value, vibe coding apps claim that you can build apps without any technical experience. Despite that, when you start building an app, you encounter technical terms and systems. The company said that it wants to educate users on technical topics, such as what is an API and how to choose different components, such as an email-sending mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent is also building a brainstorming mode for new users who might have an idea but wouldn’t know the final shape of their app. This new mode will help them navigate the ideation stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For an app economy to become sustainable, developers want other users to discover their apps and get paid in the process as well. Right now, Emergent shows some apps on its home page, but that is about it. Developers can integrate a payment option like Stripe, but they have to bring their own API key. Going forward, Emergent wants to make both discovery and monetization easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049576" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Universal-key.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent has a lot of competition in the space. Startups like Canva and Figma, along with browsers like Perplexity, Comet, and Opera Neon, are nudging users to write mini apps. Multiple startups are working on vibe coding solutions that cater to a largely non-technical audience, including Seven Seven Six-backed Vibecode and Rocket, fresh out of an Accel-backed $15 million Series A funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at Lightspeed, said that the venture firm was looking for a startup with deep technical expertise in bringing app-making capabilities to the masses, and Emergent performed above expectations in its testing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the biggest roadblocks for participating in the digital economy is the ability to code. We wanted to invest in a company that brings the capability bar [for being able to code] next to zero, so [appmaking] becomes a function of intent,” Mohapatra told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that Emergent stood out from others because the platform enables the post-development lifecycle of deployment, sharing, bug fixing, and support with AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In the last decade, as the camera quality of smartphones improved, platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok rose in popularity for photo and video sharing.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The service competes with Pinterest’s collage feature, where users create mood boards using their favorite Pins and other images.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Mixboard, however, there’s no need to have an established image collection to pull ideas from. Instead, users can start their own project using text prompts to have AI fill in the ideas. (Pre-populated boards you can edit are also available if you need a little help in the creativity department.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049682" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Japandi_Office.max-1080x1080.format-webp.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The service is initially available as a public beta in the U.S. via Google Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After you create images using AI, you can then ask the AI to make edits and other small changes, or even combine images. This leverages Google’s new image editing model, Nano Banana, which has been enthusiastically received for its ability to handle more complex edits and make realistic images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Following its launch, Google’s Gemini AI app pushed ChatGPT out of the top spot on the U.S. App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Mixboard, Google is catering to user demand for Nano Banana by incorporating it in its own product, which it suggests could be used to brainstorm ideas involving home decor and design, event themes, DIY projects, and more, with both images and text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049679" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DIY_Dresser.max-1080x1080.format-webp.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger users have shown some interest in making digital mood boards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pinterest found viral success with a standalone collage-making app, Shuffles, which Gen Z users used to make creative TikTok videos. The app’s features were later integrated into Pinterest itself. Other startups have also explored this space, like Landing (now shuttered), the AI-powered creative app Verse (which seems to have inspired Mixboard), and more. Depop today also launched a collage-making tool to help its users to style and sell their fashion collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixboard’s mood boards can also be reimagined, Google says, using options that let you “regenerate” the images to get more ideas, or to ask the AI to generate “more like this.” Plus, the AI can generate text based on the images on users’ boards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To try Mixboard, U.S. users can visit&amp;nbsp;labs.google/mixboard&amp;nbsp;to get started. A&amp;nbsp;Discord&amp;nbsp;community is also available. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s latest AI project ventures into Pinterest’s territory, as the company announced the launch of Mixboard, software that enables anyone to create AI-powered mood boards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a range of sources, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their tendency to “fill in the blanks” when sources are lacking, this leads to hallucinations. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049364" height="1285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First introduced by Anthropic last November, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts. Since its launch, companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google have adopted the standard for integrating their AI models with various data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While other tech companies explored how to apply the standard to their AI models, Ramaswami and his team at Google began investigating how the framework could be used to make the Data Commons platform more accessible earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google has also partnered with the ONE Campaign, a nonprofit organization focused on improving economic opportunities and public health in Africa, to launch the ONE Data Agent. This AI tool utilizes the MCP Server to surface tens of millions of financial and health data points in plain language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ONE Campaign approached Google’s Data Commons team with a prototype implementation of MCP on its own custom server. That interaction, Ramaswami told TechCrunch, was the turning point that led the team to build a dedicated MCP Server in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the experience is not limited to the ONE Campaign. The open nature of the Data Commons MCP Server makes it compatible with any LLM, and Google has provided several ways for developers to get started. A sample agent is available through the Agent Development Kit (ADK) in a Colab notebook, and the server can also be accessed directly via the Gemini CLI or any MCP-compatible client using the PyPI package. Example code is also provided on a GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is turning its vast public data trove into a goldmine for AI with the debut of the Data Commons Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — enabling developers, data scientists, and AI agents to access real-world statistics using natural language and better train AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a range of sources, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their tendency to “fill in the blanks” when sources are lacking, this leads to hallucinations. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049364" height="1285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First introduced by Anthropic last November, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts. Since its launch, companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google have adopted the standard for integrating their AI models with various data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While other tech companies explored how to apply the standard to their AI models, Ramaswami and his team at Google began investigating how the framework could be used to make the Data Commons platform more accessible earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced plans for five new US AI data center sites for Stargate, their joint AI infrastructure project, bringing the platform to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the sites will be developed through a partnership between SoftBank and OpenAI. One site in Lordstown, Ohio, where SoftBank has broken ground, is on track to be operational next year. The second site in Milam County, Texas, will be developed with SB Energy, a SoftBank Group company. These two sites may scale to 1.5 gigawatts over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new sites will join the flagship Stargate campus in Abilene, Texas. Oracle began delivering Nvidia hardware to that site in June, and OpenAI has already begun training (building new models) and inference (running ChatGPT) using the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown of those announced Stargate sites so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abilene, Texas: Flagship campus, already operational with Nvidia GB200 racks, plus planned 600-megawatt expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shackelford County, Texas: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doña Ana County, New Mexico: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midwest location (undisclosed): New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lordstown, Ohio: New SoftBank-developed site, operational next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milam County, Texas: New SoftBank/SB Energy site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The July agreement between OpenAI and Oracle to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate capacity represents a partnership worth over $300 billion between the two companies over five years. The companies say they selected the five new sites after reviewing over 300 proposals from more than 30 states in a nationwide process launched in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why OpenAI wants massive computing power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of numbers OpenAI and friends throw around—10 gigawatts here, $500 billion there—are somewhat staggering and mind-boggling in scope for the layperson who might not be familiar with the massive scale of Internet infrastructure. For example, ten gigawatts is equivalent to the output of roughly 10 nuclear reactors, which is enough electricity to power millions of homes. But what does OpenAI really need those data centers for? It all goes back to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's dream of providing intelligence as a service to billions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AI can only fulfill its promise if we build the compute to power it," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in the announcement. "That compute is the key to ensuring everyone can benefit from AI and to unlocking future breakthroughs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman's statement reflects optimism about the usefulness of future AI systems, but despite warnings of an AI bubble and criticism of the underlying technology, there is still actual unmet demand for generative AI capacity today. ChatGPT serves 700 million weekly active users, more than double the US population, who regularly use the AI assistant to develop software, provide personal advice, and compose or edit correspondence and reports. While the outputs may be imperfect at times, people apparently still want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI regularly faces severe capacity constraints to produce those outputs, which leads to limits on how often its users can query the chatbot. ChatGPT Plus subscribers frequently encounter these usage limits, particularly when using more compute-intensive features like image generation or simulated reasoning models. Free users, who represent a gateway for future subscriptions, face even stricter limitations. OpenAI lacks the computing capacity to meet current demand, let alone room for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training next-generation AI models compounds the problem. On top of running existing AI models like those that power ChatGPT, OpenAI is constantly working on new technology in the background. It's a process that requires thousands of specialized chips running continuously for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The circular investment question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial structure of these deals between OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia has drawn scrutiny from industry observers. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion as OpenAI deploys Nvidia systems. As Bryn Talkington of Requisite Capital Management told CNBC: "Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle's arrangement follows a similar pattern, with a reported $30 billion-per-year deal where Oracle builds facilities that OpenAI pays to use. This circular flow, which involves infrastructure providers investing in AI companies that become their biggest customers, has raised eyebrows about whether these represent genuine economic investments or elaborate accounting maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangements are becoming even more convoluted. The Information reported this week that Nvidia is discussing leasing its chips to OpenAI rather than selling them outright. Under this structure, Nvidia would create a separate entity to purchase its own GPUs, then lease them to OpenAI, which adds yet another layer of circular financial engineering to this complicated relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand," wrote tech critic Ed Zitron on Bluesky last week about the unusual flow of AI infrastructure investments. Zitron was referring to companies like CoreWeave and Lambda Labs, which have raised billions in debt to buy Nvidia GPUs based partly on contracts from Nvidia itself. It's a pattern that mirrors OpenAI's arrangements with Oracle and Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens if the bubble pops? Even Altman himself warned last month that "someone will lose a phenomenal amount of money" in what he called an AI bubble. If AI demand fails to meet these astronomical projections, the massive data centers built on physical soil won't simply vanish. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, fiber optic cable laid during the boom years eventually found use as Internet demand caught up. Similarly, these facilities could potentially pivot to cloud services, scientific computing, or other workloads, but at what might be massive losses for investors who paid AI-boom prices.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced plans for five new US AI data center sites for Stargate, their joint AI infrastructure project, bringing the platform to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the sites will be developed through a partnership between SoftBank and OpenAI. One site in Lordstown, Ohio, where SoftBank has broken ground, is on track to be operational next year. The second site in Milam County, Texas, will be developed with SB Energy, a SoftBank Group company. These two sites may scale to 1.5 gigawatts over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new sites will join the flagship Stargate campus in Abilene, Texas. Oracle began delivering Nvidia hardware to that site in June, and OpenAI has already begun training (building new models) and inference (running ChatGPT) using the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown of those announced Stargate sites so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abilene, Texas: Flagship campus, already operational with Nvidia GB200 racks, plus planned 600-megawatt expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shackelford County, Texas: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doña Ana County, New Mexico: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midwest location (undisclosed): New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lordstown, Ohio: New SoftBank-developed site, operational next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milam County, Texas: New SoftBank/SB Energy site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The July agreement between OpenAI and Oracle to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate capacity represents a partnership worth over $300 billion between the two companies over five years. The companies say they selected the five new sites after reviewing over 300 proposals from more than 30 states in a nationwide process launched in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why OpenAI wants massive computing power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of numbers OpenAI and friends throw around—10 gigawatts here, $500 billion there—are somewhat staggering and mind-boggling in scope for the layperson who might not be familiar with the massive scale of Internet infrastructure.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle&amp;nbsp;reportedly signed&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;sizable&amp;nbsp;deal with OpenAI to supply the&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;research lab with&amp;nbsp;$300 billion&amp;nbsp;worth of&amp;nbsp;compute.&amp;nbsp;Questions of how either side was going to&amp;nbsp;pay for such a deal&amp;nbsp;came shortly after.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a&amp;nbsp;$20 billion&amp;nbsp;compute&amp;nbsp;deal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Oracle announced&amp;nbsp;Monday&amp;nbsp;that Safra Catz was&amp;nbsp;transitioning from CEO&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;instead serve as the&amp;nbsp;executive vice chair of Oracle’s board of directors after 11 years at the helm.

The bill defines a “catastrophic risk” as a foreseeable, material risk that a foundation model’s development, storage, use, or deployment will result in death or serious injury to more than 50 people, or more than $1 billion in property damages arising from a single incident involving a foundation model:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing expert-level assistance in the creation or release of CBRN weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous cyberattack, murder, assault, extortion, or theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these risks in mind, SB-53 requires frontier developers to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish a frontier AI framework that includes (among other things) the developer’s capability thresholds for catastrophic risks, risk mitigations, and internal governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review and update the framework once a year, and publish modifications within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish transparency reports for each new frontier model, including technical specifications and catastrophic risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share assessments of catastrophic risks from internal use of frontier models with California’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) every 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refrain from lying about catastrophic risks from its frontier models, its management of catastrophic risks, or its compliance with its frontier AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident reporting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governments need to be alerted to critical safety incidents involving frontier AI systems—such as harms resulting from unauthorized access to model weights or loss of control of an agent—to intervene before they escalate into catastrophic outcomes. SB-53 provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OES will establish a hotline for reporting critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are required to report critical safety incidents to within 15 days, or 24 hours if there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the OES will produce a report with anonymized and aggregated information about critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill’s incident reporting requirements are also designed to accommodate future federal requirements. In the case that federal requirement for critical safety incident reporting becomes equivalent to, or stricter than, those required by SB-53, then OES can defer to those federal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower protection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;California state authorities will need to rely on whistleblowers to report whether frontier AI companies are complying with SB-53’s requirements. Given the industry’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-whistleblowers-ask-sec-investigate-restrictive-non-disclosure-agreements-2024-07-13/" rel="rel"&gt;mixed history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; regarding whistleblowers, the bill provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are prohibited from preventing or retaliating against covered employees (employees responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents) from reporting activities that they have reason to believe pose a specific and substantial catastrophic risk. (Existing whistleblower protections cover all employees and any violation of law—which includes SB-53’s transparency and incident-reporting requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Attorney General will publish a report with anonymized and aggregated information about reports from covered employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered employees can sue frontier developers for noncompliance with whistleblower protections, and the Attorney General is empowered to enforce the bill’s transparency and incident reporting requirements by punishing violations with civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here, and what happens next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; SB-1047 required frontier AI developers to implement specific controls to reduce catastrophic risk (such as shutdown controls and prohibitions on releasing unreasonably risky models), and Governor Newsom vetoed the bill under pressure from national Democratic leadership and industry lobbying. Since SB-53 only implements transparency requirements—and relies on the recommendations made by the Governor’s working group—SB-53 seems more likely to be signed into law. Anthropic has also publicly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/anthropic-bill-gavin-newsom-scott-wiener-00550029" rel="rel"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom has until October 12th to sign SB-53. If he does, SB-53 will be the first significant AI legislation to become law since Senator Ted Cruz pushed (and narrowly failed) to attach a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI enforcement to federal budget legislation. He has since picked up the idea again in a new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/9/sen-cruz-unveils-ai-policy-framework-to-strengthen-american-ai-leadership" rel="rel"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—which, if it gains traction, might set up a conflict between California and Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Cyberspace Administration of China &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c" rel="rel"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Chinese companies from buying Nvidia chips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/italy-first-in-eu-to-pass-comprehensive-law-regulating-ai" rel="rel"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence that includes criminal penalties for misuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dozens of UK lawmakers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7313320/google-deepmind-gemini-ai-safety-pledge/" rel="rel"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Google of violating its AI safety commitments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI and Anthropic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/" rel="rel"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/economic-index-geography" rel="rel"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tracking economic patterns in how people use AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI and DeepMind &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/MostafaRohani/status/1968360976379703569" rel="rel"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-achieves-gold-level-performance-at-the-international-collegiate-programming-contest-world-finals/" rel="rel"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; gold-medal performance at the International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/" rel="rel"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; up to $100 billion in OpenAI.

In the case that federal requirement for critical safety incident reporting becomes equivalent to, or stricter than, those required by SB-53, then OES can defer to those federal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower protection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;California state authorities will need to rely on whistleblowers to report whether frontier AI companies are complying with SB-53’s requirements. Given the industry’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-whistleblowers-ask-sec-investigate-restrictive-non-disclosure-agreements-2024-07-13/" rel="rel"&gt;mixed history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; regarding whistleblowers, the bill provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are prohibited from preventing or retaliating against covered employees (employees responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents) from reporting activities that they have reason to believe pose a specific and substantial catastrophic risk. (Existing whistleblower protections cover all employees and any violation of law—which includes SB-53’s transparency and incident-reporting requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Attorney General will publish a report with anonymized and aggregated information about reports from covered employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered employees can sue frontier developers for noncompliance with whistleblower protections, and the Attorney General is empowered to enforce the bill’s transparency and incident reporting requirements by punishing violations with civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here, and what happens next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; SB-1047 required frontier AI developers to implement specific controls to reduce catastrophic risk (such as shutdown controls and prohibitions on releasing unreasonably risky models), and Governor Newsom vetoed the bill under pressure from national Democratic leadership and industry lobbying. Since SB-53 only implements transparency requirements—and relies on the recommendations made by the Governor’s working group—SB-53 seems more likely to be signed into law. Anthropic has also publicly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/anthropic-bill-gavin-newsom-scott-wiener-00550029" rel="rel"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom has until October 12th to sign SB-53. If he does, SB-53 will be the first significant AI legislation to become law since Senator Ted Cruz pushed (and narrowly failed) to attach a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI enforcement to federal budget legislation. He has since picked up the idea again in a new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/9/sen-cruz-unveils-ai-policy-framework-to-strengthen-american-ai-leadership" rel="rel"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—which, if it gains traction, might set up a conflict between California and Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Cyberspace Administration of China &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c" rel="rel"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Chinese companies from buying Nvidia chips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/italy-first-in-eu-to-pass-comprehensive-law-regulating-ai" rel="rel"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence that includes criminal penalties for misuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dozens of UK lawmakers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7313320/google-deepmind-gemini-ai-safety-pledge/" rel="rel"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Google of violating its AI safety commitments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI and Anthropic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/" rel="rel"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/economic-index-geography" rel="rel"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tracking economic patterns in how people use AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenAI and DeepMind &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/MostafaRohani/status/1968360976379703569" rel="rel"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-achieves-gold-level-performance-at-the-international-collegiate-programming-contest-world-finals/" rel="rel"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; gold-medal performance at the International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nvidia is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/" rel="rel"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; up to $100 billion in OpenAI.

That’s a huge jump from 73% just a year ago, showing just how fast retailers are scrambling to avoid being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this AI gold rush comes with a dark side. As organisations weave these tools into the fabric of their operations, they are creating a massive new surface for cyberattacks and sensitive data leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s findings show a sector in transition, moving from chaotic early adoption to a more controlled, corporate-led approach. There’s been a shift away from staff using their personal AI accounts, which has more than halved from 74% to 36% since the beginning of the year. In its place, usage of company-approved GenAI tools has more than doubled, climbing from 21% to 52% in the same timeframe. It’s a sign that businesses are waking up to the dangers of “shadow AI” and trying to get a handle on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the battle for the retail desktop, ChatGPT remains king, used by 81% of organisations. Yet, its dominance is not absolute. Google Gemini has made inroads with 60% adoption, and Microsoft’s Copilot tools are hot on its heels at 56% and 51% respectively. ChatGPT’s popularity has recently seen its first-ever dip, while Microsoft 365 Copilot’s usage has surged, likely thanks to its deep integration with the productivity tools many employees use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneath the surface of this generative AI adoption by the retail industry lies a growing security nightmare. The very thing that makes these tools useful – their ability to process information – is also their biggest weakness. Retailers are seeing alarming amounts of sensitive data being fed into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of data exposed is the company’s own source code, making up 47% of all data policy violations in GenAI apps. Close behind is regulated data, like confidential customer and business information, at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, a growing number of retailers are simply banning apps they deem too risky. The app most frequently finding itself on the blocklist is ZeroGPT, with 47% of organisations banning it over concerns it stores user content and has even been caught redirecting data to third-party sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newfound caution is pushing the retail industry towards more serious, enterprise-grade generative AI platforms from major cloud providers. These platforms offer far greater control, allowing companies to host models privately and build their own custom tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both OpenAI via Azure and Amazon Bedrock are tied for the lead, with each being used by 16% of retail companies. But these are no silver bullets; a simple misconfiguration could inadvertently connect a powerful AI directly to a company’s crown jewels, creating the potential for a catastrophic breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat isn’t just from employees using AI in their browsers. The report finds that 63% of organisations are now connecting directly to OpenAI’s API, embedding AI deep into their backend systems and automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This AI-specific risk is part of a wider, troubling pattern of poor cloud security hygiene. Attackers are increasingly using trusted names to deliver malware, knowing that an employee is more likely to click a link from a familiar service. Microsoft OneDrive is the most common culprit, with 11% of retailers hit by malware from the platform every month, while the developer hub GitHub is used in 9.7% of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing problem of employees using personal apps at work continues to pour fuel on the fire. Social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn are used in nearly every retail environment (96% and 94% respectively), alongside personal cloud storage accounts. It’s on these unapproved personal services that the worst data breaches happen. When employees upload files to personal apps, 76% of the resulting policy violations involve regulated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security leaders in retail, casual generative AI experimentation is over. Netskope’s findings are a warning that organisations must act decisively. It’s time to gain full visibility of all web traffic, block high-risk applications, and enforce strict data protection policies to control what information can be sent where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without adequate governance, the next innovation could easily become the next headline-making breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Frederik, Snowflake: Data quality is key to AI-driven growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Vice President of Generative AI Software Kari Briski today joined Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Evan Solomon and Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere, in a special address moderated by SiriusXM host Amber Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re all here to deliver the next big thing,” Solomon told the room full of founders, researchers, investors and students. “The AI revolution is the birth not just of a new technology — this is the birth of the age of the entrepreneur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session comes as Canadian communications technology company and NVIDIA Cloud Partner TELUS announces the launch of Canada’s first fully sovereign AI factory in Rimouski, Quebec, powered by&amp;nbsp; the latest NVIDIA accelerated computing, and financial services company RBC Capital Markets continues building AI agents for capital markets using NVIDIA software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For our government, for our country, ‘All In’ means building digital sovereignty — the most pressing policy, democratic issue of our time,” Solomon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every nation should develop its own AI — not just outsource it,” Briski said during the panel conversation following Solomon’s address. “AI must reflect local values, understand cultural context and align with national norms and policies. It needs to speak and write in the nuanced patterns of your natural language. Digital intelligence isn’t something you can simply outsource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85262"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85262 size-large" height="1260" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9132-1680x1260.jpeg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85262"&gt;From left to right, Amber Mac, SiriusXM podcast host and moderator; Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at NVIDIA; Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere; Evan Solomon, Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s AI journey, bringing together public and private sector leaders to spotlight the national infrastructure, innovation and policy that shape the future of artificial intelligence. It underscores the country’s commitment to digital sovereignty, economic competitiveness and the responsible development of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada must own the tools and the rules that matter at this critical moment,” Solomon said. “We need our digital insurance policy — and that’s what we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s AI momentum is accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TELUS’ new facility, powered by NVIDIA’s computing and software, and built in collaboration with HPE, offers end-to-end AI capabilities — from model training to inferencing — while ensuring full data residency and control within Canadian borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory is already serving clients including OpenText, and is powered by 99% renewable energy and TELUS’ PureFibre network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture will develop and deploy industry-specific solutions on the TELUS sovereign AI platform, accelerating AI adoption across its Canadian clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And League, Canada’s leading healthcare consumer experience provider, will run its comprehensive suite of AI-powered healthcare solutions using the TELUS Sovereign AI Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is the latest in a global wave of initiatives as countries activate AI to supercharge their economies and research ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang has appeared at events in France, Germany, India, Japan and the U.K., joining heads of state and industry leaders to highlight national AI strategies, announce infrastructure investments and accelerate public-private collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leadership is not a birthright,” Solomon said. “It has to be earned again and again — and the competition is fierce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last year, during a visit to Canada, Huang highlighted Canada’s pioneering role in modern AI, describing it as the “epicenter of innovation in modern AI,” building on the foundational work of pioneering Canadian AI researchers such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who is also speaking at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets works with NVIDIA software to build enterprise-grade AI agents for Capital Markets. This enables global institutions to deploy intelligent systems tailored to local needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These agents — customized with NVIDIA NeMo agent lifecycle tools and deployed using NVIDIA NIM microservices — are helping transform RBC Capital Markets’ research for faster delivery of insights to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets, TELUS and NVIDIA are sharing more on best practices for agentic AI development in a special session at All In on Wednesday from 4:15-5 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Vice President of Generative AI Software Kari Briski today joined Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Evan Solomon and Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere, in a special address moderated by SiriusXM host Amber Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re all here to deliver the next big thing,” Solomon told the room full of founders, researchers, investors and students. “The AI revolution is the birth not just of a new technology — this is the birth of the age of the entrepreneur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session comes as Canadian communications technology company and NVIDIA Cloud Partner TELUS announces the launch of Canada’s first fully sovereign AI factory in Rimouski, Quebec, powered by&amp;nbsp; the latest NVIDIA accelerated computing, and financial services company RBC Capital Markets continues building AI agents for capital markets using NVIDIA software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For our government, for our country, ‘All In’ means building digital sovereignty — the most pressing policy, democratic issue of our time,” Solomon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every nation should develop its own AI — not just outsource it,” Briski said during the panel conversation following Solomon’s address. “AI must reflect local values, understand cultural context and align with national norms and policies. It needs to speak and write in the nuanced patterns of your natural language. Digital intelligence isn’t something you can simply outsource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85262"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85262 size-large" height="1260" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9132-1680x1260.jpeg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85262"&gt;From left to right, Amber Mac, SiriusXM podcast host and moderator; Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at NVIDIA; Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere; Evan Solomon, Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s AI journey, bringing together public and private sector leaders to spotlight the national infrastructure, innovation and policy that shape the future of artificial intelligence. It underscores the country’s commitment to digital sovereignty, economic competitiveness and the responsible development of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada must own the tools and the rules that matter at this critical moment,” Solomon said. “We need our digital insurance policy — and that’s what we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s AI momentum is accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TELUS’ new facility, powered by NVIDIA’s computing and software, and built in collaboration with HPE, offers end-to-end AI capabilities — from model training to inferencing — while ensuring full data residency and control within Canadian borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory is already serving clients including OpenText, and is powered by 99% renewable energy and TELUS’ PureFibre network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture will develop and deploy industry-specific solutions on the TELUS sovereign AI platform, accelerating AI adoption across its Canadian clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And League, Canada’s leading healthcare consumer experience provider, will run its comprehensive suite of AI-powered healthcare solutions using the TELUS Sovereign AI Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is the latest in a global wave of initiatives as countries activate AI to supercharge their economies and research ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang has appeared at events in France, Germany, India, Japan and the U.K., joining heads of state and industry leaders to highlight national AI strategies, announce infrastructure investments and accelerate public-private collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

The August round was an oversubscribed $500 million round at a $6.8 billion valuation, the company said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere also announced an interesting twist on a partnership. While competitor OpenAI just nabbed an up-to $100 billion investment from the biggest GPU player, Nvidia, Cohere has signed a deal with AMD, which is one of its investors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s full suite of Command-family AI models, including the Command vision, translate, and reasoning models, can now run on AMD’s Instinct GPU, an Nvidia GPU competitor. Moreover, AMD will be using Cohere internally as a customer. Cohere is not, however, abandoning support of Nvidia GPUs to strictly support AMD, the company tells TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere began as a front-runner in the AI model race. It was co-founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “transformer” paper that gave rise to the modern generative AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe-inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI, for instance, was reportedly valued at $500 billion last month while Anthropic hit a $183 billion valuation early this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent — that is, keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Nexxus Capital Management (known for its Singapore network) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the international association of investor Nexxus. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app, Neon Mobile, pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot showing Neon Mobile's website" class="wp-image-3049880" height="1756" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/neon-mobile-2025-09-24-at-3.11.50PM.jpg" width="3182" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Neon Mobile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;…worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot from Neon's privacy policy, which reads:

&amp;quot;Recordings Generally. Certain features of the Service may permit users to send, submit, upload, or otherwise authorize the capture of (&amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; Recordings and other information to the Service. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the Recordings that you Submit to the Service, subject to these Terms including Neon Mobile's rights and licenses granted to Neon Mobile under these Terms. For avoidance of doubt, your rights in Recordings are limited to playback and viewing of your own Recordings through our mobile application, which features we may offer in our sole discretion. 2. License Grant to Neon Mobile. By Submitting Recordings or other information to the Service, you grant Neon Mobile a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-3049882" height="520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.17.31PM.jpg" width="2686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Neon (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Neon’s app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome‘s Privacy, Security &amp;amp; Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it&amp;nbsp;… It’s an interesting approach,” says Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed&amp;nbsp;— and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users’ calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon claims it removes users’ names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-ai-desensitized-users-to-privacy-concerns"&gt;Has AI desensitized users to privacy concerns? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them, it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps, which often aren’t as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that’s “commercially available” on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others’ privacy at risk when they do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app, Neon Mobile, pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot showing Neon Mobile's website" class="wp-image-3049880" height="1756" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/neon-mobile-2025-09-24-at-3.11.50PM.jpg" width="3182" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Neon Mobile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;…worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a screenshot from Neon's privacy policy, which reads:

&amp;quot;Recordings Generally. Certain features of the Service may permit users to send, submit, upload, or otherwise authorize the capture of (&amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; Recordings and other information to the Service. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the Recordings that you Submit to the Service, subject to these Terms including Neon Mobile's rights and licenses granted to Neon Mobile under these Terms. For avoidance of doubt, your rights in Recordings are limited to playback and viewing of your own Recordings through our mobile application, which features we may offer in our sole discretion. 2. License Grant to Neon Mobile. By Submitting Recordings or other information to the Service, you grant Neon Mobile a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-3049882" height="520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-3.17.31PM.jpg" width="2686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Neon (screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though Neon’s app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome‘s Privacy, Security &amp;amp; Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it&amp;nbsp;… It’s an interesting approach,” says Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed&amp;nbsp;— and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users’ calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon claims it removes users’ names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be.&lt;/p&gt;

AI should follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why the NVIDIA Nemotron family of multimodal AI models, datasets and techniques is openly available. Accessible for research and commercial use, from local PCs to enterprise-scale systems, Nemotron provides an open foundation for building AI applications. It’s available for developers to get started on GitHub, Hugging Face and OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron enables developers, startups and enterprises of any size to use models trained with transparent, open-source training data. It offers tools to accelerate every phase of development, from customization to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology’s transparency means that its adopters can understand how their models work and trust the results they provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron’s capabilities for generalized intelligence and agentic AI reasoning — and its adaptability to specialized AI use cases — have led to its widespread use today by AI innovators and leaders across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, education and retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s NVIDIA Nemotron?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Nemotron is a collection of open-source AI technologies designed for efficient AI development at every stage. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal models: &lt;/b&gt;State-of-the-art AI models, delivered as open checkpoints, that excel at graduate-level scientific reasoning, advanced math, coding, instruction following, tool calling and visual reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pretraining&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, post-training and multimodal datasets:&lt;/b&gt; Collections of carefully chosen text, image and video data that teach AI models skills including language, math and problem-solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Numerical precision algorithms and recipes: &lt;/b&gt;Advanced precision techniques that make AI faster and cheaper to run while keeping answers accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;System software for scaling training efficiently on GPU clusters: &lt;/b&gt;Optimized software and frameworks that unlock accelerating training and inference on NVIDIA GPUs at massive scale for the largest models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-training methodologies and software: &lt;/b&gt;Fine-tuning steps that make AI smarter, safer and better at specific jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron is part of NVIDIA’s wider efforts to provide open, transparent and adaptable AI platforms for developers, industry leaders and AI infrastructure builders across the private and public sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85292" height="512" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ai-on-nemotron-v5.jpg" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the Difference Between Generalized Intelligence and Specialized Intelligence?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA built Nemotron to raise the bar for generalized intelligence capabilities — including AI reasoning — while also accelerating specialization, helping businesses worldwide adopt AI for industry-specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalized intelligence refers to models trained on vast public datasets to perform a wide range of tasks. It serves as the engine needed for broad problem-solving and reasoning tasks. Specialized intelligence learns the unique language, processes and priorities of an industry or organization, giving AI models the ability to adapt to specific real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deliver AI at scale across every industry, both are essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Nemotron provides pretrained foundation models optimized for a range of computing platforms, as well as tools like NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA Dynamo to transform generalized AI models into custom models tailored for specialized intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Are Developers and Enterprises Using Nemotron?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is building Nemotron to accelerate the work of developers everywhere — and to inform the design of future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From researchers to startups and global enterprises, developers need flexible, trustworthy AI. Nemotron offers the tools to build, customize and integrate AI for virtually any field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CrowdStrike&lt;/b&gt; is integrating its Charlotte AI AgentWorks no-code platform for security teams with Nemotron, helping to power and secure the agentic ecosystem. This collaboration redefines security operations by enabling analysts to build and deploy specialized AI agents at scale, leveraging trusted, enterprise-grade security with Nemotron models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DataRobot&lt;/b&gt; is using Nemotron as the open foundation for training, customizing and managing AI agents at scale in the Agent Workforce Platform co-developed with NVIDIA— a solution for building, operating and governing a fully functional AI agent workforce, in on-premises, hybrid and multi-cloud environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;introduced the Apriel Nemotron 15B model earlier this year in partnership with NVIDIA. Post-trained with data from both companies, the model is purpose-built for real-time workflow execution and delivers advanced reasoning in a smaller size, making it faster, more efficient, and cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK-LLM&lt;/b&gt;, a sovereign AI initiative led by University College London, used Nemotron open-source techniques and datasets to develop an AI reasoning model for English and Welsh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA also uses the insights gained from developing Nemotron to inform the design of its next-generation systems, including Grace Blackwell, Vera Rubin and Feynman. The latest innovations in AI models, including reduced precision, sparse arithmetic, new attention mechanisms and optimization algorithms, all shape GPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, NVFP4, a new data format that uses just four bits per parameter during large language model (LLM) training, was discovered with Nemotron. This advancement — which dramatically reduces energy use — is influencing the design of future NVIDIA systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA also improves Nemotron with open technologies built by the broader AI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alibaba&lt;/b&gt;’s Qwen open model has provided data augmentation that has improved Nemotron’s pretraining and post-training datasets. The latest Qwen3-Next architecture pushed the frontier of long-context AI, the model leverages Gated Delta Networks from NVIDIA research and MIT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DeepSeek R1&lt;/b&gt;, a pioneer in AI reasoning, led to the development of Nemotron math, code and reasoning open datasets that can be used to teach models how to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenAI&lt;/b&gt;’s gpt-oss open-weight models demonstrate incredible reasoning, math and tool calling capabilities, including adjustable reasoning settings, that can be used to strengthen Nemotron post-training datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Llama collection of open models by &lt;b&gt;Meta&lt;/b&gt; is the foundation for Llama-Nemotron, an open family of models that used Nemotron datasets and recipes to add advanced reasoning capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training and customizing AI models and agents with NVIDIA Nemotron models and data on Hugging Face, or try models for free on OpenRouter. Developers using NVIDIA RTX PCs can access Nemotron via the llama.cpp framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Join NVIDIA for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agentic AI Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; at NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Oct. 29. The event will bring together developers, researchers and technology leaders to highlight how NVIDIA technologies are accelerating national AI priorities and powering the next generation of AI agents.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AI should follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why the NVIDIA Nemotron family of multimodal AI models, datasets and techniques is openly available. Accessible for research and commercial use, from local PCs to enterprise-scale systems, Nemotron provides an open foundation for building AI applications. It’s available for developers to get started on GitHub, Hugging Face and OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron enables developers, startups and enterprises of any size to use models trained with transparent, open-source training data. It offers tools to accelerate every phase of development, from customization to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology’s transparency means that its adopters can understand how their models work and trust the results they provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron’s capabilities for generalized intelligence and agentic AI reasoning — and its adaptability to specialized AI use cases — have led to its widespread use today by AI innovators and leaders across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, education and retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s NVIDIA Nemotron?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Nemotron is a collection of open-source AI technologies designed for efficient AI development at every stage. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal models: &lt;/b&gt;State-of-the-art AI models, delivered as open checkpoints, that excel at graduate-level scientific reasoning, advanced math, coding, instruction following, tool calling and visual reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pretraining&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, post-training and multimodal datasets:&lt;/b&gt; Collections of carefully chosen text, image and video data that teach AI models skills including language, math and problem-solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Numerical precision algorithms and recipes: &lt;/b&gt;Advanced precision techniques that make AI faster and cheaper to run while keeping answers accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;System software for scaling training efficiently on GPU clusters: &lt;/b&gt;Optimized software and frameworks that unlock accelerating training and inference on NVIDIA GPUs at massive scale for the largest models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-training methodologies and software: &lt;/b&gt;Fine-tuning steps that make AI smarter, safer and better at specific jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemotron is part of NVIDIA’s wider efforts to provide open, transparent and adaptable AI platforms for developers, industry leaders and AI infrastructure builders across the private and public sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85292" height="512" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ai-on-nemotron-v5.jpg" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the Difference Between Generalized Intelligence and Specialized Intelligence?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA built Nemotron to raise the bar for generalized intelligence capabilities — including AI reasoning — while also accelerating specialization, helping businesses worldwide adopt AI for industry-specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalized intelligence refers to models trained on vast public datasets to perform a wide range of tasks. It serves as the engine needed for broad problem-solving and reasoning tasks. Specialized intelligence learns the unique language, processes and priorities of an industry or organization, giving AI models the ability to adapt to specific real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deliver AI at scale across every industry, both are essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Nemotron provides pretrained foundation models optimized for a range of computing platforms, as well as tools like NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA Dynamo to transform generalized AI models into custom models tailored for specialized intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Are Developers and Enterprises Using Nemotron?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is building Nemotron to accelerate the work of developers everywhere — and to inform the design of future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From researchers to startups and global enterprises, developers need flexible, trustworthy AI. Nemotron offers the tools to build, customize and integrate AI for virtually any field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CrowdStrike&lt;/b&gt; is integrating its Charlotte AI AgentWorks no-code platform for security teams with Nemotron, helping to power and secure the agentic ecosystem. This collaboration redefines security operations by enabling analysts to build and deploy specialized AI agents at scale, leveraging trusted, enterprise-grade security with Nemotron models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DataRobot&lt;/b&gt; is using Nemotron as the open foundation for training, customizing and managing AI agents at scale in the Agent Workforce Platform co-developed with NVIDIA— a solution for building, operating and governing a fully functional AI agent workforce, in on-premises, hybrid and multi-cloud environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;introduced the Apriel Nemotron 15B model earlier this year in partnership with NVIDIA. Post-trained with data from both companies, the model is purpose-built for real-time workflow execution and delivers advanced reasoning in a smaller size, making it faster, more efficient, and cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK-LLM&lt;/b&gt;, a sovereign AI initiative led by University College London, used Nemotron open-source techniques and datasets to develop an AI reasoning model for English and Welsh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA also uses the insights gained from developing Nemotron to inform the design of its next-generation systems, including Grace Blackwell, Vera Rubin and Feynman. The latest innovations in AI models, including reduced precision, sparse arithmetic, new attention mechanisms and optimization algorithms, all shape GPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, NVFP4, a new data format that uses just four bits per parameter during large language model (LLM) training, was discovered with Nemotron. This advancement — which dramatically reduces energy use — is influencing the design of future NVIDIA systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA also improves Nemotron with open technologies built by the broader AI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alibaba&lt;/b&gt;’s Qwen open model has provided data augmentation that has improved Nemotron’s pretraining and post-training datasets. The latest Qwen3-Next architecture pushed the frontier of long-context AI, the model leverages Gated Delta Networks from NVIDIA research and MIT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;DeepSeek R1&lt;/b&gt;, a pioneer in AI reasoning, led to the development of Nemotron math, code and reasoning open datasets that can be used to teach models how to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenAI&lt;/b&gt;’s gpt-oss open-weight models demonstrate incredible reasoning, math and tool calling capabilities, including adjustable reasoning settings, that can be used to strengthen Nemotron post-training datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Llama collection of open models by &lt;b&gt;Meta&lt;/b&gt; is the foundation for Llama-Nemotron, an open family of models that used Nemotron datasets and recipes to add advanced reasoning capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training and customizing AI models and agents with NVIDIA Nemotron models and data on Hugging Face, or try models for free on OpenRouter. Developers using NVIDIA RTX PCs can access Nemotron via the llama.cpp framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Join NVIDIA for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agentic AI Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; at NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Oct. 29. The event will bring together developers, researchers and technology leaders to highlight how NVIDIA technologies are accelerating national AI priorities and powering the next generation of AI agents.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
