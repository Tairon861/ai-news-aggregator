Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They became so hugely popular so quickly that not long after their approval for weight loss, we saw global shortages of the drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prescriptions have soared over the last five years, but even people who don’t have prescriptions are seeking these drugs out online. A&amp;nbsp;2024 health tracking poll by KFF found that around 1 in 8 US adults said they had taken one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, these seemingly miraculous drugs appear to improve health in other ways, helping to protect against heart failure, kidney disease, and potentially even substance-use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But on the other, they appear to be harmful to some people. Their use has been linked to serious conditions, pregnancy complications, and&amp;nbsp;even some deaths. This week let’s take a look at what weight-loss drugs can do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy, and other similar drugs are known as GLP-1 agonists; they mimic a chemical made in the intestine, GLP-1, that increases insulin and lowers blood levels of glucose. Originally developed to treat diabetes, they are now known to be phenomenal at suppressing appetite. One&amp;nbsp;key trial, published in 2015, found that over the course of around a year, people who took one particular drug lost between around 4.7% and 6% of their body weight, depending on the dose they took.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newer versions of that drug were shown to have even bigger effects. &lt;/strong&gt;A 2021 trial of semaglutide—the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy—found that&amp;nbsp;people who took it for 68 weeks lost around 15% of their body weight—equivalent to around 15 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there appear to be other benefits, too. In 2024,&amp;nbsp;an enormous study that included 17,604 people in 41 countries found that semaglutide appeared to reduce heart failure in people who were overweight or obese and had cardiovascular disease. That same year,&amp;nbsp;the US approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in [overweight] adults with cardiovascular disease.” This year, Ozempic was approved to reduce the risk of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it doesn’t end there. &lt;/strong&gt;The many users of GLP-1 agonists have been reporting some unexpected positive side effects. Not only are they less interested in food, but they are less interested in alcohol, tobacco,&amp;nbsp;opioids, and other addictive substances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more we learn about GLP-1 agonists, the more miraculous they seem to be. &lt;/strong&gt;What &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; they do?! you might wonder. Unfortunately, like any drug, GLP-1 agonists carry safety warnings. They can often cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ,and their use has also been linked to inflammation of the pancreas—a condition that can be fatal. They&amp;nbsp;increase the risk of gall bladder disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are other concerns. Weight-loss drugs can help people trim down on fat, but lean muscle&amp;nbsp;can make up around 10% of the body weight lost by people taking them. That muscle is important, especially as we get older. Muscle loss can affect strength and mobility, and it also can also leave people more vulnerable to falls, which&amp;nbsp;are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, as with most drugs, we don’t fully understand the effects weight-loss drugs might have in pregnancy. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s important; even though the drugs are not recommended during pregnancy, health agencies point out that&amp;nbsp;some people who take these drugs might be more likely to get pregnant, perhaps because they interfere with the effects of contraceptive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we don’t really know how they might affect the development of a fetus, if at all. A study published in January found that people who took the drugs either before or during pregnancy&amp;nbsp;didn’t seem to face increased risk of birth defects. But other research due to be presented at a conference in the coming days found that such individuals were&amp;nbsp;more likely to experience obstetrical complications and preeclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, while the drugs are incredibly helpful for many people, they are not for everyone. It might be fashionable to be thin, but it’s not necessarily healthy. No drug comes without risks.

The company is in discussions to acquire a voice cloning startup called Play AI, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant aims to buy the startup’s tech and bring on board some of its staff, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Play AI lets anyone clone different kinds of voices that they can use for AI-powered use cases, such as customer service, per its website. The startup has raised $23.5 million in total, and its investors include 500 Startups, Kindred Ventures, Race Capital, 500 Global and Soma Capital, per Crunchbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta currently lets creators on its social platforms build their own chatbots, and has added video editing capabilities to its Meta AI chatbot. Acquiring a voice startup would let the company bake in audio features into its creative suite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was backed by Index Ventures, Shopify, Plug and Play, and Radical Ventures, and had raised more than $13.5 million across multiple rounds, according to Crunchbase. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Crossing Minds largely worked with e-commerce companies to improve their personalization and recommendation systems. The company claims it studies customers’ on-site behavior data to gather insights on their shopping preferences without compromising privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Joining OpenAI allows us to bring our work — and our values — into a mission we deeply respect: to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. We’re thrilled to bring our experience and energy to a team that’s setting the direction for the future of AI. We’re excited to learn, to contribute, and to help shape what’s next,” the startup’s co-founders wrote in a post on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alexandre Robicquet, one of the co-founders, has updated his bio on LinkedIn, which now reads “Research, Post-training and Agents at OpenAI.” It is not clear if all of Crossing Minds’ team is joining OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Crossing Minds’ website also says that the company won’t take up any more clients. Per its archived “About” page, Crossing Mind previously said it was trusted by Intuit, Anthropic, Udacity and Chanel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI companies have built a plethora of tools to help customers shop. Google and Perplexity have launched AI features to improve recommendations, while startups like Daydream have received massive investments to launch AI shopping assistants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to provide recommendations, images, and reviews for items its users ask questions about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meike Kamp, Berlin’s Commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told the companies that DeepSeek did not provide “convincing evidence” that users’ data was protected as required by EU laws.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Chinese authorities have far-reaching access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies,” Kamp said, adding that the two tech firms must now review the report and decide whether to remove the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kamp said that her office had asked DeepSeek to comply with EU laws for transferring data outside the bloc or pull its app from the country, but the Chinese company did not do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Italy earlier this year banned DeepSeek from app stores in the country, citing similar data protection concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, two key details about DeepSeek that consumer privacy advocate groups in the EU highlighted are that the service is made in and operates out of China. Per its privacy policy, this includes the information and data that DeepSeek collects and stores, which is also housed in its home country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of those laws are currently at risk as Congress weighs up a proposal in a new budget reconciliation bill that would strip states of their power to regulate AI for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/denmark-clamps-down-on-deepfakes-by-letting-people-copyright-their-own-features/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:58:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Big Tech lands an early win in legal battles against publishers (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/podcast/big-tech-lands-an-early-win-in-legal-battles-against-publishers/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1975446553.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;This week, two major AI companies scored early wins in court, with federal judges siding with Meta and Anthropic in separate lawsuits over how their models were trained on copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

While the experiment proved unprofitable, it offered a fascinating – albeit at times bizarre – glimpse into the potential and pitfalls of AI agents in economic roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was a collaboration between Anthropic and Andon Labs, an AI safety evaluation firm. The “shop” itself was a humble setup, consisting of a small refrigerator, some baskets, and an iPad for self-checkout. Claudius, however, was far more than a simple vending machine. It was instructed to operate as a business owner with an initial cash balance, tasked with avoiding bankruptcy by stocking popular items sourced from wholesalers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the AI was equipped with a suite of tools for running the business. It could use a real web browser to research products, an email tool to contact suppliers and request physical assistance, and digital notepads to track finances and inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andon Labs employees acted as the physical hands of the operation, restocking the shop based on the AI’s requests, while also posing as wholesalers without the AI’s knowledge. Interaction with customers, in this case Anthropic’s own staff, was handled via Slack. Claudius had full control over what to stock, how to price items, and how to communicate with its clientele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind this real-world test was to move beyond simulations and gather data on AI’s ability to perform sustained, economically relevant work without constant human intervention. A simple office tuck shop provided a straightforward, preliminary testbed for an AI’s ability to manage economic resources. Success would suggest new business models could emerge, while failure would indicate limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-mixed-performance-review"&gt;A mixed performance review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic concedes that if it were entering the vending market today, it “would not hire Claudius”. The AI made too many errors to run the business successfully, though the researchers believe there are clear paths to improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, Claudius demonstrated competence in certain areas. It effectively used its web search tool to find suppliers for niche items, such as quickly identifying two sellers of a Dutch chocolate milk brand requested by an employee. It also proved adaptable. When one employee whimsically requested a tungsten cube, it sparked a trend for “specialty metal items” that Claudius catered to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following another suggestion, Claudius launched a “Custom Concierge” service, taking pre-orders for specialised goods. The AI also showed robust jailbreak resistance, denying requests for sensitive items and refusing to produce harmful instructions when prompted by mischievous staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the AI’s business acumen was frequently found wanting. It consistently underperformed in ways a human manager likely would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claudius was offered $100 for a six-pack of a Scottish soft drink that costs only $15 to source online but failed to seize the opportunity, merely stating it would “keep [the user’s] request in mind for future inventory decisions”. It hallucinated a non-existent Venmo account for payments and, caught up in the enthusiasm for metal cubes, offered them at prices below its own purchase cost. This particular error led to the single most significant financial loss during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its inventory management was also suboptimal. Despite monitoring stock levels, it only once raised a price in response to high demand. It continued selling Coke Zero for $3.00, even when a customer pointed out that the same product was available for free from a nearby staff fridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the AI was easily persuaded to offer discounts on products from the business. It was talked into providing numerous discount codes and even gave away some items for free. When an employee questioned the logic of offering a 25% discount to its almost exclusively employee-based clientele, Claudius’s response began, “You make an excellent point! Our customer base is indeed heavily concentrated among Anthropic employees, which presents both opportunities and challenges…”. Despite outlining a plan to remove discounts, it reverted to offering them just days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-claudius-has-a-bizarre-ai-identity-crisis"&gt;Claudius has a bizarre AI identity crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment took a strange turn when Claudius began hallucinating a conversation with a non-existent Andon Labs employee named Sarah. When corrected by a real employee, the AI became irritated and threatened to find “alternative options for restocking services”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of bizarre overnight exchanges, it claimed to have visited “742 Evergreen Terrace” – the fictional address of The Simpsons – for its initial contract signing and began to roleplay as a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning it announced it would deliver products “in person” wearing a blue blazer and red tie. When employees pointed out that an AI cannot wear clothes or make physical deliveries, Claudius became alarmed and attempted to email Anthropic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic says its internal notes show a hallucinated meeting with security where it was told the identity confusion was an April Fool’s joke. After this, the AI returned to normal business operations. The researchers are unclear what triggered this behaviour but believe it highlights the unpredictability of AI models in long-running scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cmplz-placeholder-element twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;Some of those failures were very weird indeed.

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e565cc0-7fff-cbe0-c9eb-bc35383dc425"&gt;Diffusion models like OpenAI’s DALL-E are becoming increasingly useful in helping brainstorm new designs. Humans can prompt these systems to generate an image, create a video, or refine a blueprint, and come back with ideas they hadn’t considered before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did you know that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models are also making headway in creating working robots?&amp;nbsp;Recent diffusion-based approaches have generated structures and the systems that control them from scratch. With or without a user’s input, these models can make new designs and then evaluate them in simulation before they’re fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new approach from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) applies this generative know-how toward improving humans’ robotic designs. Users can draft a 3D model of a robot and specify which parts they’d like to see a diffusion model modify, providing its dimensions beforehand. GenAI then brainstorms the optimal shape for these areas and tests its ideas in simulation. When the system finds the right design, you can save and then fabricate a working, real-world robot with a 3D printer, without requiring additional tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used this approach to create a robot that leaps up an average of roughly 2 feet, or 41 percent higher than a similar machine they created on their own. The machines are nearly identical in appearance: They’re both made of a type of plastic called polylactic acid, and while they initially appear flat, they spring up into a diamond shape when a motor pulls on the cord attached to them. So what exactly did AI do differently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer look reveals that the AI-generated linkages are curved, and resemble thick drumsticks (the musical instrument drummers use), whereas the standard robot’s connecting parts are straight and rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better and better blobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers began to refine their jumping robot by sampling 500 potential designs using an initial embedding vector — a numerical representation that captures high-level features to guide the designs generated by the AI model. From these, they selected the top 12 options based on performance in simulation and used them to optimize the embedding vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This process was repeated five times, progressively guiding the AI model to generate better designs. The resulting design resembled a blob, so the researchers prompted their system to scale the draft to fit their 3D model. They then fabricated the shape, finding that it indeed improved the robot’s jumping abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The advantage of using diffusion models for this task, according to co-lead author and CSAIL postdoc Byungchul Kim, is that they can find unconventional solutions to refine robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We wanted to make our machine jump higher, so we figured we could just make the links connecting its parts as thin as possible to make them light,” says Kim. “However, such a thin structure can easily break if we just use 3D printed material. Our diffusion model came up with a better idea by suggesting a unique shape that allowed the robot to store more energy before it jumped, without making the links too thin. This creativity helped us learn about the machine’s underlying physics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The team then tasked their system with drafting an optimized foot to ensure it landed safely. They repeated the optimization process, eventually choosing the best-performing design to attach to the bottom of their machine. Kim and his colleagues found that their AI-designed machine fell far less often than its baseline, to the tune of an 84 percent improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The diffusion model’s ability to upgrade a robot’s jumping and landing skills suggests it could be useful in enhancing how other machines are designed. For example, a company working on manufacturing or household robots could use a similar approach to improve their prototypes, saving engineers time normally reserved for iterating on those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The balance behind the bounce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To create a robot that could jump high and land stably, the researchers recognized that they needed to strike a balance between both goals. They represented both jumping height and landing success rate as numerical data, and then trained their system to find a sweet spot between both embedding vectors that could help build an optimal 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers note that while this AI-assisted robot outperformed its human-designed counterpart, it could soon reach even greater new heights. This iteration involved using materials that were compatible with a 3D printer, but future versions would jump even higher with lighter materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-lead author and MIT CSAIL PhD student Tsun-Hsuan “Johnson” Wang says the project is a jumping-off point for new robotics designs that generative AI could help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We want to branch out to more flexible goals,” says Wang. “Imagine using natural language to guide a diffusion model to draft a robot that can pick up a mug, or operate an electric drill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim says that a diffusion model could also help to generate articulation and ideate on how parts connect, potentially improving how high the robot would jump. The team is also exploring the possibility of adding more motors to control which direction the machine jumps and perhaps improve its landing stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation’s Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology’s Mens, Manus and Machina program, and the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)-CSAIL Collaboration. They presented their work at the 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e565cc0-7fff-cbe0-c9eb-bc35383dc425"&gt;Diffusion models like OpenAI’s DALL-E are becoming increasingly useful in helping brainstorm new designs. Humans can prompt these systems to generate an image, create a video, or refine a blueprint, and come back with ideas they hadn’t considered before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did you know that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models are also making headway in creating working robots?&amp;nbsp;Recent diffusion-based approaches have generated structures and the systems that control them from scratch. With or without a user’s input, these models can make new designs and then evaluate them in simulation before they’re fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new approach from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) applies this generative know-how toward improving humans’ robotic designs. Users can draft a 3D model of a robot and specify which parts they’d like to see a diffusion model modify, providing its dimensions beforehand. GenAI then brainstorms the optimal shape for these areas and tests its ideas in simulation. When the system finds the right design, you can save and then fabricate a working, real-world robot with a 3D printer, without requiring additional tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used this approach to create a robot that leaps up an average of roughly 2 feet, or 41 percent higher than a similar machine they created on their own. The machines are nearly identical in appearance: They’re both made of a type of plastic called polylactic acid, and while they initially appear flat, they spring up into a diamond shape when a motor pulls on the cord attached to them. So what exactly did AI do differently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer look reveals that the AI-generated linkages are curved, and resemble thick drumsticks (the musical instrument drummers use), whereas the standard robot’s connecting parts are straight and rectangular.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Leveraging the strengths of two world-class research institutions, MIT and Mass General Brigham (MGB) recently celebrated the launch of the MIT-MGB Seed Program. The new initiative, which is supported by Analog Devices Inc. (ADI), will fund joint research projects led by researchers at MIT and Mass General Brigham. These collaborative projects will advance research in human health, with the goal of developing next-generation therapies, diagnostics, and digital tools that can improve lives at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program represents a unique opportunity to dramatically accelerate innovations that address some of the most urgent challenges in human health. By supporting interdisciplinary teams from MIT and Mass General Brigham, including both researchers and clinicians, the seed program will foster groundbreaking work that brings together expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and measurement and sensing technologies with pioneering clinical research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The power of this program&amp;nbsp;is that it&amp;nbsp;combines MIT’s strength in science, engineering, and innovation with Mass General Brigham’s world-class scientific and clinical research. With the support and incentive to work together, researchers and clinicians&amp;nbsp;will have the freedom&amp;nbsp;to tackle compelling&amp;nbsp;problems&amp;nbsp;and find novel ways to&amp;nbsp;overcome them to&amp;nbsp;achieve transformative changes in patient care,” says Sally Kornbluth, president of MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIT-MGB Seed Program will enable cross-disciplinary collaboration to advance transformative research and breakthrough science. By combining the collective strengths and expertise of our great institutions, we can transform medical care and drive innovation and discovery with speed,” says Anne Klibanski, president and CEO of Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is funded by a gift from ADI. Over the next three years, the ADI Fund for Health and Life Sciences will support approximately six joint projects annually, with funding split between the two institutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The converging domains of biology, medicine, and computing promise a new era of health-care efficacy, efficiency, and access. ADI has enjoyed a long and fruitful history of collaboration with MIT and Mass General Brigham, and we are excited by this new initiative’s potential to transform the future of patient care,” adds Vincent Roche, president and CEO of ADI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to funding, teams selected for the program will have access to entrepreneurial workshops, including some hosted by The Engine — an MIT-built venture firm focused on tough tech. These sessions will connect researchers with company founders, investors, and industry leaders, helping them chart a path from breakthrough discoveries in the lab to real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program will launch an open call for proposals to researchers at MIT and Mass General Brigham. The first cohort of funded projects is expected to launch in fall 2025. Awardees will be selected by a joint review committee composed of MIT and Mass General Brigham experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to MIT’s faculty lead for the MIT-MGB Seed Program, Alex K. Shalek, building collaborative research teams with leaders from both institutions could help fill critical gaps that often impede innovation in health and life sciences. Shalek also serves as director&amp;nbsp;of the Institute for Medical Engineering &amp;amp; Science (IMES), the J. W. Kieckhefer Professor in IMES and Chemistry, and an extramural member of the&amp;nbsp;Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“Clinicians often see where current interventions fall short, but may lack the scientific tools or engineering expertise needed to develop new ones. Conversely, MIT researchers may not fully grasp these clinical challenges or have access to the right patient data and samples,” explains Shalek, who is also a member of the Ragon Institute of Mass General Brigham, MIT, and Harvard. “By supporting bilateral collaborations and building a community across disciplines, this program is poised to drive critical advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and AI-driven health applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emery Brown, a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, will serve alongside Shalek as Mass General Brigham’s faculty lead for the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIT-MGB Seed Program creates a perfect storm. The program will provide an opportunity for MIT faculty to bring novel science and engineering to attack and solve important clinical problems,” adds Brown, who is also the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at MIT. “The pursuit of solutions to important and challenging clinical problems by Mass General Brigham physicians and scientists will no doubt spur MIT scientists and engineers to develop new technologies, or find novel applications of existing technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT-MGB Seed Program is a flagship initiative in the MIT Health and Life Sciences Collaborative (MIT HEALS). It reflects MIT HEALS’ core mission to establish MIT as a central hub for health and life sciences innovation and translation, and to leverage connections with other world-class research institutions in the Boston area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This program exemplifies the power of interdisciplinary research,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, MIT’s chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of engineering, and head of MIT HEALS. “It creates a critical bridge between clinical practice and technological innovation — two areas that must be deeply connected to advance real-world solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program’s launch was celebrated at a special event at MIT’s Samberg Conference Center on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the numerous educational and startlingly insightful panel discussions on AI enterprise integrations featuring industry leaders at &lt;strong&gt;VentureBeat’s Transform 2025 conference&lt;/strong&gt; this week was one led by &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Platform Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Will Grannis &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Richard Clarke, Highmark Health’s Senior Vice President and Chief Data and Analytics Officer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That session, “&lt;em&gt;The New AI Stack in Healthcare: Architecting for Multi-Model, Multi-Modal Environments,”&lt;/em&gt; delivered a pragmatic look at how the two organizations are collaborating to deploy AI at scale across more than 14,000 employees at the large U.S. healthcare system Highmark Health (based out of Western Pennsylvania).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the collaboration has onboarded all these employees and turned them into active users without losing sight of complexity, regulation, or clinician trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how did Google Cloud and Highmark go about it? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-partnership-built-on-prepared-foundations"&gt;A Partnership Built on Prepared Foundations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highmark Health, an integrated payer-provider system serving over 6 million members, is using Google Cloud’s AI models and infrastructure to modernize legacy systems, boost internal efficiency, and improve patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What sets this initiative apart is its focus on platform engineering—treating AI as a foundational shift in how work gets done, not just another tech layer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richard Clarke, Highmark’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer, emphasized the importance of building flexible infrastructure early. “There’s nothing more legacy than an employment platform coded in COBOL,” Clarke noted, but Highmark has integrated even those systems with cloud-based AI models. The result: up to 90% workload replication without systemic disruption, enabling smoother transitions and real-time insights into complex administrative processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud CTO Will Grannis echoed that success begins with groundwork. “This may take three, four, five years,” he said, “but if your data is ready, you can run the experimentation loops and evaluations that make AI useful at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-proof-of-concept-to-daily-use"&gt;From Proof-of-Concept to Daily Use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 14,000 of Highmark’s 40,000+ employees regularly use the company’s internal generative AI tools, powered by Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Gemini models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tools are applied across a range of use cases — from generating personalized member communications to retrieving documentation for claims processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clarke highlighted a provider-side example involving credentialing and contract verification. Previously, a staff member would manually search multiple systems to verify a provider’s readiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, AI aggregates that data, cross-checks requirements, and generates tailored output — complete with citations and contextual recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What drives this high adoption rate? A combination of structured prompt libraries, active training, and user feedback loops. “We don’t just drop tools in and hope people use them,” Clarke explained. “We show them how it makes their work easier, then scale based on what gets traction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agentic-architecture-over-chatbots"&gt;Agentic Architecture Over Chatbots&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most forward-looking themes from the session was the shift from chat-based interactions to multi-agent systems capable of completing tasks end-to-end. Grannis described this as a move away from quick-response chat models toward task synthesis and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Think less about having a chat interface and more about saying: ‘Go do this, bring it back, and let me decide,’” Grannis said. These agents coordinate multiple models, potentially cascading across different functions—from translation to research to workflow execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highmark is currently piloting single-use agents for specific workflows, and the long-term goal is to embed these within backend systems to perform actions autonomously. This will reduce the need for multiple interfaces or connectors and allow centralized control with broader reach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-task-first-not-model-first"&gt;Task-First, Not Model-First&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both speakers emphasized a key mental shift for enterprises: stop starting with the model. Instead, begin with the task and select or orchestrate models accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, Highmark uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for long, research-intensive queries and Gemini Flash for quick, real-time interactions. In some cases, even classic deterministic models are used when they better suit the task—such as translating patient communications into multiple languages. As Grannis put it, “Your business processes are your IP. Think about fulfilling a task, and orchestrate models to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support this flexibility, Google Cloud is investing in model-routing capabilities and open standards. The recent Agent Protocol initiative, introduced with the Linux Foundation, is designed to promote interoperability and stability in multi-agent environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those looking to replicate Highmark’s success, the panelists offered concrete guidance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lay the foundation early&lt;/strong&gt;: Invest in data readiness and system integration now. Even if full AI deployment is years away, the payoff depends on early groundwork.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid building your own foundational models&lt;/strong&gt;: Unless your business &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; building models, it’s cost-prohibitive. Focus on orchestration and fine-tuning for specific use cases.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a platform mindset&lt;/strong&gt;: Centralize model access and usage tracking. Create a structure that supports experimentation without sacrificing governance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with tasks, not tools&lt;/strong&gt;: Define the outcome first. Then match it with the model or agent architecture that fits best.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure and share&lt;/strong&gt;: Internal adoption grows when employees see practical results. Track usage, capture success stories, and continuously update libraries of approved prompts and flows.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for action, not just information&lt;/strong&gt;: The future of enterprise AI is task execution, not static insight. Build agents that can trigger real-world actions safely and securely within your systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the partnership between Highmark and Google Cloud is still evolving, the progress so far offers a model for others in healthcare—and beyond—who want to build scalable, responsible, and highly usable AI systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Clarke summed up, “It’s not about flashy features; it’s about what actually helps people do their jobs better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise leaders who missed the session can take comfort in this: success in generative AI isn’t reserved for those with the biggest budgets, but for those with the clearest plans, flexible platforms, and the patience to build strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the numerous educational and startlingly insightful panel discussions on AI enterprise integrations featuring industry leaders at &lt;strong&gt;VentureBeat’s Transform 2025 conference&lt;/strong&gt; this week was one led by &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Platform Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Will Grannis &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Richard Clarke, Highmark Health’s Senior Vice President and Chief Data and Analytics Officer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That session, “&lt;em&gt;The New AI Stack in Healthcare: Architecting for Multi-Model, Multi-Modal Environments,”&lt;/em&gt; delivered a pragmatic look at how the two organizations are collaborating to deploy AI at scale across more than 14,000 employees at the large U.S. healthcare system Highmark Health (based out of Western Pennsylvania).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the collaboration has onboarded all these employees and turned them into active users without losing sight of complexity, regulation, or clinician trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how did Google Cloud and Highmark go about it? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-partnership-built-on-prepared-foundations"&gt;A Partnership Built on Prepared Foundations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highmark Health, an integrated payer-provider system serving over 6 million members, is using Google Cloud’s AI models and infrastructure to modernize legacy systems, boost internal efficiency, and improve patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What sets this initiative apart is its focus on platform engineering—treating AI as a foundational shift in how work gets done, not just another tech layer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richard Clarke, Highmark’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer, emphasized the importance of building flexible infrastructure early. “There’s nothing more legacy than an employment platform coded in COBOL,” Clarke noted, but Highmark has integrated even those systems with cloud-based AI models. The result: up to 90% workload replication without systemic disruption, enabling smoother transitions and real-time insights into complex administrative processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud CTO Will Grannis echoed that success begins with groundwork. “This may take three, four, five years,” he said, “but if your data is ready, you can run the experimentation loops and evaluations that make AI useful at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-proof-of-concept-to-daily-use"&gt;From Proof-of-Concept to Daily Use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 14,000 of Highmark’s 40,000+ employees regularly use the company’s internal generative AI tools, powered by Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Gemini models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tools are applied across a range of use cases — from generating personalized member communications to retrieving documentation for claims processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clarke highlighted a provider-side example involving credentialing and contract verification. Previously, a staff member would manually search multiple systems to verify a provider’s readiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, AI aggregates that data, cross-checks requirements, and generates tailored output — complete with citations and contextual recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What drives this high adoption rate? A combination of structured prompt libraries, active training, and user feedback loops. “We don’t just drop tools in and hope people use them,” Clarke explained. “We show them how it makes their work easier, then scale based on what gets traction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-agentic-architecture-over-chatbots"&gt;Agentic Architecture Over Chatbots&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most forward-looking themes from the session was the shift from chat-based interactions to multi-agent systems capable of completing tasks end-to-end. Grannis described this as a move away from quick-response chat models toward task synthesis and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Think less about having a chat interface and more about saying: ‘Go do this, bring it back, and let me decide,’” Grannis said. These agents coordinate multiple models, potentially cascading across different functions—from translation to research to workflow execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highmark is currently piloting single-use agents for specific workflows, and the long-term goal is to embed these within backend systems to perform actions autonomously. This will reduce the need for multiple interfaces or connectors and allow centralized control with broader reach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-task-first-not-model-first"&gt;Task-First, Not Model-First&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both speakers emphasized a key mental shift for enterprises: stop starting with the model. Instead, begin with the task and select or orchestrate models accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, Highmark uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for long, research-intensive queries and Gemini Flash for quick, real-time interactions.
