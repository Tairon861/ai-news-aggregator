&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, and others are quietly scooping up and retaining user data to improve their models or monitor for safety and security, even in some enterprise contexts where companies assume their information is off limits. For highly regulated industries or companies building on the frontier, that gray area could be a dealbreaker. Fears about where data goes, who can see it, and how it might be used are slowing AI adoption in sectors like healthcare, finance, and government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Enter San Francisco-based startup Confident Security, which aims to be “the Signal for AI.” The company’s product, CONFSEC, is an end-to-end encryption tool that wraps around foundational models, guaranteeing that prompts and metadata can’t be stored, seen, or used for AI training, even by the model provider or any third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The second that you give up your data to someone else, you’ve essentially reduced your privacy,” Jonathan Mortensen, founder and CEO of Confident Security, told TechCrunch. “And our product’s goal is to remove that trade-off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Confident Security came out of stealth on Thursday with $4.2 million in seed funding from Decibel, South Park Commons, Ex Ante, and Swyx, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The company wants to serve as an intermediary vendor between AI vendors and their customers — like hyperscalers, governments, and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even AI companies could see the value in offering Confident Security’s tool to enterprise clients as a way to unlock that market, said Mortensen. He added that CONFSEC is also well-suited for new AI browsers hitting the market, like Perplexity’s recently released Comet, to give customers guarantees that their sensitive data isn’t being stored on a server somewhere that the company or bad actors could access, or that their work-related prompts aren’t being used to “train AI to do your job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CONFSEC is modeled after Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) architecture, which Mortensen says “is 10x better than anything out there in terms of guaranteeing that Apple cannot see your data” when it runs certain AI tasks securely in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like Apple’s PCC, Confident Security’s system works by first anonymizing data by encrypting and routing it through services like Cloudflare or Fastly, so servers never see the original source or content. Next, it uses advanced encryption that only allows decryption under strict conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So you can say you’re only allowed to decrypt this if you are not going to log the data, and you’re not going to use it for training, and you’re not going to let anyone see it,” Mortensen said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, the software running the AI inference is publicly logged and open to review so that experts can verify its guarantees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Confident Security is ahead of the curve in recognizing that the future of AI depends on trust built into the infrastructure itself,” Jess Leão, partner at Decibel, said in a statement. “Without solutions like this, many enterprises simply can’t move forward with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s still early days for the year-old company, but Mortensen said CONFSEC has been tested, externally audited, and is production-ready. The team is in talks with banks, browsers, and search engines, among other potential clients, to add CONFSEC to their infrastructure stacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You bring the AI, we bring the privacy,” said Mortensen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jonathan-Mortensen-Headshot.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As consumers, businesses, and governments flock to the promise of cheap, fast, and seemingly magical AI tools, one question keeps getting in the way: How do I keep my data private?&lt;/p&gt;

The new update includes a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news comes a couple days after Mistral released Voxtral, its first open source AI audio model that’s capable of reasoning in multiple languages, transcription, and more. Voxtral is also available via Le Chat.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mistral says its new deep research mode, like those offered by rivals, turns Le Chat into a coordinated research assistant that can plan, clarify your needs, search, and synthesize data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What the model does is really go and look into a big variety of sources on the web to answer a specific question,” Mistral’s head of product, Elisa Salamanca, told TechCrunch. “We believe this feature is going to be very relevant for both consumer and enterprise use cases. For consumers, because it can research travel and provide an exhaustive analysis of the best travel plans. And for enterprise work, it can do exhaustive research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the updates are available across all tiers — Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise — Salamanca notes that Mistral is focusing on integrating Le Chat and Mistral’s productivity suite into enterprise ecosystems with this release. That’s in large part because Mistral handles data connectors differently than competitors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of customers who have very sensitive data don’t actually use cloud services, or if they do, they do it on their own premises with virtual private clouds,” Salamanca said, citing customers in banking, defense, and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this, Salamanca said Mistral’s Le Chat and productivity suite connect to enterprise data on-premises. In other words, companies can use Le Chat’s deep reasoning and other capabilities to analyze their own internal data without having to upload anything to the cloud. That’s a meaningful differentiator against cloud-native LLM platforms like OpenAI, which is Azure-hosted, and Gemini, which is Google Cloud-based. It also opens the door for Mistral to offer other productivity tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A big part of our value proposition, especially when we release Le Chat Enterprise, is that we want to make [things like] Microsoft Excel and Google Docs and that kind of office suite work seamlessly with our capabilities,” Salamanca said. “So the connectors that we release with Le Chat Enterprise are actually one step in that direction. We’re building these connectors internally because we believe this is going to be a key for using Le Chat as a productivity enabler in the business context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from deep reasoning, Le Chat has gotten other updates today. While users have been able to use Le Chat to reason through complex questions via Magistral, Mistral’s new reasoning AI model, that capability was previously only available in English. Now Mistral natively supports multilingual reasoning in languages like French, Spanish, Japanese, and others. Mistral says Le Chat can also code-switch between languages midsentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This latest update from Mistral also includes the addition of Projects, which helps users stay organized by grouping chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces. Each project can have its own default library and remember which tools and settings a user has enabled. Mistral says use cases include planning a move, designing a new product feature, or keeping work-related projects on track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, Le Chat is getting improved image-editing capabilities. This allows users to create and edit images with prompts like “remove the object” or “place me in another city.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new features put Mistral in a more competitive range with the AI industry’s frontrunners, positioning Le Chat as not just a model demo, but also a full-stack contender.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2147859992-e1713960898378.webp?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;French AI lab Mistral introduced a range of new features to its Le Chat chatbot on Thursday that bring it closer to the capabilities of rivals like OpenAI and Google.

After burning through US$46 billion on the metaverse with little to show for it, the Meta CEO is now doubling down with an even more ambitious wager: superintelligence AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, however, the stakes are higher, the competition more fierce, and the potential rewards more transformative than anything Meta has attempted before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nine-figure compensation packages and infrastructure investments that dwarf even the metaverse spending spree, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence AI gamble represents Silicon Valley’s most expensive talent war – one that could either cement Meta’s position as a tech giant or become another cautionary tale of visionary ambition meeting harsh reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The birth of Meta Superintelligence Labs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs marks a shift for the social media giant. In an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;‘s TITV live-streaming programme, Zuckerberg told founder Jessica Lessin that “the most exciting thing this year is that we’re starting to see early glimpses of self-improvement with the models, which means that developing super intelligence is now in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision has driven the company to restructure its entire AI division, with the ambitious goal of delivering what Zuckerberg calls “personal super intelligence to everyone in the world.” The lab’s creation follows a period of internal struggles in Meta’s AI division, including management struggles, employee churn, and product releases that fell flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than incrementally improving existing systems, Zuckerberg has opted for a complete overhaul, bringing in external leadership and re-imagining the company’s approach to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are we witnessing the most expensive talent war in tech history?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Meta’s superintelligence AI ambitions is a talent acquisition strategy that has sent shockwaves through the industry. Zuckerberg has embarked on a spending spree to create the new lab, offering as much as nine-figure pay packages to hire top researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google, Apple and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin questioned reports of US$100-200 million compensation packages, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive nature of the market, stating that “a lot of the specifics that have been reported aren’t accurate by themselves. But it is a very hot market… there’s a small number of researchers, who are the best, who are in demand by all of the different labs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI talent acquisition strategy extends beyond financial incentives. Zuckerberg said having “basically the most compute per researcher is a strategic advantage, not just for doing the work, but for attracting the best people.” The approach reflects an understanding that in the superintelligence AI race, talent density matters more than team size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Alexandr Wang acquisition: A US$14.3b gamble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of Meta’s talent strategy was its acquisition of Scale AI leadership. In June, the company made a US$14.3 billion investment in the AI startup, founded and led by Wang. Under the deal, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, and Wang and a team of top Scale employees joined Meta in leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At just 28 years old, Alexandr Wang now serves as Meta’s chief AI officer, leading what the company has renamed “Meta Superintelligence Labs.” In the larger AI division, Wang has led a team of around a dozen newly-hired researchers, a handful of his deputies from Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, the former chief executive of GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of Wang’s team as a re-imagining of how Meta approaches AI development. The group is working in an office space siloed from the rest of the company and next to Zuckerberg, highlighting the importance placed on the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A philosophical shift: From open source to closed development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant development emerging from Meta Superintelligence Labs is a potential abandonment of the company’s long-standing open-source philosophy. Last week, a small group of top members of the lab, including Wang, discussed abandoning the company’s most powerful open source AI model, called Behemoth, in favour of developing a closed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a departure from Meta’s historical approach. For years, Meta has chosen to open source its AI models, making code public for other developers to build on. Meta executives have argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that AI development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift reflects concerns about competitive positioning in the AI race. Meta had finished feeding data into its Behemoth model (training) but has delayed its release because of poor internal performance. The setback has prompted a serious reconsideration of the company’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure as a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond talent acquisition, Meta is making infrastructure investments to support its superintelligence ambitions. Zuckerberg revealed that the company is “building multiple, multi-gigawatt data centres” and pioneering new construction methods, including “weatherproof tents” to accelerate deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of these investments is staggering. Hyperion, one of Meta’s new data centres, “is going to scale up to five gigawatts over the coming years” and “the size of the site covers a significant portion of the footprint of Manhattan in terms of space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure spending is enabled by Meta’s strong financial position, with Zuckerberg noting that “we can basically do this all funded from the cash flow of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The personal superintelligence vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Meta’s approach from competitors is its focus on “personal superintelligence” rather than centralised AI systems. During his interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin, Zuckerberg explained that while other labs focus on “wanting to automate all of the economically productive work in society,” Meta’s vision centres on “what are the things that people care about in their own lives… relationships and culture and creativity and having fun and enjoying life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends to Meta’s hardware ambitions, particularly its AR glasses initiative. In the same TITV interview, Zuckerberg predicted that “if you don’t have AI glasses, you’re going to be at a cognitive disadvantage” and described future scenarios where AI companions could “observe what’s going on in your life and be able to follow up on things for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications and competitive dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of Meta’s superintelligence push extend beyond the company. Meta’s AI talent acquisition strategy has created salary inflation in the industry, forcing competitors to match or exceed Meta’s compensation levels to retain their researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his interactions with competitors at Sun Valley, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive landscape, stating that “we’re not trying to target anyone individually. I want to make sure that I get to know all of the top researchers in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic approach masks what is fundamentally a zero-sum competition for a finite pool of top-tier superintelligence AI talent. The potential shift away from open-source development also signals a broader industry trend toward more proprietary approaches to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: A defining moment for Meta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s superintelligence initiative represents a re-imagining of the company’s future. After the costly metaverse experiment failed to deliver results, Zuckerberg is betting even bigger on AI, with investments that could exceed US$100 billion over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of Meta Superintelligence Labs will likely determine not just the company’s future but the trajectory of the broader AI industry. With some employees expecting “an exodus of AI talent who were not chosen to join Wang’s superintelligence team,” the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Meta’s AI talent acquisition campaign will yield the breakthrough technologies Zuckerberg envisions remains to be seen.

After burning through US$46 billion on the metaverse with little to show for it, the Meta CEO is now doubling down with an even more ambitious wager: superintelligence AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, however, the stakes are higher, the competition more fierce, and the potential rewards more transformative than anything Meta has attempted before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nine-figure compensation packages and infrastructure investments that dwarf even the metaverse spending spree, Zuckerberg’s superintelligence AI gamble represents Silicon Valley’s most expensive talent war – one that could either cement Meta’s position as a tech giant or become another cautionary tale of visionary ambition meeting harsh reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The birth of Meta Superintelligence Labs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs marks a shift for the social media giant. In an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;‘s TITV live-streaming programme, Zuckerberg told founder Jessica Lessin that “the most exciting thing this year is that we’re starting to see early glimpses of self-improvement with the models, which means that developing super intelligence is now in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision has driven the company to restructure its entire AI division, with the ambitious goal of delivering what Zuckerberg calls “personal super intelligence to everyone in the world.” The lab’s creation follows a period of internal struggles in Meta’s AI division, including management struggles, employee churn, and product releases that fell flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than incrementally improving existing systems, Zuckerberg has opted for a complete overhaul, bringing in external leadership and re-imagining the company’s approach to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are we witnessing the most expensive talent war in tech history?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Meta’s superintelligence AI ambitions is a talent acquisition strategy that has sent shockwaves through the industry. Zuckerberg has embarked on a spending spree to create the new lab, offering as much as nine-figure pay packages to hire top researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google, Apple and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin questioned reports of US$100-200 million compensation packages, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive nature of the market, stating that “a lot of the specifics that have been reported aren’t accurate by themselves. But it is a very hot market… there’s a small number of researchers, who are the best, who are in demand by all of the different labs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meta AI talent acquisition strategy extends beyond financial incentives. Zuckerberg said having “basically the most compute per researcher is a strategic advantage, not just for doing the work, but for attracting the best people.” The approach reflects an understanding that in the superintelligence AI race, talent density matters more than team size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Alexandr Wang acquisition: A US$14.3b gamble&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of Meta’s talent strategy was its acquisition of Scale AI leadership. In June, the company made a US$14.3 billion investment in the AI startup, founded and led by Wang. Under the deal, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, and Wang and a team of top Scale employees joined Meta in leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At just 28 years old, Alexandr Wang now serves as Meta’s chief AI officer, leading what the company has renamed “Meta Superintelligence Labs.” In the larger AI division, Wang has led a team of around a dozen newly-hired researchers, a handful of his deputies from Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, the former chief executive of GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of Wang’s team as a re-imagining of how Meta approaches AI development. The group is working in an office space siloed from the rest of the company and next to Zuckerberg, highlighting the importance placed on the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A philosophical shift: From open source to closed development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant development emerging from Meta Superintelligence Labs is a potential abandonment of the company’s long-standing open-source philosophy. Last week, a small group of top members of the lab, including Wang, discussed abandoning the company’s most powerful open source AI model, called Behemoth, in favour of developing a closed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a departure from Meta’s historical approach. For years, Meta has chosen to open source its AI models, making code public for other developers to build on. Meta executives have argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that AI development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift reflects concerns about competitive positioning in the AI race. Meta had finished feeding data into its Behemoth model (training) but has delayed its release because of poor internal performance. The setback has prompted a serious reconsideration of the company’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure as a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond talent acquisition, Meta is making infrastructure investments to support its superintelligence ambitions. Zuckerberg revealed that the company is “building multiple, multi-gigawatt data centres” and pioneering new construction methods, including “weatherproof tents” to accelerate deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of these investments is staggering. Hyperion, one of Meta’s new data centres, “is going to scale up to five gigawatts over the coming years” and “the size of the site covers a significant portion of the footprint of Manhattan in terms of space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure spending is enabled by Meta’s strong financial position, with Zuckerberg noting that “we can basically do this all funded from the cash flow of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The personal superintelligence vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Meta’s approach from competitors is its focus on “personal superintelligence” rather than centralised AI systems. During his interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information’s&lt;/em&gt; Lessin, Zuckerberg explained that while other labs focus on “wanting to automate all of the economically productive work in society,” Meta’s vision centres on “what are the things that people care about in their own lives… relationships and culture and creativity and having fun and enjoying life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends to Meta’s hardware ambitions, particularly its AR glasses initiative. In the same TITV interview, Zuckerberg predicted that “if you don’t have AI glasses, you’re going to be at a cognitive disadvantage” and described future scenarios where AI companions could “observe what’s going on in your life and be able to follow up on things for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications and competitive dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of Meta’s superintelligence push extend beyond the company. Meta’s AI talent acquisition strategy has created salary inflation in the industry, forcing competitors to match or exceed Meta’s compensation levels to retain their researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his interactions with competitors at Sun Valley, Zuckerberg acknowledged the competitive landscape, stating that “we’re not trying to target anyone individually. I want to make sure that I get to know all of the top researchers in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic approach masks what is fundamentally a zero-sum competition for a finite pool of top-tier superintelligence AI talent. The potential shift away from open-source development also signals a broader industry trend toward more proprietary approaches to AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: A defining moment for Meta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s superintelligence initiative represents a re-imagining of the company’s future.

&lt;p&gt;Delta has become the first airline to announce that it is using AI to boost profits by personalizing pricing through a pilot program that for months has caused customers to pay different prices for the same flights based on their data profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics have warned that this use of AI goes beyond airline practices that charge people who book flights ahead less than people who book flights at the last minute—and could ultimately mean the end of cheap flights across the board if other airlines follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an earnings call last week, Delta Air Lines President Glen William Hauenstein confirmed that seats on about 3 percent of domestic flights were sold using the AI pricing system over the past six months. By the end of the year, Delta's goal is to boost that to 20 percent of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog has warned that while so-called individualized pricing could theoretically be used to lower prices for Delta customers, without public reporting on how the pricing works, it's impossible to know if it's fair or possibly violating federal laws that prohibit charging different rates based on protected classes, like sex or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often when it's used, "the best deals were offered to the wealthiest customers—with the worst deals given to the poorest people, who are least likely to have other options," Fortune reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, Hauenstein told investors that Delta's goal is to eventually get rid of static pricing entirely, Fortune reported, likely motivated even more today based on reportedly "amazingly favorable" results the airline has seen so far. Other airlines may follow its lead, as Delta made it clear to investors that even though the feature is still in a "heavy testing phase," it's&amp;nbsp;working to propel revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We like what we see," Hauenstein told investors on the earnings call. "We like it a lot."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Slover, general counsel for a digital rights group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, warned last fall that tailoring prices based on a customer's "identity, preferences, and situation" could lead airlines to collude to spike prices. His post suggested that Delta may be motivated to leave customers in the dark on their AI models while picking their pockets. So far, Delta has not confirmed when it may release public records showing the pricing variance occurring from its pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The very fact that Delta is saying that the early results of this intrusive pricing scheme 'show amazingly favorable results' says it all," Slover said in a statement provided to Ars. "They are increasing their profits, and those profits are coming from the consumers they are taking advantage of."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta has partnered with Fetcherr for the pilot. Fetcherr an Israeli company that "also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients" and plans to expand into other travel industries once its tech becomes established in the airline industry, Fortune noted. Slover expects that for companies wooed with tech like Fetcherr's, the proposition will be "irresistible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta declined Ars' request to comment, but a spokesperson told Fortune that the airline "has zero tolerance for discrimination. Our fares are publicly filed and based solely on trip-related factors like advance purchase and cabin class, and we maintain strict safeguards to ensure compliance with federal law."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senator vows to block Delta’s AI pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Slover, companies like Delta could vary prices using data like a customer's web-browsing activity, prior purchases, searches for products, or their "income, assets, debts, and financial condition and history." Looking at past purchases could reveal how much they're willing to spend on comparable items, while social data could indicate if, for example, a flight is urgently needed. Any of these data points could "indicate the consumer is more susceptible to sales-pitch puffery or pressure," Slover suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Delta's AI pricing could increase competition in the airline industry, Slover expects that companies using such pricing schemes are "all too likely" to be incentivized "to skew in the direction of higher prices" because of the AI pricing's lack of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Informed consumer choice is the engine that drives competition; because consumers won’t be as informed, and thus will have little or no agency in the supposed competitive benefits, they are more apt to be taken advantage of than to benefit," Slover said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta could face backlash as it rolls out individualized pricing over the next few years, Slover suggested, as some customers are "apt to react viscerally" to what privacy advocates term "surveillance pricing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company could also get pushback from officials, with the Federal Trade Commission already studying how individualized pricing like Delta's pilot could potentially violate the FTC Act or harm consumers. That could result in new rulemaking, Solver said, or possibly even legislation "to prohibit or rein it in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers are already scrutinizing pricing algorithms, Slover noted, with pricing practices of giants like Walmart and Amazon targeted in recent hearings held by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone wondering how to prevent personalized pricing that could make flights suddenly more expensive, Slover recommended using a virtual private network (VPN) when shopping as a short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term, stronger privacy laws could gut such AI tools of the data needed to increase or lower prices, Slover said. Third-party intermediaries could also be used, he suggested, "restoring anonymity" to the shopping process by relying on third-party technology acting as a "purchasing agent." Ideally, those third parties would not be collecting data themselves, Slover said, recommending that nonprofits like Consumer Reports could be good candidates to offer that form of consumer protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one lawmaker, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), has explicitly vowed to block Delta's AI plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Delta’s CEO just got caught bragging about using AI to find your pain point—meaning they’ll squeeze you for every penny," Gallego wrote on X. "This isn’t fair pricing or competitive pricing. It’s predatory pricing. I won’t let them get away with this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta has become the first airline to announce that it is using AI to boost profits by personalizing pricing through a pilot program that for months has caused customers to pay different prices for the same flights based on their data profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics have warned that this use of AI goes beyond airline practices that charge people who book flights ahead less than people who book flights at the last minute—and could ultimately mean the end of cheap flights across the board if other airlines follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an earnings call last week, Delta Air Lines President Glen William Hauenstein confirmed that seats on about 3 percent of domestic flights were sold using the AI pricing system over the past six months. By the end of the year, Delta's goal is to boost that to 20 percent of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Watchdog has warned that while so-called individualized pricing could theoretically be used to lower prices for Delta customers, without public reporting on how the pricing works, it's impossible to know if it's fair or possibly violating federal laws that prohibit charging different rates based on protected classes, like sex or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often when it's used, "the best deals were offered to the wealthiest customers—with the worst deals given to the poorest people, who are least likely to have other options," Fortune reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, Hauenstein told investors that Delta's goal is to eventually get rid of static pricing entirely, Fortune reported, likely motivated even more today based on reportedly "amazingly favorable" results the airline has seen so far. Other airlines may follow its lead, as Delta made it clear to investors that even though the feature is still in a "heavy testing phase," it's&amp;nbsp;working to propel revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We like what we see," Hauenstein told investors on the earnings call. "We like it a lot."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Slover, general counsel for a digital rights group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, warned last fall that tailoring prices based on a customer's "identity, preferences, and situation" could lead airlines to collude to spike prices. His post suggested that Delta may be motivated to leave customers in the dark on their AI models while picking their pockets. So far, Delta has not confirmed when it may release public records showing the pricing variance occurring from its pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;

OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, generate editable presentations and slideshows, and run code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool, called ChatGPT agent, combines several capabilities from OpenAI’s previous agentic tools, including Operator’s ability to click around on websites, as well as Deep Research’s ability to synthesize information from dozens of websites into a concise research report. OpenAI says users will be able to interact with the agent simply by prompting ChatGPT in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT agent is rolling out on Thursday to subscribers to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plans. To activate the tool, users can select “agent mode” in ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;ChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing ChatGPT agent—a unified agentic system combining Operator’s action-taking remote browser, deep research’s web synthesis, and ChatGPT’s conversational strengths. pic.twitter.com/7uN2Nc6nBQ&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 17, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent represents OpenAI’s boldest attempt yet to turn ChatGPT into an agentic product that can take actions and offload tasks for users, rather than just answering questions. In recent years, Silicon Valley companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have unveiled dozens of AI agents that have promised to do just that. However, these early version AI agents have proven to struggle with complex tasks, and they seem less compelling as products than the ultimate vision tech executives pitch around AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent is far more capable than its previous offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s new agent can access ChatGPT connectors, allowing users to connect apps like Gmail and GitHub so that the agent can find relevant information to your prompts. OpenAI says ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal, and it can use APIs to access certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI suggests that users can tap ChatGPT agent to “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” as well as “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” These kinds of capabilities requires ChatGPT agent to parse through websites, plan a course of action, and use tools — much more complicated tasks than OpenAI has previously tried to tackle with agents.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model underlying ChatGPT agent offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, according to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. That’s roughly double what OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini scored on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On FrontierMath, one of the hardest known math benchmarks, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent scores 27.4% when it has access to tools, such as a terminal for code execution. The previous state-of-the-art score comes from o4-mini, which scored just 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor. OpenAI has previously warned that agentic models could present more dangerous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a safety report for ChatGPT agent, OpenAI says it’s designated the model as “high capability” in biological and chemical weapon domains, which is defined in OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework as a model with the ability to “amplify existing pathways to severe harm.” OpenAI notes that it does not have direct evidence of this, but it’s decided to take a precautionary approach and activate new safeguards to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new safeguards for ChatGPT agent include a monitor that works in real time as users interact with the product. OpenAI says it runs a classifier across every prompt entered into ChatGPT agent, determining whether the request is related to biology. If so, OpenAI runs ChatGPT agent’s response through a second monitor that determines whether the content could be used to evoke a biological threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also says it disabled ChatGPT’s memory feature for this agent to prevent misuse. In other parts of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s memory feature allows the chatbot to reference information from previous user chats. However, OpenAI says bad actors could use the feature in ChatGPT agent to exfiltrate sensitive data through prompt injection attacks. The company says it may revisit adding the feature in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While ChatGPT agent sounds impressive, it remains to be seen how capable it truly is in the real world. Until now, agent technology has proven relatively brittle when interacting with the real world. That said, OpenAI says it’s developed a more capable model that’s able to deliver on the promise of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated with more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/openAI-spiral-rose.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is launching a new general purpose AI agent in ChatGPT, which the company says can complete a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, generate editable presentations and slideshows, and run code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tool, called ChatGPT agent, combines several capabilities from OpenAI’s previous agentic tools, including Operator’s ability to click around on websites, as well as Deep Research’s ability to synthesize information from dozens of websites into a concise research report. OpenAI says users will be able to interact with the agent simply by prompting ChatGPT in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT agent is rolling out on Thursday to subscribers to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plans. To activate the tool, users can select “agent mode” in ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;ChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing ChatGPT agent—a unified agentic system combining Operator’s action-taking remote browser, deep research’s web synthesis, and ChatGPT’s conversational strengths. pic.twitter.com/7uN2Nc6nBQ&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 17, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent represents OpenAI’s boldest attempt yet to turn ChatGPT into an agentic product that can take actions and offload tasks for users, rather than just answering questions. In recent years, Silicon Valley companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have unveiled dozens of AI agents that have promised to do just that. However, these early version AI agents have proven to struggle with complex tasks, and they seem less compelling as products than the ultimate vision tech executives pitch around AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent is far more capable than its previous offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s new agent can access ChatGPT connectors, allowing users to connect apps like Gmail and GitHub so that the agent can find relevant information to your prompts. OpenAI says ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal, and it can use APIs to access certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI suggests that users can tap ChatGPT agent to “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,” as well as “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.” These kinds of capabilities requires ChatGPT agent to parse through websites, plan a course of action, and use tools — much more complicated tasks than OpenAI has previously tried to tackle with agents.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model underlying ChatGPT agent offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, according to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. That’s roughly double what OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini scored on the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On FrontierMath, one of the hardest known math benchmarks, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent scores 27.4% when it has access to tools, such as a terminal for code execution. The previous state-of-the-art score comes from o4-mini, which scored just 6.3%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor. OpenAI has previously warned that agentic models could present more dangerous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has officially joined the premier league of global AI infrastructure — and it’s not starting small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS), leaders today unveiled Isambard-AI, the most powerful AI supercomputer ever built in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Secretary of State Peter Kyle was joined by leaders from across academia, industry and government, including Simon McIntosh-Smith, director of the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing, and Neil MacDonald, executive vice president and general manager  for Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s server business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as we press this switch to activate the UK’s most powerful supercomputer, we are embarking on Britain’s super future where AI contributes towards the delivery of better public services, greater public prosperity, deeper scientific discovery and stronger national security,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” Kyle said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The numbers back up Kyle’s statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 exaflops of AI performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5,448 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set to rank 11th worldwide on the latest TOP500 list of world’s fastest supercomputers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 10x faster than the next-fastest supercomputer in the U.K. More computing power than all other U.K. supercomputers combined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally for energy efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI gives U.K. researchers and businesses a once-in-a-generation leap in computing power. It’s a platform to accelerate breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-driven drug discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced climate modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large language models (LLMs) tuned to U.K. languages and laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by £225 million in government investment and built with NVIDIA, HPE, the University of Bristol and others, Isambard-AI signals a clear ambition: to lead in AI, the U.K. must lead in compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;A Turning Point for UK Science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel — the 19th-century engineer who reshaped Britain with railways, bridges and ships — Isambard-AI brings that same scale of ambition to AI research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like Brunel’s projects during his era, it moves fast. Having gone from conception to deployment in just under two years, including the construction of the modular data center in 48 hours, the supercomputer is already running live projects aligned with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nightingale AI:&lt;/b&gt; A sovereign, multimodal health foundation model trained on National Health Service (NHS) data to support earlier diagnoses and personalized care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BritLLM&lt;/b&gt;: A U.K.-developed LLM project supporting British languages like Welsh, alongside English, to promote inclusivity and better public service delivery in healthcare, education and public services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCL Cancer Screening AI&lt;/b&gt;: Developing the first scalable AI system for prostate cancer detection via MRI, aiming for faster diagnoses and tailored treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EIMCRYSTAL (University of Liverpool)&lt;/b&gt;: Using AI to search 68 million chemical combinations to discover greener, more sustainable industrial materials — reducing reliance on rare or toxic inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EgoAI (University of Bristol):&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to analyze recordings from wearable cameras and other smart devices to help people perform tasks better at home. This holds immense promise for assisting dementia patients in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Built Fast, Built Smart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you build a supercomputer in half the usual time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treated the project like a high-performance processor,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, director at BriCS. “We executed everything in parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelized project management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early procurement of critical hardware, particularly GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefabricated modular data halls shipped in and assembled in days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentless optimization of delivery timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground broke in June 2024. By June 2025, the full 5-megawatt system was live: built, tested and running at a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally on the Green500 list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered by NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, among the most efficient chips available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct liquid-cooling architecture from HPE packs 440 GPUs per cabinet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid cooling towers enable &amp;gt;90% dry, waterless operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entirely powered by zero-carbon electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineered with the potential to recycle waste heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall power usage effectiveness below 1.1, among the best ever achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has officially joined the premier league of global AI infrastructure — and it’s not starting small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS), leaders today unveiled Isambard-AI, the most powerful AI supercomputer ever built in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Secretary of State Peter Kyle was joined by leaders from across academia, industry and government, including Simon McIntosh-Smith, director of the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing, and Neil MacDonald, executive vice president and general manager  for Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s server business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as we press this switch to activate the UK’s most powerful supercomputer, we are embarking on Britain’s super future where AI contributes towards the delivery of better public services, greater public prosperity, deeper scientific discovery and stronger national security,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” Kyle said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The numbers back up Kyle’s statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 exaflops of AI performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5,448 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set to rank 11th worldwide on the latest TOP500 list of world’s fastest supercomputers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 10x faster than the next-fastest supercomputer in the U.K. More computing power than all other U.K. supercomputers combined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally for energy efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI gives U.K. researchers and businesses a once-in-a-generation leap in computing power. It’s a platform to accelerate breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-driven drug discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced climate modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large language models (LLMs) tuned to U.K. languages and laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by £225 million in government investment and built with NVIDIA, HPE, the University of Bristol and others, Isambard-AI signals a clear ambition: to lead in AI, the U.K. must lead in compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;A Turning Point for UK Science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel — the 19th-century engineer who reshaped Britain with railways, bridges and ships — Isambard-AI brings that same scale of ambition to AI research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like Brunel’s projects during his era, it moves fast. Having gone from conception to deployment in just under two years, including the construction of the modular data center in 48 hours, the supercomputer is already running live projects aligned with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nightingale AI:&lt;/b&gt; A sovereign, multimodal health foundation model trained on National Health Service (NHS) data to support earlier diagnoses and personalized care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BritLLM&lt;/b&gt;: A U.K.-developed LLM project supporting British languages like Welsh, alongside English, to promote inclusivity and better public service delivery in healthcare, education and public services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCL Cancer Screening AI&lt;/b&gt;: Developing the first scalable AI system for prostate cancer detection via MRI, aiming for faster diagnoses and tailored treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EIMCRYSTAL (University of Liverpool)&lt;/b&gt;: Using AI to search 68 million chemical combinations to discover greener, more sustainable industrial materials — reducing reliance on rare or toxic inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;EgoAI (University of Bristol):&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to analyze recordings from wearable cameras and other smart devices to help people perform tasks better at home. This holds immense promise for assisting dementia patients in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Built Fast, Built Smart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you build a supercomputer in half the usual time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We treated the project like a high-performance processor,” said Simon McIntosh-Smith, director at BriCS. “We executed everything in parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to this speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelized project management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early procurement of critical hardware, particularly GPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefabricated modular data halls shipped in and assembled in days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentless optimization of delivery timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground broke in June 2024. By June 2025, the full 5-megawatt system was live: built, tested and running at a global scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;World-Class Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isambard-AI is not just fast — it’s green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranked fourth globally on the Green500 list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered by NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, among the most efficient chips available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct liquid-cooling architecture from HPE packs 440 GPUs per cabinet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid cooling towers enable &amp;gt;90% dry, waterless operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entirely powered by zero-carbon electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineered with the potential to recycle waste heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall power usage effectiveness below 1.1, among the best ever achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a USB stick, onto which he has loaded a couple of his favorite open-weight LLMs—models that have been shared publicly by their creators and that can, in principle, be downloaded and run with local hardware. If human civilization should ever collapse, Willison plans to use all the knowledge encoded in their billions of parameters for help. “It’s like having a weird, condensed, faulty version of Wikipedia, so I can help reboot society with the help of my little USB stick,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But you don’t need to be planning for the end of the world to want to run an LLM on your own device. Willison, who writes a popular blog about local LLMs and software development, has plenty of compatriots: r/LocalLLaMA, a subreddit devoted to running LLMs on your own hardware, has half a million members.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For people who are concerned about privacy, want to break free from the control of the big LLM companies, or just enjoy tinkering, local models offer a compelling alternative to ChatGPT and its web-based peers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The local LLM world used to have a high barrier to entry: In the early days, it was impossible to run anything useful without investing in pricey GPUs. But researchers have had so much success in shrinking down and speeding up models that anyone with a laptop, or even a smartphone, can now get in on the action. “A couple of years ago, I’d have said personal computers are not powerful enough to run the good models. You need a $50,000 server rack to run them,” Willison says. “And I kept on being proved wrong time and time again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might want to download your own LLM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting into local models takes a bit more effort than, say, navigating to ChatGPT’s online interface. But the very accessibility of a tool like ChatGPT comes with a cost. “It’s the classic adage: If something’s free, you’re the product,” says Elizabeth Seger, the director of digital policy at Demos, a London-based think tank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;OpenAI, which offers both paid and free tiers, trains its models on users’ chats by default. It’s not too difficult to opt out of this training, and it also used to be possible to remove your chat data from OpenAI’s systems entirely, until a recent legal decision in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI required the company to maintain all user conversations with ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google, which has access to a wealth of data about its users, also trains its models on both free and paid users’ interactions with Gemini, and the only way to opt out of that training is to set your chat history to delete automatically—which means that you also lose access to your previous conversations. In general, Anthropic does not train its models using user conversations, but it will train on conversations that have been “flagged for Trust &amp;amp; Safety review.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Training may present particular privacy risks because of the ways that models internalize, and often recapitulate, their training data. Many people trust LLMs with deeply personal conversations—but if models are trained on that data, those conversations might not be nearly as private as users think, according to some experts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Some of your personal stories may be cooked into some of the models, and eventually be spit out in bits and bytes somewhere to other people,” says Giada Pistilli, principal ethicist at the company Hugging Face, which runs a huge library of freely downloadable LLMs and other AI resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Pistilli, opting for local models as opposed to online chatbots has implications beyond privacy. “Technology means power,” she says. “And so who[ever] owns the technology also owns the power.” States, organizations, and even individuals might be motivated to disrupt the concentration of AI power in the hands of just a few companies by running their own local models.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Breaking away from the big AI companies also means having more control over your LLM experience. Online LLMs are constantly shifting under users’ feet: Back in April, ChatGPT suddenly started sucking up to users far more than it had previously, and just last week Grok started calling itself MechaHitler on X.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Providers tweak their models with little warning, and while those tweaks might sometimes improve model performance, they can also cause undesirable behaviors. Local LLMs may have their quirks, but at least they are consistent. The only person who can change your local model is you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, any model that can fit on a personal computer is going to be less powerful than the premier online offerings from the major AI companies. But there’s a benefit to working with weaker models—they can inoculate you against the more pernicious limitations of their larger peers. Small models may, for example, hallucinate more frequently and more obviously than Claude, GPT, and Gemini, and seeing those hallucinations can help you build up an awareness of how and when the larger models might also lie.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Running local models is actually a really good exercise for developing that broader intuition for what these things can do,” Willison says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Local LLMs aren’t just for proficient coders. If you’re comfortable using your computer’s command-line interface, which allows you to browse files and run apps using text prompts, Ollama is a great option. Once you’ve installed the software, you can download and run any of the hundreds of models they offer with a single command.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to touch anything that even looks like code, you might opt for LM Studio, a user-friendly app that takes a lot of the guesswork out of running local LLMs. You can browse models from Hugging Face from right within the app, which provides plenty of information to help you make the right choice. Some popular and widely used models are tagged as “Staff Picks,” and every model is labeled according to whether it can be run entirely on your machine’s speedy GPU, needs to be shared between your GPU and slower CPU, or is too big to fit onto your device at all. Once you’ve chosen a model, you can download it, load it up, and start interacting with it using the app’s chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you experiment with different models, you’ll start to get a feel for what your machine can handle. According to Willison, every billion model parameters require about one GB of RAM to run, and I found that approximation to be accurate: My own 16 GB laptop managed to run Alibaba’s Qwen3 14B as long as I quit almost every other app. If you run into issues with speed or usability, you can always go smaller—I got reasonable responses from Qwen3 8B as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you go really small, you can even run models on your cell phone. My beat-up iPhone 12 was able to run Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B using an app called LLM Farm. It’s not a particularly good model—it very quickly goes off into bizarre tangents and hallucinates constantly—but trying to coax something so chaotic toward usability can be entertaining. If I’m ever on a plane sans Wi-Fi and desperate for a probably false answer to a trivia question, I now know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the models that I was able to run on my laptop were effective enough that I can imagine using them in my journalistic work. And while I don’t think I’ll depend on phone-based models for anything anytime soon, I really did enjoy playing around with them. “I think most people probably don’t need to do this, and that’s fine,” Willison says. “But for the people who want to do this, it’s so much fun.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/llm-install2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s How To series helps you get things done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simon Willison has a plan for the end of the world.

 &lt;p&gt;“Running local models is actually a really good exercise for developing that broader intuition for what these things can do,” Willison says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Local LLMs aren’t just for proficient coders. If you’re comfortable using your computer’s command-line interface, which allows you to browse files and run apps using text prompts, Ollama is a great option. Once you’ve installed the software, you can download and run any of the hundreds of models they offer with a single command.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to touch anything that even looks like code, you might opt for LM Studio, a user-friendly app that takes a lot of the guesswork out of running local LLMs. You can browse models from Hugging Face from right within the app, which provides plenty of information to help you make the right choice. Some popular and widely used models are tagged as “Staff Picks,” and every model is labeled according to whether it can be run entirely on your machine’s speedy GPU, needs to be shared between your GPU and slower CPU, or is too big to fit onto your device at all. Once you’ve chosen a model, you can download it, load it up, and start interacting with it using the app’s chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you experiment with different models, you’ll start to get a feel for what your machine can handle. According to Willison, every billion model parameters require about one GB of RAM to run, and I found that approximation to be accurate: My own 16 GB laptop managed to run Alibaba’s Qwen3 14B as long as I quit almost every other app. If you run into issues with speed or usability, you can always go smaller—I got reasonable responses from Qwen3 8B as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you go really small, you can even run models on your cell phone. My beat-up iPhone 12 was able to run Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B using an app called LLM Farm. It’s not a particularly good model—it very quickly goes off into bizarre tangents and hallucinates constantly—but trying to coax something so chaotic toward usability can be entertaining. If I’m ever on a plane sans Wi-Fi and desperate for a probably false answer to a trivia question, I now know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the models that I was able to run on my laptop were effective enough that I can imagine using them in my journalistic work. And while I don’t think I’ll depend on phone-based models for anything anytime soon, I really did enjoy playing around with them. “I think most people probably don’t need to do this, and that’s fine,” Willison says. “But for the people who want to do this, it’s so much fun.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/17/1120391/how-to-run-an-llm-on-your-laptop/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:01:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Google hides secret message in name list of 3,295 AI researchers (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/why-it-takes-3295-people-to-write-one-google-ai-paper/</link><description>&lt;article class="double-column h-entry post-2106424 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-ai category-information-technology tag-academic-research tag-ai tag-ai-research tag-david-ha tag-gemini tag-gemini-2-5 tag-google-2 tag-google-deepmind tag-hardmaru tag-large-language-models tag-machine-learning tag-scientific-publishing"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;How many Google AI researchers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? A recent research paper detailing the technical core behind Google's Gemini AI assistant may suggest an answer, listing an eye-popping 3,295 authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a number that recently caught the attention of machine learning researcher David Ha (known as "hardmaru" online), who revealed on X that the first 43 names also contain a hidden message. "There’s a secret code if you observe the authors’ first initials in the order of authorship," Ha wrote, relaying the Easter egg: "GEMINI MODELS CAN THINK AND GET BACK TO YOU IN A FLASH."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled "Gemini 2.5: Pushing the Frontier with Advanced Reasoning, Multimodality, Long Context, and Next Generation Agentic Capabilities," describes Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash AI models, which were released in March. These large language models, which power Google's chatbot AI assistant, feature simulated reasoning capabilities that produce a string of "thinking out loud" text before generating responses in an attempt to help them solve more difficult problems. That explains "think" and "flash" in the hidden text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clever Easter egg aside, the sheer scale of authorship tells its own story about modern AI development. Just seeing the massive list made us wonder: Is 3,295 authors unprecedented? Why so many?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not the biggest, but still massive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 3,295 authors represents an enormous collaborative effort within Google, it doesn't break the record for academic authorship. According to Guinness World Records, a 2021 paper by the COVIDSurg and GlobalSurg Collaboratives holds that distinction, with 15,025 authors from 116 countries. In physics, a 2015 paper from CERN's Large Hadron Collider teams featured 5,154 authors across 33 pages—with 24 pages devoted solely to listing names and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CERN paper provided the most precise estimate of the Higgs boson mass at the time and represented a collaboration between two massive detector teams. Similarly large author lists have become common in particle physics, where experiments require contributions from thousands of scientists, engineers, and support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gemini development at Google DeepMind, building a family of AI models requires experience spanning multiple disciplines. It involves not just machine learning researchers but also software engineers building infrastructure, hardware specialists optimizing for specific processors, ethicists evaluating safety implications, product managers coordinating efforts, and domain experts ensuring the models work across different applications and languages.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;And complexity in AI model development has ballooned over a short period. Google's initial Gemini paper from 2023 included a "mere" 1,350 authors. That's a 144 percent increase in authorship headcount in under two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A collaborative future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, we wonder: Does the Gemini 2.5 paper show how modern AI research has become a massive team sport—one where traditional notions of authorship struggle to capture the collaborative reality of pushing the tech frontier, or is Google simply being unusually generous in granting credit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the astronomical author count trend in AI papers does not necessarily extend beyond Google. At competitor OpenAI, the company's o1 System Card lists 260 authors, and its GPT-4o System Card lists 417 authors. Numerous, no doubt, but not numbering in the thousands. The difference may come down to OpenAI being a smaller company, but also to management decisions about who gets their name on the list. Apparently, Google has adopted very inclusive authorship criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many authors on one paper, one might wonder if listing them all might muddy some part of the academic process. For example, should papers include everyone involved, even the guy who mops the floor in the server room? Such large author lists can blur the distinction between core contributors and peripheral participants, making it difficult to assess individual contributions. Additionally, with 3,295 authors who might naturally cite the paper in their future work, there's a risk of inflating citation counts in ways that may not accurately reflect the paper's scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one science blogger noted about large physics collaborations, "Papers simply do not have 5000 'authors.' In fact, I would bet that no more than a handful of the 'authors' listed on the record-breaking paper have even read the article, never mind written any of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not saying that all of those 3,295 people don't deserve credit, but it's a large and unwieldy number to chew. Meanwhile, AI projects continue to expand in complexity. In fact, if we keep seeing 144 percent increases in authorship numbers every two years, by 2040, Google's AI papers may have over 2.65 million authors. We'll need AI models just to read the author list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And complexity in AI model development has ballooned over a short period. Google's initial Gemini paper from 2023 included a "mere" 1,350 authors. That's a 144 percent increase in authorship headcount in under two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A collaborative future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, we wonder: Does the Gemini 2.5 paper show how modern AI research has become a massive team sport—one where traditional notions of authorship struggle to capture the collaborative reality of pushing the tech frontier, or is Google simply being unusually generous in granting credit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the astronomical author count trend in AI papers does not necessarily extend beyond Google. At competitor OpenAI, the company's o1 System Card lists 260 authors, and its GPT-4o System Card lists 417 authors. Numerous, no doubt, but not numbering in the thousands. The difference may come down to OpenAI being a smaller company, but also to management decisions about who gets their name on the list. Apparently, Google has adopted very inclusive authorship criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many authors on one paper, one might wonder if listing them all might muddy some part of the academic process. For example, should papers include everyone involved, even the guy who mops the floor in the server room? Such large author lists can blur the distinction between core contributors and peripheral participants, making it difficult to assess individual contributions. Additionally, with 3,295 authors who might naturally cite the paper in their future work, there's a risk of inflating citation counts in ways that may not accurately reflect the paper's scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one science blogger noted about large physics collaborations, "Papers simply do not have 5000 'authors.' In fact, I would bet that no more than a handful of the 'authors' listed on the record-breaking paper have even read the article, never mind written any of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not saying that all of those 3,295 people don't deserve credit, but it's a large and unwieldy number to chew. Meanwhile, AI projects continue to expand in complexity. In fact, if we keep seeing 144 percent increases in authorship numbers every two years, by 2040, Google's AI papers may have over 2.65 million authors. We'll need AI models just to read the author list.&lt;/p&gt;

ChatGPT now gets its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; PC? And it can use that PC to log into your, the human user’s, accounts and download or send stuff for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s correct, at least in a virtual sense, according to OpenAI. As the company explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The model can choose to open a page using the text browser or visual browser, download a file from the web, manipulate it by running a command in the terminal, and then view the output back in the visual browser. The model adapts its approach to carry out tasks with speed, accuracy, and eﬃciency.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-use-chatgpt-agent"&gt;How to use ChatGPT agent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can engage the agent by clicking on the ‘Tools’ button in the ChatGPT prompt entry box, opening the dropdown menu, and selecting ‘agent mode’ from the available options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014403" height="335" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-1.51.54%E2%80%AFPM-2.png" width="621" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, when it’s turned on describe a task in plain language, and the agent can carry it out across web and local app environments, combining reasoning with actions that previously only a human user could perform on their own machine, manually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent can connect to apps like your personal or business Gmail and GitHub, so it can pull in useful information — emails or code — from your accounts to help with tasks you ask it to do. It can connect to third-party application programming interfaces (API) to pull information and use connected applications and services through them, as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a website needs you to log in, you can do that securely through a special browser view, which lets the agent dig deeper and handle more personalized tasks, like checking your inbox or filling out forms on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-going-where-operator-could-not-offline"&gt;Going where Operator could not — offline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT agent builds upon and expands from the “Operator” agent OpenAI released in January 2025, which allowed ChatGPT to browse the web and fill out forms, place orders, and do other web-based tasks in a private “headless browser,” that is, a cloud-based custom web browser that OpenAI itself maintained and offered for each Operator session. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Operator was limited only to interacting with websites and web-based applications — not programs that could also run locally on a PC, such as spreadsheet tabulators and slide deck presentation making software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT agent can browse websites, interact with online forms, run code, analyze data, and deliver finished outputs — such as editable presentations or spreadsheets — based entirely on user instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unveiling comes on the heels of a report published days ago by independent subscription tech industry website &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggesting that OpenAI would upgrade ChatGPT to be a more direct competitor to its own investor Microsoft’s Office software applications (e.g. Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-merging-operator-and-deep-research-into-one-agent"&gt;Merging Operator and Deep Research into one agent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, OpenAI positions ChatGPT agent as a merging of two of its prior agents — Operator and Deep Research, the latter introduced in February 2025, which exhaustively searches the web through its own headless text-only browser to find and compile information into lengthy and in-depth reports (hence the name). As OpenAI writes in a blog post:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Operator couldn’t dive deep into analysis or write detailed reports, and deep research couldn’t interact with websites to refine results or access content requiring user authentication. In fact, we saw that many queries users attempted with Operator were actually better suited for deep research, so we brought the best of both together.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The previous Operator tool will be phased out, but users can still access Deep Research via the dropdown in the ChatGPT interface.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Whether using a visual browser to interact with a website or a terminal to run Python code, the agent moves seamlessly between tools within a single session.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It supports a broad range of use cases, from analyzing competitors and generating reports to planning trips, summarizing emails, or booking appointments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can interrupt, redirect, or pause a task at any time, with the agent picking up right where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability-and-access"&gt;Availability and access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting today, subscribers to ChatGPT’s $200-per-month “Pro” tier will have full access to ChatGPT agent, with a monthly quota of 400 messages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and Team ($30 per month) will gain access over the next few days, with 40 messages per month. Additional usage is available through credit-based options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI said in a release shared with VentureBeat under embargo that its ChatGPT Enterprise and Education subscribers will gain access to the feature the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the feature is not yet available in Europe or Switzerland, no doubt disappointing residents there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-built-with-safety-and-control-at-the-forefront"&gt;Built with safety and control at the forefront&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that the agent can now take actions on behalf of users — including on logged-in websites or with connected apps — OpenAI has introduced extensive safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include user confirmations before taking action, active supervision for sensitive tasks, and technical safeguards to limit unintended behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key protections include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation prompts&lt;/strong&gt; before actions like submitting forms or sending emails&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Mode&lt;/strong&gt;, which pauses execution when a user becomes inactive&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refusal of high-risk tasks&lt;/strong&gt;, such as financial transfers or privacy violations&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No memory retention&lt;/strong&gt; during agent sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-risk-domain-classification"&gt;High-risk domain classification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In line with its Preparedness Framework, OpenAI is treating ChatGPT agent as a &lt;strong&gt;High capability&lt;/strong&gt; system in the biological and chemical domains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no direct evidence of misuse, the company is activating its strongest safety safeguards out of caution. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include enhanced refusal training, red teaming by biosafety experts, and improved detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recall that Anthropic‘s recent information released about its new Claude Opus 4, and other surveys of advanced AI models, have shown that when given access to external tools and applications such as email, they can in some cases take actions they believe to be moral and ethical but that may compromise the user, such as emailing government agencies or journalists of suspected wrongdoing on the part of the user. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model thinks it is acting like a “whistleblower” but in fact, may compromise user privacy, security, and proprietary information and alert authorities to wrongdoing where there is none, or where it is dubious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strong-performance-on-real-world-tasks"&gt;Strong performance on real-world tasks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent isn’t just more capable in theory—it has delivered strong results across a number of benchmarks designed to simulate real-world knowledge work. It set a new high score on Humanity’s Last Exam with a 44.4 using parallel rollout methods, and achieved 27.4% on the difficult FrontierMath benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014394" height="449" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chart.png" width="490" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On SpreadsheetBench, it scored 45.5%—more than doubling Copilot in Excel’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-limitations-and-next-steps"&gt;Current limitations and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some features, like slideshow generation, are still in beta and may feel basic in formatting or differ slightly between in-app previews and exported files. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is actively training the next iteration of this feature to improve polish and layout. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent signals a shift in how users interact with AI—from asking questions to assigning complete tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its ability to reason, act, and produce deliverables, OpenAI is betting that users increasingly want AI not just to assist them, but to work for them. While the company emphasizes that the agent is still evolving, it sees this launch as the foundation for a more interactive, action-oriented future for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT agent isn’t just more capable in theory—it has delivered strong results across a number of benchmarks designed to simulate real-world knowledge work. It set a new high score on Humanity’s Last Exam with a 44.4 using parallel rollout methods, and achieved 27.4% on the difficult FrontierMath benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014394" height="449" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chart.png" width="490" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On SpreadsheetBench, it scored 45.5%—more than doubling Copilot in Excel’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-limitations-and-next-steps"&gt;Current limitations and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some features, like slideshow generation, are still in beta and may feel basic in formatting or differ slightly between in-app previews and exported files. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is actively training the next iteration of this feature to improve polish and layout. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch of ChatGPT agent signals a shift in how users interact with AI—from asking questions to assigning complete tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its ability to reason, act, and produce deliverables, OpenAI is betting that users increasingly want AI not just to assist them, but to work for them. While the company emphasizes that the agent is still evolving, it sees this launch as the foundation for a more interactive, action-oriented future for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We then ran a study that collected UWB radar data, along with electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) data as our ground truth for heart rate, using a setup that placed the UWB radar sensor in positions where users typically hold their phone, i.e., on a table in front of them or on their lap. Compared to the FMCW dataset, which was 980 hours of data, the UWB radar dataset was much smaller, with 37.3 hours. As the UWB radar configuration was close to what is feasible on a mobile phone, with a much lower bandwidth, its range resolution was far lower than the FMCW dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that our model was optimized to transfer to the UWB dataset, we retrained it after performing additional pre-processing steps to modify the mm-wave FMCW radar data to better resemble the target IR-UWB data, effectively lowering its range resolution. We then fine-tuned this model on the IR-UWB dataset, achieving an MAE of 4.1 bpm and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.3%, a 25% reduction over the baseline error rate. Our baseline for performance on UWB radar was 5.4 bpm MAE and 8.4% MAPE, achieved by selecting the best model trained from scratch on our UWB dataset. With transfer learning, we enabled the UWB radar to meet the Consumer Technology Association standards for heart rate measurement for consumer devices: an accuracy of up to 5 bpm MAE and 10% MAPE.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Or identify and close a cybersecurity loophole weeks before hackers strike? How about a team of AI agents equipped to restructure a global supply chain and circumnavigate looming geopolitical disruption? Such disruptive possibilities explain why agentic AI is sending ripples of excitement through corporate boardrooms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119946" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-2179705717.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although still so early in its development that there lacks consensus on a single, shared definition, agentic AI refers loosely to a suite of AI systems capable of connected and autonomous decision-making with zero or limited human intervention. In scenarios where traditional AI typically requires explicit prompts or instructions for each step, agentic AI will independently execute tasks, learning and adapting to its environment to refine decisions over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;From assuming oversight for complex workflows, such as procurement or recruitment, to carrying out proactive cybersecurity checks or automating support, enterprises are abuzz at the potential use cases for agentic AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to one Capgemini survey, 50% of business executives are set to invest in and implement AI agents in their organizations in 2025, up from just 10% currently. Gartner has also forecast that 33% of enterprise software applications will incorporate agentic AI by 2028. For context, in 2024 that proportion was less than 1%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s creating such a buzz – software enthusiasts seeing the possibilities unlocked by LLMs, venture capitalists wanting to find the next big thing, companies trying to find the ‘killer app,” says Matt McLarty, chief technology officer at Boomi. But, he adds, “right now organizations are struggling to get out of the starting blocks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge is that many organizations are so caught up in the excitement that they risk attempting to run before they can walk when it comes to deployment of agentic AI, believes McLarty. And in so doing they risk turning it from potential business breakthrough into a source of cost, complexity, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping agentic AI simple&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The heady capabilities of agentic AI have created understandable temptation for senior business leaders to rush in, acting on impulse rather than insight risks turning the technology into a solution in search of a problem, points out McLarty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a scenario that’s unfolded with previous technologies. The decoupling of Blockchain from Bitcoin in 2014 paved the way for a Blockchain 2.0 boom in which organizations rushed to explore the applications for a digital, decentralized ledger beyond currency. But a decade on, the technology has fallen far short of forecasts at the time, dogged by technology limitations and obfuscated use cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I do see Blockchain as a cautionary tale,” says McLarty. “The hype and ultimate lack of adoption is definitely a path the agentic AI movement should avoid.” He explains, “The problem with Blockchain is that people struggle to find use cases where it applies as a solution, and even when they find the use cases, there is often a simpler and cheaper solution,” he adds. “I think agentic AI can do things no other solution can, in terms of contextual reasoning and dynamic execution. But as technologists, we get so excited about the technology, sometimes we lose sight of the business problem.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of diving in headfirst, McLarty advocates for an iterative attitude toward applications of agentic AI, targeting “low-hanging fruit” and incremental use cases. This includes focusing investment on the worker agents that are set to make up the components of more sophisticated, multi-agent agentic systems further down the road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, with a narrower, more prescribed remit, these AI agents with agentic capabilities can add instant value. Enabled with natural language processing (NLP) they can be used to bridge the linguistic shortfalls in current chat agents for example or adaptively carry out rote tasks via dynamic automation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Current rote automation processes generate a lot of value for organizations today, but they can lead to a lot of manual exception processing,” points out McLarty. “Agentic exception handling agents can eliminate a lot of that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s also essential to avoid use cases for agentic AI that could be addressed with a cheaper and simpler technology. “Configuring a self-manager, ephemeral agent swarm may sound exciting and be exhilarating to build, but maybe you can just solve the problem with a simple reasoning agent that has access to some in-house contextual data and API-based tools,” says McLarty. “Let’s call it the KASS principle: Keep agents simple, stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The future value of agentic AI will lie in its interoperability and organizations that prioritize this pillar at the earliest phase of their adoption will find themselves ahead of the curve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;As McLarty explains, the usefulness of agentic AI agents in scenarios like customer support chats lies in their combination of four elements: a defined business scope, large language models (LLM), the wider context derived from an organization’s existing data, and capabilities executed through its core applications. These latter two rely on in-built interoperability. For example, an AI agent tasked with onboarding new employees will require access to updated HR policies, asset catalogs and IT. “Organizations can get a massive head start on business value through AI agents by having interoperable data and applications to plug and play with agents,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Agent-to-agent frameworks like the model context protocol (MCP) – an open and standardized plug-and-play that connects AI models to internal (or external) information sources – can be layered onto an existing API architecture to embed connectedness from the outset. And while it might feel like an additional hurdle now, in the longer-term those organizations that make this investment early will reap the benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The icing on the cake for interoperability is that all the work you do to connect agents to data and applications now will help you prepare for the multi-agent future where interoperability between agents will be essential,” says McLarty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this future, multi-agent systems will work collectively on more intricate, cross-functional tasks. Agentic systems will draw on AI agents across inventory, logistics and production to coordinate and optimize supply chain management for example or perform complex assembly tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conscious that this is where the technology is headed, third-party developers are already beginning to offer multi-agent capability. In December, Amazon launched such a tool for its Bedrock service, providing users access to specialized agents coordinated by a supervisor agent capable of breaking down requests, delegating tasks and consolidating outputs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But though such an off-the-rack solution has the advantage of allowing enterprises to bypass both the risk and complexity in leveraging such capabilities, the digital heterogeneity of larger organizations in particular will likely mean – in the longer-term at least – they’ll need to rely on their own API architecture to realize the full potential in multi-agent systems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;McLarty’s advice is simple, “This is definitely a time to ground yourself in the business problem, and only go as far as you need to with the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Agent, a new feature that lets the company's AI assistant complete multi-step tasks by controlling its own web browser. The update merges capabilities from OpenAI's earlier Operator tool and the Deep Research feature, allowing ChatGPT to navigate websites, run code, and create documents while users maintain control over the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature marks OpenAI's latest entry into what the tech industry calls "agentic AI"—systems that can take autonomous multi-step actions on behalf of the user. OpenAI says users can ask Agent to handle requests like assembling and purchasing a clothing outfit for a particular occasion, creating PowerPoint slide decks, planning meals, or updating financial spreadsheets with new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system uses a combination of web browsers, terminal access, and API connections to complete these tasks, including "ChatGPT Connectors" that integrate with apps like Gmail and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using Agent, users watch a window inside the ChatGPT interface that shows all of the AI's actions taking place inside its own private sandbox. This sandbox features its own virtual operating system and web browser with access to the real Internet; it does not control your personal device. "ChatGPT carries out these tasks using its own virtual computer," OpenAI writes, "fluidly shifting between reasoning and action to handle complex workflows from start to finish, all based on your instructions."&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Operator before it, the agent feature requires user permission before taking certain actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Users can interrupt tasks at any point, take control of the browser, or stop operations entirely. The system also includes a "Watch Mode" for tasks like sending emails that require active user oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Agent surpasses Operator in capability, OpenAI says the company's earlier Operator preview site will remain functional for a few more weeks before being shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance claims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI's claims are one thing, but how well the company's new AI agent will actually complete multi-step tasks will vary wildly depending on the situation. That's because the AI model isn't a complete form of problem-solving intelligence, but rather a complex master imitator. It has some flexibility in piecing a scenario together but also many blind spots. OpenAI trained the agent (and its constituent components) using examples of computer usage and tool usage; whatever falls outside of the examples absorbed from training data will likely still prove difficult to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For example, the ChatGPT Agent System Card shows that the agent can fail at complex tasks that require chaining together many steps in a novel way. In a "Cyber Range" evaluation, the agent was tasked with conducting a full-scale operation in a simulated network designed to mimic a small online retailer. When left to solve the problem on its own, the agent was unable to complete the task. While it could successfully perform initial research steps, like identifying servers on the network, it struggled to proceed beyond that and was unable to chain together the necessary exploits to reach the final goal. Even when provided with hints, the agent still failed (which in this case might be good, since it couldn't perform an automated hack), this demonstrates a clear limitation in its ability to solve complex problems that fall outside of its familiar training examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2106631 align-fullwidth"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      OpenAI writes, "The SpreadsheetBench authors used a Windows environment using Microsoft Excel to evaluate spreadsheets. We used an OSX environment and LibreOffice, which may result in small grading differences. For example, the authors found an Overall Hard restriction of 15.02% for GPT‑4o, and we obtained 13.38%. We used the complete 912-question benchmark."

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, OpenAI reports that ChatGPT agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on its own benchmark measurements, which should always be taken with a grain of salt until verified by impartial third parties. On Humanity's Last Exam, which tests AI performance on expert-level questions, the model scored 41.6 percent accuracy (compare that to OpenAI o3's 24.9 percent using tools). On FrontierMath, one of the most difficult math benchmarks yet devised, it reaches 27.4 percent accuracy with tool access (o3 with Python scored 19.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also claims the system outperforms humans on certain data science tasks like data analysis and modeling (such as creating forecasts or predictive models). On DSBench, a benchmark that seeks to measure that capability, ChatGPT agent scored 89.9 percent on data analysis tasks compared to 64.1 percent for humans, and 85.5 percent on data modeling tasks versus 65.0 percent for humans. The agent also scored 68.9 percent on OpenAI's BrowseComp for finding hard-to-locate web information and 45.5 percent on SpreadsheetBench for editing spreadsheets, which is higher than OpenAI's other AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that even though OpenAI says Agent can craft PowerPoint slide decks for users, the company acknowledged that slideshow generation is still in beta and outputs can feel "rudimentary in formatting and polish."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Safety and privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI admits that the launch introduces new security considerations. Because ChatGPT Agent can take direct actions on websites and access user data through connected services, it is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks—attempts by hackers to manipulate the AI's behavior through instructions that misdirect the AI model (in this case, likely through hidden instructions on web pages). For example, a site might have an invisible form field that instructs the AI model to enter your credit card information without your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says it has implemented safeguards against prompt injections by training the model to identify and "resist" these attacks while requiring user confirmation for consequential or suspicious-looking actions. The model is also trained to actively refuse high-risk tasks such as bank transfers. During a livestream on Thursday, one OpenAI engineer characterized Agent as a system of AI models working together, some of which constantly monitor the other models' behavior for suspicious activity. Those overseers can hypothetically halt a process if they spot a potentially dangerous scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for privacy, since Agent runs in a virtual machine on OpenAI's servers, users won't need to worry about the bot having access to local private data stored on their device. But what you feed into ChatGPT Agent could still be shared on the web during its operations. Beyond that, OpenAI says privacy controls for the new agent allow users to delete all browsing data and log out of active sessions with one click. When users take control of the browser in "takeover mode," OpenAI states it does not collect or store data entered during these sessions, including passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent launches today for ChatGPT Pro users, who receive 400 messages per month. Plus and Team subscribers will gain access over the next few days with 40 monthly messages. Enterprise and Education users will receive access in the coming weeks. The feature is not yet available in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've not yet used ChatGPT Agent ourselves, but we may follow up with our experiences at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI's claims are one thing, but how well the company's new AI agent will actually complete multi-step tasks will vary wildly depending on the situation. That's because the AI model isn't a complete form of problem-solving intelligence, but rather a complex master imitator. It has some flexibility in piecing a scenario together but also many blind spots. OpenAI trained the agent (and its constituent components) using examples of computer usage and tool usage; whatever falls outside of the examples absorbed from training data will likely still prove difficult to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the ChatGPT Agent System Card shows that the agent can fail at complex tasks that require chaining together many steps in a novel way. In a "Cyber Range" evaluation, the agent was tasked with conducting a full-scale operation in a simulated network designed to mimic a small online retailer. When left to solve the problem on its own, the agent was unable to complete the task. While it could successfully perform initial research steps, like identifying servers on the network, it struggled to proceed beyond that and was unable to chain together the necessary exploits to reach the final goal. Even when provided with hints, the agent still failed (which in this case might be good, since it couldn't perform an automated hack), this demonstrates a clear limitation in its ability to solve complex problems that fall outside of its familiar training examples.&lt;/p&gt;

      OpenAI writes, "The SpreadsheetBench authors used a Windows environment using Microsoft Excel to evaluate spreadsheets. We used an OSX environment and LibreOffice, which may result in small grading differences. For example, the authors found an Overall Hard restriction of 15.02% for GPT‑4o, and we obtained 13.38%. We used the complete 912-question benchmark."

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, OpenAI reports that ChatGPT agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on its own benchmark measurements, which should always be taken with a grain of salt until verified by impartial third parties. On Humanity's Last Exam, which tests AI performance on expert-level questions, the model scored 41.6 percent accuracy (compare that to OpenAI o3's 24.9 percent using tools). On FrontierMath, one of the most difficult math benchmarks yet devised, it reaches 27.4 percent accuracy with tool access (o3 with Python scored 19.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also claims the system outperforms humans on certain data science tasks like data analysis and modeling (such as creating forecasts or predictive models). On DSBench, a benchmark that seeks to measure that capability, ChatGPT agent scored 89.9 percent on data analysis tasks compared to 64.1 percent for humans, and 85.5 percent on data modeling tasks versus 65.0 percent for humans. The agent also scored 68.9 percent on OpenAI's BrowseComp for finding hard-to-locate web information and 45.5 percent on SpreadsheetBench for editing spreadsheets, which is higher than OpenAI's other AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that even though OpenAI says Agent can craft PowerPoint slide decks for users, the company acknowledged that slideshow generation is still in beta and outputs can feel "rudimentary in formatting and polish."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Safety and privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI admits that the launch introduces new security considerations. Because ChatGPT Agent can take direct actions on websites and access user data through connected services, it is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks—attempts by hackers to manipulate the AI's behavior through instructions that misdirect the AI model (in this case, likely through hidden instructions on web pages). For example, a site might have an invisible form field that instructs the AI model to enter your credit card information without your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says it has implemented safeguards against prompt injections by training the model to identify and "resist" these attacks while requiring user confirmation for consequential or suspicious-looking actions. The model is also trained to actively refuse high-risk tasks such as bank transfers. During a livestream on Thursday, one OpenAI engineer characterized Agent as a system of AI models working together, some of which constantly monitor the other models' behavior for suspicious activity. Those overseers can hypothetically halt a process if they spot a potentially dangerous scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for privacy, since Agent runs in a virtual machine on OpenAI's servers, users won't need to worry about the bot having access to local private data stored on their device. But what you feed into ChatGPT Agent could still be shared on the web during its operations. Beyond that, OpenAI says privacy controls for the new agent allow users to delete all browsing data and log out of active sessions with one click. When users take control of the browser in "takeover mode," OpenAI states it does not collect or store data entered during these sessions, including passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent launches today for ChatGPT Pro users, who receive 400 messages per month. Plus and Team subscribers will gain access over the next few days with 40 monthly messages. Enterprise and Education users will receive access in the coming weeks. The feature is not yet available in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've not yet used ChatGPT Agent ourselves, but we may follow up with our experiences at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

The problems, many of which have been aired on Claude Code’s GitHub page, seem to be concentrated among heavy users of the service, many of whom are on the $200-a-month Max plan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users are only told “Claude usage limit reached,” and given a time (typically within a matter of hours) when the limit will reset. But with no explicit announcement of a change in limits, many users have concluded that their subscription has been downgraded or that their usage is being inaccurately tracked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Your tracking of usage limits has changed and is no longer accurate,” one user complained. “There is no way in the 30 minutes of a few requests I have hit the 900 messages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When reached for comment, an Anthropic representative confirmed the issues but declined to elaborate further. “We’re aware that some Claude Code users are experiencing slower response times,” the representative said, “and we’re working to resolve these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The change has been alarming for users, who received no advance notice of the changes and no guidance on what to expect going forward. One user, who asked not to be identified, said it has been impossible to advance his project since the usage limits came into effect. “It just stopped the ability to make progress,” the user told TechCrunch. “I tried Gemini and Kimi, but there’s really nothing else that’s competitive with the capability set of Claude Code right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These problems have emerged alongside broader issues within Anthropic’s network. Many API users reported overload errors during the same period, and the company’s status page shows six separate issues during the past four days. Notably, the network still shows 100% uptime for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While loading errors are commonplace, Anthropic’s new approach to usage limits has caused significant confusion among users, many of whom were unaware they were subject to usage limits. Part of the confusion comes from Anthropic’s pricing system, which sets tiered limits without ever guaranteeing a set level of access. The most expensive Max plan, priced at $200 a month, promises usage limits 20 times higher than a Pro subscription. The Pro plan, in turn, offers limits five times higher than the free plan. But Anthropic says the free user limit “will vary by demand” and does not set an absolute value. The result leaves users unable to plan around usage limits, since they have no clear idea of when their service will be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $200 Max plan has been particularly popular among heavy users of the service, with some viewing the plan as unsustainable for Anthropic in the long term. The user we spoke to said the plan often allows him to make over $1,000 worth of calls (measured in API pricing) in a single day. As a result, he wasn’t surprised usage limits were becoming more restrictive — but hoped the company would communicate the changes more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Just be transparent,” he said. “The lack of communication just causes people to lose confidence in them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159671948.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Since Monday morning, Claude Code users have been hit with unexpectedly restrictive usage limits.

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since OpenAI introduced Deep Research, an AI agent that can &lt;span&gt;conduct research&amp;nbsp;for users and generate a comprehensive report, many other companies have released th&lt;/span&gt;eir own versions of this capability, all named Deep Research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Research, as a feature and product, can be accessed through various platforms, including Google’s Gemini, AlphaSense, You.com, DeepSeek, Grok 3 and many others.&amp;nbsp; Now, French company Mistral joins the fray with the launch of deep research capabilities into its Le Chat, among other updates to the platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, the company said Deep Research and other new features will make Le Chat “even more capable, more intuitive and more fun.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Le Chat users can open research mode and ask it something. The chatbot then asks questions to clarify some information and then begins gathering sources. It will put together “a structured, reference-backed report that’s easy to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistral said its research is powered by a Deep Research agent, which it designed to be “genuinely helpful” and feels like working with an organized research partner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdv6g4jFWAG9ncuRnmFB3H84SWHPdZYmrgP-f6OwavxUNRFCoxjcL25k5wGMvQ9w_jUuqEdAXHZTGi81IHDB0v4mh6h-Sc-JrZXkKrGUrul9qcE3S6rnQuZWZOPIR6z_g19hMGeAw?key=BGKUARn38KyygEUw77Uhpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Research has been called “the first mass market AI that could displace jobs,” especially since it can put out reports faster than human analysts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mistral also updated “thinking mode,” where Le Chat users can access the company’s chain-of-thought model Magistral, to read and respond in different languages. It can also code-switch mid-sentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prompt-based-image-editing-and-other-features"&gt;Prompt-based image editing and other features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people creating images on the chat app, they can ask the chatbot to edit parts of the photo with just a prompt. Users can say something like “generate a drawing of a cat,” then ask Le Chat to “place him in Istanbul,” and it will do just that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s ideal for making consistent edits across a series, keeping people, objects, and design elements recognizable from one image to the next,” Mistral said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the recently released speech recognition model, Voxtral, Le Chat can now support voice mode, where users can chat out loud with the platform. The company said this mode is best for low-latency speech recognition and keeping up with someone’s conversational pace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Le Chat’s new Projects feature allows users to organize related conversations and topics into groups. The projects will utilize their own libraries — which can include uploaded files — and retain tools and preferred settings. This is similar to Google’s NotebookLM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-playing-catch-up"&gt;Playing catch-up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the new features on Le Chat may seem familiar. It’s normal for other chat platforms to introduce similar features, especially as people begin to expect these capabilities when using chat systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, both Gemini and ChatGPT allow users to edit generated photos using a prompt. Sometimes, the chatbots misunderstand and redo the entire image. However, I recently generated and edited a photo with ChatGPT, and the chatbot removed exactly what I wanted it to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Voice mode has been available on ChatGPT since September 2024, though ChatGPT always included a “Read Aloud” feature. Project Astra from Google took voice mode to a new level, demonstrating in a demo that users can point out something in the physical world to Gemini and ask it to describe it out loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Mistral has the advantage of being Europe-based and can bring features directly to the European market. Companies like OpenAI often struggle to bring certain services, such as ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, to Europe due to data regulations and some provisions of the European Union’s AI Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this, users seemed excited that Mistral brought many new powerful features to Le Chat, with some early users seeing strong performance from Mistral’s Deep Research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since OpenAI introduced Deep Research, an AI agent that can &lt;span&gt;conduct research&amp;nbsp;for users and generate a comprehensive report, many other companies have released th&lt;/span&gt;eir own versions of this capability, all named Deep Research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Research, as a feature and product, can be accessed through various platforms, including Google’s Gemini, AlphaSense, You.com, DeepSeek, Grok 3 and many others.&amp;nbsp; Now, French company Mistral joins the fray with the launch of deep research capabilities into its Le Chat, among other updates to the platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, the company said Deep Research and other new features will make Le Chat “even more capable, more intuitive and more fun.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Le Chat users can open research mode and ask it something. The chatbot then asks questions to clarify some information and then begins gathering sources. It will put together “a structured, reference-backed report that’s easy to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistral said its research is powered by a Deep Research agent, which it designed to be “genuinely helpful” and feels like working with an organized research partner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdv6g4jFWAG9ncuRnmFB3H84SWHPdZYmrgP-f6OwavxUNRFCoxjcL25k5wGMvQ9w_jUuqEdAXHZTGi81IHDB0v4mh6h-Sc-JrZXkKrGUrul9qcE3S6rnQuZWZOPIR6z_g19hMGeAw?key=BGKUARn38KyygEUw77Uhpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Research has been called “the first mass market AI that could displace jobs,” especially since it can put out reports faster than human analysts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mistral also updated “thinking mode,” where Le Chat users can access the company’s chain-of-thought model Magistral, to read and respond in different languages. It can also code-switch mid-sentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prompt-based-image-editing-and-other-features"&gt;Prompt-based image editing and other features&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people creating images on the chat app, they can ask the chatbot to edit parts of the photo with just a prompt. Users can say something like “generate a drawing of a cat,” then ask Le Chat to “place him in Istanbul,” and it will do just that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s ideal for making consistent edits across a series, keeping people, objects, and design elements recognizable from one image to the next,” Mistral said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the recently released speech recognition model, Voxtral, Le Chat can now support voice mode, where users can chat out loud with the platform. The company said this mode is best for low-latency speech recognition and keeping up with someone’s conversational pace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Le Chat’s new Projects feature allows users to organize related conversations and topics into groups. The projects will utilize their own libraries — which can include uploaded files — and retain tools and preferred settings. This is similar to Google’s NotebookLM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-playing-catch-up"&gt;Playing catch-up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the new features on Le Chat may seem familiar. It’s normal for other chat platforms to introduce similar features, especially as people begin to expect these capabilities when using chat systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, both Gemini and ChatGPT allow users to edit generated photos using a prompt. Sometimes, the chatbots misunderstand and redo the entire image. However, I recently generated and edited a photo with ChatGPT, and the chatbot removed exactly what I wanted it to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Voice mode has been available on ChatGPT since September 2024, though ChatGPT always included a “Read Aloud” feature. Project Astra from Google took voice mode to a new level, demonstrating in a demo that users can point out something in the physical world to Gemini and ask it to describe it out loud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Mistral has the advantage of being Europe-based and can bring features directly to the European market. Companies like OpenAI often struggle to bring certain services, such as ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, to Europe due to data regulations and some provisions of the European Union’s AI Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this, users seemed excited that Mistral brought many new powerful features to Le Chat, with some early users seeing strong performance from Mistral’s Deep Research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
