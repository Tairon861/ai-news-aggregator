            &lt;p&gt;Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact, MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and “speak objects into existence,” creating things like furniture in as little as five minutes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the speech-to-reality system, a robotic arm mounted on a table is able&amp;nbsp;to receive spoken input from a human, such as “I want a simple stool,” and then construct the objects out of modular components. To date, the researchers have used the system to create stools, shelves, chairs, a small table, and even decorative items such as a dog statue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re connecting natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and robotic assembly,” says Alexander Htet Kyaw, an MIT graduate student and Morningside Academy for Design (MAD) fellow. “These are rapidly advancing areas of research that haven’t been brought together before in a way that you can actually make physical objects just from a simple speech prompt.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The idea started when Kyaw — a graduate student in the departments of Architecture and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — took Professor Neil Gershenfeld’s course, “How to Make Almost Anything.” In that class, he built the&amp;nbsp;speech-to-reality system. He continued working on the project at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), directed by Gershenfeld, collaborating with graduate students Se Hwan Jeon of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Miana Smith of CBA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speech-to-reality system begins with speech recognition that processes the user’s request using a&amp;nbsp;large language model, followed by 3D generative AI that creates a digital mesh representation of the object, and a voxelization algorithm that breaks down the 3D mesh into assembly components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, geometric processing modifies the AI-generated assembly to account for fabrication and physical constraints associated with the real world, such as the number of components, overhangs, and connectivity of the geometry. This is followed by creation of a feasible assembly sequence and automated path planning&amp;nbsp;for the robotic arm to assemble physical objects from user prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveraging natural language, the system makes design and manufacturing more accessible to people without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming.&amp;nbsp;And, unlike&amp;nbsp;3D printing, which can take hours or days, this system builds within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project is an interface between humans, AI, and robots to co-create the world around us,” Kyaw says.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine a scenario where you&amp;nbsp;say ‘I want a chair,’&amp;nbsp;and within five minutes a physical chair materializes in front of you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has immediate plans to improve the weight-bearing capability of the furniture by changing the means of connecting the cubes from magnets to more robust connections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also developed pipelines for converting voxel structures into feasible assembly sequences for small, distributed mobile robots, which could help translate this work to structures at any size scale,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;purpose of using modular components is to eliminate the waste that goes into making physical objects by disassembling and then reassembling them into something different, for instance turning a sofa into a bed when you no longer need the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Kyaw also has experience&amp;nbsp;using gesture recognition and augmented reality to interact with robots in the fabrication process, he is currently working on incorporating both speech and gestural control into the speech-to-reality system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaning into his memories of&amp;nbsp;the replicator in the “Star Trek” franchise and the robots in the&amp;nbsp;animated film “Big Hero 6,” Kyaw explains his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to increase access for people to make physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” he says. “I’m working toward a future where the very essence of matter is truly in your control. One&amp;nbsp;where reality can be generated on demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team presented their paper&amp;nbsp;“Speech to Reality: On-Demand Production using Natural Language, 3D Generative AI, and Discrete Robotic Assembly” at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF ’25) held at MIT on Nov. 21.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

After a period of eager experimentation, organizations are now confronting a more complex reality: While investment in AI has never been higher, the path from pilot to production remains elusive. Three-quarters of enterprises remain stuck in experimentation mode, despite mounting pressure to convert early tests into operational gains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1128742" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Concentrix-social-card-v2.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Most organizations can suffer from what we like to call PTSD, or process technology skills and data challenges,” says Shirley Hung, partner at Everest Group. “They have rigid, fragmented workflows that don't adapt well to change, technology systems that don't speak to each other, talent that is really immersed in low-value tasks rather than creating high impact. And they are buried in endless streams of information, but no unified fabric to tie it all together.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central challenge, then, lies in rethinking how people, processes, and technology work together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Across industries as different as customer experience and agricultural equipment, the same pattern is emerging: Traditional organizational structures—centralized decision-making, fragmented workflows, data spread across incompatible systems—are proving too rigid to support agentic AI. To unlock value, leaders must rethink how decisions are made, how work is executed, and what humans should uniquely contribute.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"It is very important that humans continue to verify the content. And that is where you're going to see more energy being put into," Ryan Peterson, EVP and chief product officer at Concentrix.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much of the conversation centered on what can be described as the next major unlock: operationalizing human-AI collaboration. Rather than positioning AI as a standalone tool or a “virtual worker,” this approach reframes AI as a system-level capability that augments human judgment, accelerates execution, and reimagines work from end to end. That shift requires organizations to map the value they want to create; design workflows that blend human oversight with AI-driven automation; and build the data, governance, and security foundations that make these systems trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"My advice would be to expect some delays because you need to make sure you secure the data,” says Heidi Hough, VP for North America aftermarket at Valmont. “As you think about commercializing or operationalizing any piece of using AI, if you start from ground zero and have governance at the forefront, I think that will help with outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early adopters are already showing what this looks like in practice: starting with low-risk operational use cases, shaping data into tightly scoped enclaves, embedding governance into everyday decision-making, and empowering business leaders, not just technologists, to identify where AI can create measurable impact. The result is a new blueprint for AI maturity grounded in reengineering how modern enterprises operate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"Optimization is really about doing existing things better, but reimagination is about discovering entirely new things that are worth doing," says Hung.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the webcast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webcast is produced in partnership with Concentrix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company plans to add new partnerships in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook’s “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI’s ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta AI is available in over 200 countries and can be accessed through the company’s apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as through the standalone Meta AI app.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2194278734.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta has signed commercial AI data agreements with news publishers to offer real-time global, entertainment, and breaking news on Meta AI, its AI chatbot. Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;

The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune, which also filed suit this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times’ suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit — filed even as several publishers, including The Times, negotiate deals with AI firms — is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers’ Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times’s copyrighted works.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times also claims Perplexity’s search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media, and now AI,” Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity’s head of communications, told TechCrunch. “Fortunately it’s never worked, or we’d all be talking about this by telegraph.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(Publishers have, at times, won or shaped major legal battles over new technologies, resulting in settlements, licensing regimes, and court precedents.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit comes just over a year after The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Times is also suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet’s articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has shot its own accusations at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times’ lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multi-year deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS made dozens of announcements, from new AI agents and updated large language models, to products with LLM and agent-building capabilities. AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to enterprise market share for actual AI models. AWS does have the advantage of having everything in house, including infrastructure and its own AI training chips.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Naveen Chhabra, a principal analyst at Forrester, told TechCrunch over email that while AWS announced a lot of cool new technology, it doesn’t change the fact that many enterprises aren’t ready to adopt AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AWS AI announcements show that AWS is thinking ahead and maybe far too ahead,” Chhabra wrote. “Most enterprises are still piloting AI projects and are rarely at the levels of maturity AWS expects them to be to take advantage of the offerings that come out of these announcements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A widely cited MIT study from August found that 95% of enterprises aren’t seeing a return on investment from AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ethan Feller, an equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told TechCrunch in a phone interview that the new Nova AI models, agents, and model-building capabilities weren’t what stood out to him as interesting from this week — despite these being the products AWS hyped the most. Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run AWS AI in their own data centers. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded $11.4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the&amp;nbsp;annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements&amp;nbsp;you may have missed thus far here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3817.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;If Amazon Web Services’ annual re:Invent tech conference proves anything, it’s that the cloud infrastructure player is going all in on AI. &lt;/p&gt;

I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded $11.4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users. However, Google’s Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in app, the firm found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over time, that increased pace of adoption could help Gemini narrow the gap with ChatGPT. That’s something OpenAI is now worried about, as its recent “code red” memo indicated. The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: Both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073348" height="438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Google Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the report noted that around two times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Over the past seven months (May-November 2025), Gemini increased its share of global monthly active users by three percentage points, the firm estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop three percentage points over the past four months (August-November 2025), by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Challenges from Perplexity and Claude may also be impacting ChatGPT, as both rivals saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with the former up 370% year-over-year, and the latter up 190%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073349" height="441" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT also saw its global downloads grow by 85% year-over-year as of November, but this lagged the overall cohort’s average growth of 110%. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, up 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, Gemini app users’ time spent in the app has more than doubled over the past few months, Sensor Tower said. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the popularity of its image generation model, Nano Banana, in September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame. Plus, ChatGPT users’ time spent was down 10% in November, compared with July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the current data indicates Google could be catching up with the market leader, much of its recent gains have to do with the success of Nano Banana. OpenAI could speed up growth again with the release of its own new products, if they make a similar impact. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT’s growth is starting to taper off, according to new data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and&amp;nbsp;Dan Siroker,&amp;nbsp;the co-founder and former chief executive of&amp;nbsp;Optimizely, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (not very well-received) AI pendant known as Friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We’re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We’re building a future that now seems inevitable. We’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: “We’re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.” The tech giant didn’t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Limitless will offer its customers a way to export their data, the company said, or users can choose to delete their data from within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup had raised more than $33 million in funding from investors, including a16z, First Round Capital, and NEA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS announced a wave of new AI agent tools at re:Invent 2025, but can Amazon actually catch up to the AI leaders? While the cloud giant is betting big on enterprise AI with its third-gen chip and database discounts that got developers cheering, it’s still fighting to prove it can compete beyond infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The funding round included different valuation tiers, these people said. Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s customer partners include Accenture, EY, Interpublic Group, and political campaigns. Last year, Aaru AI’s polling methodology accurately predicted the outcome of the New York Democratic primary, according to reporting by Semafor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The valuation increase follows Yoodli’s $40 million Series B round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. It comes after a $13.7 million Series A round announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently. The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Varun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Initially, Yoodli was meant to help people practice public speaking — a skill two out of three people struggle with, Puri told TechCrunch, citing internal data. However, the startup soon saw users turning to the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. That shift pushed Yoodli from a consumer-focused product to enterprise training, and it now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yoodli AI roleplays platform" class="wp-image-3073513" height="984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Yoodli’s platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Yoodli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the old world, companies would be training people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done,” said Puri. “But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Companies including Google, Snowflake, Databricks, RingCentral, and Sandler Sales use Yoodli for employee or partner training. The startup also sells its platform to coaching firms such as Franklin Covey and LHH, which can tailor the system to their own methodology and training frameworks, Puri stated. He added that the tool is not designed to replace human coaches but to keep a human in the loop delivering personalized guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I philosophically believe that AI can get you, let’s call it from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” said Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The platform works with multiple large language models, meaning users can run it with models such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s GPT based on their preference. Enterprises can also embed it into their existing software, or users can access it directly through a web browser. The AI supports most major languages, including Korean, Japanese, French, Canadian French, and a list of Indian languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yoodli does not offer a dedicated mobile app, a decision Puri said was made to avoid adding extra steps for users during training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yoodli team" class="wp-image-3073512" height="1280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Yoodli’s team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Yoodli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Puri did not disclose how many people use the platform but said most of Yoodli’s revenue now comes from enterprise customers. He added that between the Series A and B rounds, Yoodli saw a 50% increase in the number of role-plays run on the platform and in the total time users spent practicing. The startup also said it grew its average recurring revenue by 900% over the last 12 months, though it did not provide specific figures. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yoodli had not planned to raise more funding so soon after its last round but saw unanticipated investor interest, with WestBridge leading the latest raise, Puri said. He noted that strong performance metrics, key customers, and senior hires helped attract investors. The startup has recently hired former Tableau and Salesforce executive Josh Vitello as chief revenue officer (CRO), former Remitly CFO Andy Larson as CFO, and former Tableau chief product officer (CPO) Padmashree Koneti as CPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yoodli is not alone in the market for AI-based communication tools, but Puri told TechCrunch the startup differentiates itself through deep customization and a focus on specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their use cases and coaching methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Seattle-headquartered startup has about 40 employees. Puri said the latest funding will be used to expand Yoodli’s AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools, and to grow its presence in enterprise learning and professional development. The company also plans to hire across product, AI research, and customer success, and to expand into markets in the Asia-Pacific region while deepening its footprint in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Yoodli, an AI-powered communication training startup, has reached a valuation of more than $300 million — more than triple its level six months ago — as it builds technology meant to assist people rather than replace them with machines.&lt;/p&gt;
