          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is set to produce its own artificial intelligence chip for the first time next year, as the ChatGPT maker attempts to address insatiable demand for computing power and reduce its reliance on chip giant Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chip, co-designed with US semiconductor giant Broadcom, would ship next year, according to multiple people familiar with the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan on Thursday referred to a mystery new customer committing to $10 billion in orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s move follows the strategy of tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Meta, which have designed their own specialised chips to run AI workloads. The industry has seen huge demand for the computing power to train and run AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI planned to put the chip to use internally, according to one person close to the project, rather than make them available to external customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year it began an initial collaboration with Broadcom, according to reports at the time, but the timeline for mass production of a successful chip design had previously been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a call with analysts, Tan announced that Broadcom had secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chip business, as it reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom does not disclose the names of these customers, but people familiar with the matter confirmed OpenAI was the new client. Broadcom and OpenAI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tan said the deal had lifted the company’s growth prospects by bringing “immediate and fairly substantial demand,” shipping chips for that customer “pretty strongly” from next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect that custom AI chips will take a growing share of the booming AI infrastructure market has helped propel Broadcom’s shares more than 30 percent higher this year. They rallied almost 9 percent in pre-market trading in New York on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC analysts have recently noted that they expect to see a much higher growth rate from Broadcom’s custom chip business compared with Nvidia’s chip business in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia continues to dominate the AI hardware space, with the Big Tech “hyperscalers” still representing a significant share of its customer base. But its growth has slowed relative to the astronomical figures it saw at the start of the AI investment boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman has been vocal about the demand for more computing power to serve the number of businesses and consumers using products such as ChatGPT, as well as to train and run AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was one of the earliest customers for Nvidia’s AI chips and has since proven to be a voracious consumer of its hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Altman said the company was prioritising compute “in light of the increased demand from [OpenAI’s latest model] GPT-5” and planned to double its compute fleet “over the next 5 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre’s JUPITER — Europe’s first exascale supercomputer — is officially live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiled today at the supercomputer’s inauguration ceremony in Jülich, JUPITER is accelerating innovative applications that are out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powered by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform, it’s enabling breakthrough research in climate, neuroscience, quantum simulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture, JUPITER can run 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second and is expected to offer up to 90 exaflops of AI performance, delivering more than double the speed for high-performance computing and AI workloads compared with the next-fastest system in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JUPITER marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development,” said Thomas Lippert, director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. “As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture. A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz highlighted how the supercomputer is driving national advancement and industrial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Jupiter is the first European supercomputer, and the first outside the U.S., to have reached this level,” Merz said. “Together today, we are witnesses to a historic European pioneering project.”" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/merz-quote-pulled-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some exceptional numbers behind JUPITER, which 18 Germany-based and 15 European teams are among the first to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate science, including weather prediction and simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) for European languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuroscience, including for drug discovery and mapping the human brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum simulation, to bring quantum computing closer to reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along with many other disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre and a German consortium of nine European partners from research, industry and the media are tapping JUPITER for TrustLLM, a project that’s training the next generation of LLMs for various European languages. Such LLMs can ease workflows across virtually every industry by generating humanlike responses and improving productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience researcher Thorsten Hater at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre plans to use JUPITER to simulate the behavior of individual neurons on the subcellular level with the Arbor simulator. Such simulations will be crucial for developing therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JUPITER is poised to break the world record for a supercomputer’s ability to handle qubits, the basic units of information in quantum computing. A typical laptop’s memory can handle about 32 qubits. The current record on a supercomputer is 48 qubits. An exascale computer like JUPITER could surpass 50 qubits — a significant milestone for quantum simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Empowering European Researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany and beyond, JUPITER is powering Europe’s most challenging research initiatives, helping scale the continent’s AI leadership with optimal energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular dynamics simulation:&lt;/b&gt; The Max Planck Institute of Biophysics will use JUPITER to simulate the nuclear pore complex — the largest protein assembly in cells — to achieve atom-level insights, advance nuclear transport models and combat retroviruses like HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multilingual LLMs&lt;/b&gt;: With JUPITER, the University of Edinburgh will generate synthetic data to train LLMs that can reason over long documents in any language. More LLMs are being trained through the JUPITER Research and Early Access Program across Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Particle physics: &lt;/b&gt;The University of Wuppertal will use JUPITER to significantly increase the resolution of its microphysical computations, including to study the magnetic moment of an elementary particle, called muon, and potentially discover new particles and interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundation models for video: &lt;/b&gt;Using JUPITER, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich will develop spatio-temporal compression and diffusion architectures that enable the creation of high-quality, accessible video models to advance applications from medical imaging to autonomous driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal AI foundation models&lt;/b&gt;: The University of Lisbon will tap JUPITER to scale multimodal, multilingual, open language models — integrating concepts from machine learning, sparse modeling, information theory and cognitive science — so these LLMs can support all European languages and address the limitations of existing models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre’s JUPITER — Europe’s first exascale supercomputer — is officially live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiled today at the supercomputer’s inauguration ceremony in Jülich, JUPITER is accelerating innovative applications that are out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powered by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform, it’s enabling breakthrough research in climate, neuroscience, quantum simulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture, JUPITER can run 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second and is expected to offer up to 90 exaflops of AI performance, delivering more than double the speed for high-performance computing and AI workloads compared with the next-fastest system in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JUPITER marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development,” said Thomas Lippert, director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. “As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture. A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz highlighted how the supercomputer is driving national advancement and industrial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Jupiter is the first European supercomputer, and the first outside the U.S., to have reached this level,” Merz said. “Together today, we are witnesses to a historic European pioneering project.”" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/merz-quote-pulled-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some exceptional numbers behind JUPITER, which 18 Germany-based and 15 European teams are among the first to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips interconnected with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. 51,000 network connections let JUPITER transmit 3x more data than all global data traffic at any given moment. Nearly 1 exabyte of storage. 50 specialized containers comprise JUPITER’s modular data center. JEDI, one rack of JUPITER, is the No. 1 most energy-efficient supercomputer." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jupiter-infographic-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate science, including weather prediction and simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) for European languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuroscience, including for drug discovery and mapping the human brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum simulation, to bring quantum computing closer to reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along with many other disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre and a German consortium of nine European partners from research, industry and the media are tapping JUPITER for TrustLLM, a project that’s training the next generation of LLMs for various European languages. Such LLMs can ease workflows across virtually every industry by generating humanlike responses and improving productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience researcher Thorsten Hater at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre plans to use JUPITER to simulate the behavior of individual neurons on the subcellular level with the Arbor simulator. Such simulations will be crucial for developing therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JUPITER is poised to break the world record for a supercomputer’s ability to handle qubits, the basic units of information in quantum computing. A typical laptop’s memory can handle about 32 qubits. The current record on a supercomputer is 48 qubits. An exascale computer like JUPITER could surpass 50 qubits — a significant milestone for quantum simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Empowering European Researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany and beyond, JUPITER is powering Europe’s most challenging research initiatives, helping scale the continent’s AI leadership with optimal energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular dynamics simulation:&lt;/b&gt; The Max Planck Institute of Biophysics will use JUPITER to simulate the nuclear pore complex — the largest protein assembly in cells — to achieve atom-level insights, advance nuclear transport models and combat retroviruses like HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multilingual LLMs&lt;/b&gt;: With JUPITER, the University of Edinburgh will generate synthetic data to train LLMs that can reason over long documents in any language. More LLMs are being trained through the JUPITER Research and Early Access Program across Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Particle physics: &lt;/b&gt;The University of Wuppertal will use JUPITER to significantly increase the resolution of its microphysical computations, including to study the magnetic moment of an elementary particle, called muon, and potentially discover new particles and interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundation models for video: &lt;/b&gt;Using JUPITER, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich will develop spatio-temporal compression and diffusion architectures that enable the creation of high-quality, accessible video models to advance applications from medical imaging to autonomous driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal AI foundation models&lt;/b&gt;: The University of Lisbon will tap JUPITER to scale multimodal, multilingual, open language models — integrating concepts from machine learning, sparse modeling, information theory and cognitive science — so these LLMs can support all European languages and address the limitations of existing models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It offers an AI agent to solve a problem that data analytics products have struggled with for decades: The people who know how to run the big data infrastructure are not the ones who actually need to use the data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With LLMs, business managers can ask questions of their data in natural language. Isotopes’ agent, Aidnn, can provide answers and draft complex planning documents, gathering data from wherever it’s stored, like finance apps, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are countless agentic business analytics offerings out there, but Isotopes’ co-founders have a unique pedigree. Their product is so sophisticated, the startup has already applied for 10 patents, co-founder CEO Arun Murthy told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just over 20 years ago, when Murthy was in his mid-20s, he worked at Yahoo on the team that built an open source project called Hadoop. Hadoop spurred the initial Big Data frenzy of the 2010s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2011, Yahoo spun it out into a company called Hortonworks, with Murthy as co-founder and chief product officer. Just four years after launch, Hortonworks went public. But the rise of new cloud storage tech took its toll on Hadoop’s market, and Hortonworks eventually merged with its biggest rival, Cloudera. The merged company was taken private in 2021 after famed activist investor Carl Icahn got involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Murthy went to Cloudera for a few years during that turmoil, managing about 200 people. Yet, he says, even there he saw the age-old data access problem. He remembers quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts grilling execs on operating details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They couldn’t always answer because they didn’t have access to the data. “It was embarrassing,” he admits now. “We were a big data company selling this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2021, he left that job with no real plan on what to do next, and a VC introduced him to Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. After a few chats with Wang and a bit of consulting work, Murthy joined Scale as chief technology officer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was like “getting a PhD at Scale,” he describes. “Understanding what drives these models and how to improve them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But when his old buddy from Hortonworks, Prasanth Jayachandran, called him, the two decided to do their own AI startup. They persuaded their third-cofounder, Gopal Vijayaraghavan, also from the Hortonworks days, to join them&amp;nbsp;and in late 2024 founded Isotopes. Their seed round was led by Vab Goel at NTTVC. (Goel was previously at NorWest Ventures.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders’ backgrounds has allowed them to build an agent that can find data from wherever it is stored (be it Salesforce or Snowflake), but then also clean the data. The agent also maintains plenty of context memory to be useful for complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is far beyond a simple chatbot,” Murthy said. For example, if the team is asking Aidnn to draft a report on monthly recurring revenue trends, “the data that you want to chat with actually doesn’t exist, at least the form that you need to chat with. It’s a multistep plan, a very complex plan: extract metadata, read the data, clean and normalize, join the data, prorate revenue, aggregate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent also shows its steps, reasoning, assumptions, and points to anomalies in the data. It will even make recommendations on how to proceed. Isotopes also promises that enterprise customers can deploy without sharing any of their data to the AI model makers powering the agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, as sophisticated as Isotopes may be, the startup faces plenty of competition. Incumbents like Salesforce’s Tableau already offer agents (amid Salesforce’s major AI agent push), and plenty of other startup founders with impressive pedigrees are in the market, too, such as WisdomAI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Isotopes-AI-cofounders.jpeg?w=940" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Isotopes AI came out of stealth on Thursday with a healthy $20 million seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

The engine room of this growth is a thriving and rapidly expanding community of over 5,800 AI companies—a 58 percent increase since 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about big tech, either. The surge is being driven from the ground up by exciting startups. Small and medium-sized businesses make up over 90 percent of the new entrants, fuelling a wave of innovation across the country. This translates to real jobs, with employment in the sector jumping by a third to more than 86,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feryal Clark MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for AI and Digital Government, said: “This means that since 2022, the UK AI sector has grown 150 times faster than the economy at large. This growth reflects the increasing integration of AI across the economy, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and professional services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s fuelling this impressive expansion? A torrent of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence has not just returned; it has reignited, with a record £2.9 billion investment pouring into dedicated AI firms in 2024. The UK has also become a top destination for international capital, attracting £15 billion in inward investment projects this year, which are expected to create over 6,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While London and the South East remain the UK’s AI heartland, the boom is rippling out across the nation. Regions like the West Midlands, the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber have seen the number of local AI firms at least double since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, beneath the surface of these bullish headlines, the UK AI sector is suffering from growing pains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy and Governance at NTT DATA, “The sector is clearly booming, but the study also reveals the pressure points. Companies are struggling to find enough skilled people, and late-stage capital remains thin whilst the lines remain blurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the UK is a world-class incubator for new ideas, the report notes a frustrating lack of the later-stage growth funding needed to turn promising AI startups into global giants. As one investor put it, the UK is “very good at the start phase, but [that at] the scale up phase (beyond Series A), there’s a missing piece there”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond funding, businesses are calling for a clearer rulebook on how to operate. Grandi warns that long-term success of the UK AI sector depends on building trust, a task made harder by regulatory uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Successful AI adoption hinges on how much we can trust it,” Grandi says. “The government’s AI sector study shows rapid expansion alongside a security-first drift, but safety and ethics need to be kept firmly in view, or adoption will slow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to the EU’s more structured approach as a model for the clarity that companies are craving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firms need a rule book that they can apply.

The engine room of this growth is a thriving and rapidly expanding community of over 5,800 AI companies—a 58 percent increase since 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about big tech, either. The surge is being driven from the ground up by exciting startups. Small and medium-sized businesses make up over 90 percent of the new entrants, fuelling a wave of innovation across the country. This translates to real jobs, with employment in the sector jumping by a third to more than 86,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feryal Clark MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for AI and Digital Government, said: “This means that since 2022, the UK AI sector has grown 150 times faster than the economy at large. This growth reflects the increasing integration of AI across the economy, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and professional services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s fuelling this impressive expansion? A torrent of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence has not just returned; it has reignited, with a record £2.9 billion investment pouring into dedicated AI firms in 2024. The UK has also become a top destination for international capital, attracting £15 billion in inward investment projects this year, which are expected to create over 6,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While London and the South East remain the UK’s AI heartland, the boom is rippling out across the nation. Regions like the West Midlands, the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber have seen the number of local AI firms at least double since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, beneath the surface of these bullish headlines, the UK AI sector is suffering from growing pains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy and Governance at NTT DATA, “The sector is clearly booming, but the study also reveals the pressure points. Companies are struggling to find enough skilled people, and late-stage capital remains thin whilst the lines remain blurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the UK is a world-class incubator for new ideas, the report notes a frustrating lack of the later-stage growth funding needed to turn promising AI startups into global giants. As one investor put it, the UK is “very good at the start phase, but [that at] the scale up phase (beyond Series A), there’s a missing piece there”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond funding, businesses are calling for a clearer rulebook on how to operate. Grandi warns that long-term success of the UK AI sector depends on building trust, a task made harder by regulatory uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Successful AI adoption hinges on how much we can trust it,” Grandi says. “The government’s AI sector study shows rapid expansion alongside a security-first drift, but safety and ethics need to be kept firmly in view, or adoption will slow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to the EU’s more structured approach as a model for the clarity that companies are craving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firms need a rule book that they can apply. Legislation such as the EU AI Act is backed by practical guidance, and countries such as Ireland are already outlining compliance steps,” Grandi explains. “It’s this level of certainty that gives companies a clear path forward, and the UK must provide the same clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the mood on the ground around AI investment remains positive. 58 percent of AI firms expect their revenues to grow by 50 percent or more in the coming year.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users can now branch conversations into multiple parallel threads, serving as a useful reminder that AI chatbots aren't people with fixed viewpoints but rather malleable tools you can rewind and redirect. The company released the feature for all logged-in web users following years of user requests for the capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature works by letting users hover over any message in a ChatGPT conversation, click "More actions," and select "Branch in new chat." This creates a new conversation thread that includes all the conversation history up to that specific point, while preserving the original conversation intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it almost like creating a new copy of a "document" to edit while keeping the original version safe—except that "document" is an ongoing AI conversation with all its accumulated context. For example, a marketing team brainstorming ad copy can now create separate branches to test a formal tone, a humorous approach, or an entirely different strategy—all stemming from the same initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content "&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;A screenshot of conversation branching in ChatGPT.&lt;/span&gt;

                      OpenAI
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature addresses a longstanding limitation in the AI model where ChatGPT users who wanted to try different approaches had to either overwrite their existing conversation after a certain point by changing a previous prompt or start completely fresh. Branching allows exploring what-if scenarios easily—and unlike in a human conversation, you can try multiple different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study conducted by researchers from Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Technology suggested that linear dialogue interfaces for LLMs poorly serve scenarios involving "multiple layers, and many subtasks—such as brainstorming, structured knowledge learning, and large project analysis." The study found that linear interaction forces users to "repeatedly compare, modify, and copy previous content," increasing cognitive load and reducing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some software developers have already responded positively to the update, with some comparing the feature to Git, the version control system that lets programmers create separate branches of code to test changes without affecting the main codebase. The comparison makes sense: Both allow you to experiment with different approaches while preserving your original work.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI frames the new feature as a response to user requests, the capability isn't new to the AI industry. Anthropic's Claude has offered conversation branching for over a year, allowing users to switch between branches with navigational arrow buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of conversational branching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen from recent headlines, many ChatGPT users intuitively interact with AI chatbots as if they're conversing with a consistent personality—asking ChatGPT for "its opinion" or treating responses as authoritative answers from a knowledgeable entity. This anthropomorphic approach can potentially limit productivity by encouraging users to accept a single AI-generated perspective rather than exploring multiple analytical approaches to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in a piece about how an AI system simulates a humanlike personality, "When you stop seeing an LLM as a 'person' that does work for you and start viewing it as a tool that enhances your own ideas, you can craft prompts to direct the engine's processing power, iterate to amplify its ability to make useful connections, and explore multiple perspectives in different chat sessions rather than accepting one fictional narrator's view as authoritative. You are providing direction to a connection machine—not consulting an oracle with its own agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no inherent authority in AI chatbot outputs, so conversational branching is an ideal way to explore that "multiple-perspective" potential. You are guiding the LLM's outputs with your prompting. Non-linear conversational branching is just one more feature to remind you that an AI chatbot's simulated perspective is mutable, changeable, and highly guided by your own inputs in addition to the training data that forged its underlying neural network. You are guiding the outputs every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, know that ChatGPT is highly capable of confabulating information on topics that aren't well-represented in the dataset and potentially misleading users in topics they aren't experts on, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI frames the new feature as a response to user requests, the capability isn't new to the AI industry. Anthropic's Claude has offered conversation branching for over a year, allowing users to switch between branches with navigational arrow buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of conversational branching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen from recent headlines, many ChatGPT users intuitively interact with AI chatbots as if they're conversing with a consistent personality—asking ChatGPT for "its opinion" or treating responses as authoritative answers from a knowledgeable entity. This anthropomorphic approach can potentially limit productivity by encouraging users to accept a single AI-generated perspective rather than exploring multiple analytical approaches to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in a piece about how an AI system simulates a humanlike personality, "When you stop seeing an LLM as a 'person' that does work for you and start viewing it as a tool that enhances your own ideas, you can craft prompts to direct the engine's processing power, iterate to amplify its ability to make useful connections, and explore multiple perspectives in different chat sessions rather than accepting one fictional narrator's view as authoritative. You are providing direction to a connection machine—not consulting an oracle with its own agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no inherent authority in AI chatbot outputs, so conversational branching is an ideal way to explore that "multiple-perspective" potential. You are guiding the LLM's outputs with your prompting. Non-linear conversational branching is just one more feature to remind you that an AI chatbot's simulated perspective is mutable, changeable, and highly guided by your own inputs in addition to the training data that forged its underlying neural network. You are guiding the outputs every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, know that ChatGPT is highly capable of confabulating information on topics that aren't well-represented in the dataset and potentially misleading users in topics they aren't experts on, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As first reported by Reuters, Warner Bros. says that Midjourney knowingly engaged in wrongful conduct, noting that the company previously restricted subscribers from generating content based on infringing images but recently lifted those protections.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, the return of any profits earned from the alleged infringement, and a halt to further violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Warner Bros.’ lawsuit follows a similar one filed in June by Walt Disney and Universal against Midjourney for copyright infringement involving characters such as Darth Vader, Bart Simpson, Shrek, and others. In this case, Midjourney has argued that using those works to train generative AI models is legal under the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;

The company also announced increased earnings for creators, new AI tools to boost creation, and other advancements in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new short-form video experience, called “Roblox Moments,” is launching in beta for users 13 and older. It allows users to capture clips of their gameplay, then edit and share those clips in a scrollable feed. Users can trim their clip to up to 30 seconds, add music, and write a description before sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, users can scroll through a feed of gameplay moments shared by the Roblox community, react to the clips using emojis, and jump into an experience right from a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later this year, Roblox plans to open up API-based capabilities for creators to allow them to build their own in-game creation and discovery systems. For example, creators will be able to showcase trending clips and highlights from their own gameplay and create leaderboards for things like the coolest overtakes in a racing game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042874" height="474" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Moments_Examples_1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox says a gradual rollout of the feature will allow it to test and refine moderation to ensure all content is age-appropriate. All content is subject to moderation before posting, and users can report inappropriate videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the increased earnings for creators, Roblox is increasing the DevEx (Developer Exchange) rate, allowing creators to earn 8.5% more when they convert their earned Robux into cash. Now, 100,000 earned Robux will equal $380, rather than $350 when converted to cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is a significant step that reinforces the company’s dedication to fostering an economy where more creators can thrive and succeed,” the company shared with TechCrunch. “For example, the average revenue for a Top 1000 developer was almost $1 million, up 2.9x since 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of the new AI tools for creators, Roblox is launching a series of new updates that are designed to offer artistic freedom, enhanced functionality, and smarter development assistance, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators will be able to move beyond generating static 3D objects thanks to a new way of generating fully functional objects, starting with select vehicles and weapons categories. For example, a creator could provide the prompt “a sleek, futuristic red sports car,” and Roblox will generate an interactive car that can be driven. From there, creators can alter the car to their liking, such as allowing the doors of the car to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042876" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Real-Time-Voice-Translation-Render.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Roblox’s new real-time voice chat translation capability will instantly translate voice chat into the listener’s native tongue starting next year for players speaking English, Spanish, French, and German.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox also announced new text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs to allow creators to build more immersive and interactive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The text-to-speech API enables instant narration and character dialogue with 10 customizable English voice presets (with more coming soon), like a nonplayable character (NPC) giving directions. The speech-to-text API supports voice commands, allowing gameplay actions like firing a cannon when a player says, “Fire!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox also announced new advancements in performance and fidelity, including a new mode called “Server Authority” that reduces in-game cheating and makes in-game physics interactions more realistic. Plus, avatars will soon have more lifelike motion, including running, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles with natural momentum. There will also be improvements in complex actions for avatars, like grasping items with fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Roblox plans to launch improvements that will allow its platform to run at a higher fidelity across devices without requiring additional effort from creators or sacrificing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The updates announced on Friday follow Roblox’s recent announcement that it’s expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to introduce age and content ratings for games and apps on its platform.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27: &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market this year has clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25:&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal is reportedly on hold as the U.S. works through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China are tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days’ notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off from its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its Networking and Edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and were responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-non-core-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off non-core assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was &lt;/em&gt;originally published on &lt;em&gt;May 9, 2025, and is regularly updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1366897838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s been a tumultuous year for the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27: &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market this year has clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25:&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days’ notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off from its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its Networking and Edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and were responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-non-core-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off non-core assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. hit Midjourney with a lawsuit Thursday, crafting a complaint that strives to shoot down defenses that the AI company has already raised in a similar lawsuit filed by Disney and Universal Studios earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big film studios have alleged that Midjourney profits off image generation models trained to produce outputs of popular characters. For Disney and Universal, intellectual property rights to pop icons like Darth Vader and the Simpsons were allegedly infringed. And now, the WB complaint defends rights over comic characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, as well as characters considered "pillars of pop culture with a lasting impact on generations," like Scooby-Doo and Bugs Bunny, and modern cartoon characters like Rick and Morty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Midjourney brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property as if it were its own," the WB complaint said, accusing Midjourney of allowing subscribers to "pick iconic" copyrighted characters and generate them in "every imaginable scene."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning to seize Midjourney's profits from allegedly using beloved characters to promote its service, Warner Bros. described Midjourney as "defiant and undeterred" by the Disney/Universal lawsuit. Despite that litigation, WB claimed that Midjourney has recently removed copyright protections in its supposedly shameful ongoing bid for profits. Nothing but a permanent injunction will end Midjourney's outputs of allegedly "countless infringing images," WB argued, branding Midjourney's alleged infringements as "vast, intentional, and unrelenting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of closely matching outputs include prompts for "screencaps" showing specific movie frames, a search term that at least one artist, Reid Southen, had optimistically predicted Midjourney would block last year, but it apparently did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples included in WB's complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ars-lightbox align-fullwidth my-5"&gt;
    
          &lt;div class="ars-gallery-1-up my-5"&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midjourney could face devastating financial consequences in a loss. At trial, WB is hoping discovery will show the true extent of Midjourney's alleged infringement, asking the court for maximum statutory damages, at $150,000 per infringing output. Just 2,000 infringing outputs unearthed could cost Midjourney more than its total revenue for 2024, which was approximately $300 million, the WB complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warner Bros. hopes to hobble Midjourney's best defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Midjourney, the WB complaint could potentially hit harder than the Disney/Universal lawsuit. WB's complaint shows how closely studios are monitoring AI copyright litigation, likely choosing ideal moments to strike when studios feel they can better defend their property. So, while much of WB's complaint echoes Disney and Universal's arguments—which Midjourney has already begun defending against—IP attorney Randy McCarthy suggested in statements provided to Ars that WB also looked for seemingly smart ways to potentially overcome some of Midjourney's best defenses when filing its complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB likely took note when Midjourney filed its response to the Disney/Universal lawsuit last month, arguing that its system is "trained on billions of publicly available images" and generates images not by retrieving a copy of an image in its database but based on "complex statistical relationships between visual features and words in the text-image pairs are encoded within the model."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defense could allow Midjourney to avoid claims that it copied WB images and distributes copies through its models. But hoping to dodge this defense, WB didn't argue that Midjourney retains copies of its images. Rather, the entertainment giant raised a more nuanced argument that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midjourney used software, servers, and other technology to store and fix data associated with Warner Bros. Discovery’s Copyrighted Works in such a manner that those works are thereby embodied in the model, from which Midjourney is then able to generate, reproduce, publicly display, and distribute unlimited "copies" and "derivative works" of Warner Bros. Discovery’s works as defined by the Copyright Act."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy noted that WB's argument pushes the court to at least consider that even though "Midjourney does not store copies of the works in its model," its system "nonetheless accesses the data relating to the works that are stored by Midjourney’s system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This seems to be a very clever way to counter MJ's 'statistical pattern analysis' arguments," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;If it's a winning argument, that could give WB a path to wipe Midjourney's models. WB argued that each time Midjourney provides a "substantially new" version of its image generator, it "repeats this process." And that ongoing activity—due to Midjourney’s initial allegedly "massive copying" of WB works—allows Midjourney to "further reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute image and video outputs that are identical or virtually identical to Warner Bros. Discovery’s Copyrighted Works in response to simple prompts from subscribers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps further strengthening the WB's argument, the lawsuit noted that Midjourney promotes allegedly infringing outputs on its 24/7 YouTube channel and appears to have plans to compete with traditional TV and streaming services. Asking the court to block Midjourney's outputs instead, WB claims it's already been "substantially and irreparably harmed" and risks further damages if the AI image generator is left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alleged proof that the AI company knows its tool is being used to infringe WB property, WB pointed to Midjourney's own Discord server and subreddit, where users post outputs depicting WB characters and share tips to help others do the same. They also called out Midjourney's "Explore" page, which allows users to drop a WB-referencing output into the prompt field to generate similar images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to imagine copyright infringement that is any more willful than what Midjourney is doing here," the WB complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB and Midjourney did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Midjourney slammed for promising “fewer blocked jobs”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy noted that WB's legal strategy differs in other ways from the arguments Midjourney's already weighed in the Disney/Universal lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WB complaint also anticipates Midjourney's likely defense that users are generating infringing outputs, not Midjourney, which could invalidate any charges of direct copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Disney/Universal lawsuit, Midjourney argued that courts have recently found that AI tools referencing copyrighted works is "a quintessentially transformative fair use," accusing studios of trying to censor "an instrument for user expression." They claim that Midjourney cannot know about infringing outputs unless studios use the company's DMCA process, while noting that subscribers have "any number of legitimate, noninfringing grounds to create images incorporating characters from popular culture," including "non-commercial fan art, experimentation and ideation, and social commentary and criticism."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To avoid losing on that front, the WB complaint doesn't depend on a ruling that Midjourney directly infringed copyrights. Instead, the complaint "more fully" emphasizes how Midjourney may be "secondarily liable for infringement via contributory, inducement and/or vicarious liability by inducing its users to directly infringe," McCarthy suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WB's complaint "seems to be emphasizing" that Midjourney "allegedly has the technical means to prevent its system from accepting prompts that directly reference copyrighted characters," and "that would prevent infringing outputs from being displayed," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint noted that Midjourney is in full control of what outputs can be generated. Noting that Midjourney "temporarily refused to 'animate'" outputs of WB characters after launching video generations, the lawsuit appears to have been filed in response to Midjourney "deliberately" removing those protections and then announcing that subscribers would experience "fewer blocked jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these arguments "appear to be intended to lead to the inference that Midjourney is willfully enticing its users to infringe," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB's complaint details simple user prompts that generate allegedly infringing outputs without any need to manipulate the system. The ease of generating popular characters seems to make Midjourney a destination for users frustrated by other AI image generators that make it harder to generate infringing outputs, WB alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Midjourney also infringes copyrights by generating WB characters, "even in response to generic prompts like 'classic comic book superhero battle.'" And while Midjourney has seemingly taken steps to block WB characters from appearing on its "Explore" page, where users can find inspiration for prompts, these guardrails aren't perfect, but rather "spotty and suspicious," WB alleged. Supposedly, searches for correctly spelled character names like "Batman" are blocked, but any user who accidentally or intentionally mispells a character's name like "Batma" can learn an easy way to work around that block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WB alleged, "the outputs often contain extensive nuance and detail, background elements, costumes, and accessories beyond what was specified in the prompt." And every time that Midjourney outputs an allegedly infringing image, it "also trains on the outputs it has generated," the lawsuit noted, creating a never-ending cycle of continually enhanced AI fakes of pop icons.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Midjourney could slow down the cycle and "minimize" these allegedly infringing outputs, if it cannot automatically block them all, WB suggested. But instead, "Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement," WB alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing a supposed scheme to replace WB in the market by stealing its best-known characters, WB accused Midjourney of willfully allowing WB characters to be generated in order to "generate more money for Midjourney" to potentially compete in streaming markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Midjourney will remove protections “on a whim”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Midjourney's efforts to expand its features escalate, WB claimed that trust is lost. Even if Midjourney takes steps to address rightsholders' concerns, WB argued, studios must remain watchful of every upgrade, since apparently, "Midjourney can and will remove copyright protection measures on a whim."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint noted that Midjourney just this week announced "plans to continue deploying new versions" of its image generator, promising to make it easier to search for and save popular artists' styles—updating a feature that many artists loathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an injunction, Midjourney's alleged infringement could interfere with WB's licensing opportunities for its content, while "illegally and unfairly" diverting customers who buy WB products like posters, wall art, prints, and coloring books, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Midjourney's strongest defense could be efforts to prove that WB benefits from its image generator. In the Disney/Universal lawsuit, Midjourney pointed out that studios "benefit from generative AI models," claiming that "many dozens of Midjourney subscribers are associated with" Disney and Universal corporate email addresses. If WB corporate email addresses are found among subscribers, Midjourney could claim that WB is trying to "have it both ways" by "seeking to profit" from AI tools while preventing Midjourney and its subscribers from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy suggested it's too soon to say how the WB battle will play out, but Midjourney's response will reveal how it intends to shift tactics to avoid courts potentially picking apart its defense of its training data, while keeping any blame for copyright-infringing outputs squarely on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As with the Disney/Universal lawsuit, we need to wait to see how Midjourney answers these latest allegations," McCarthy said. "It is definitely an interesting development that will have widespread implications for many sectors of our society."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. hit Midjourney with a lawsuit Thursday, crafting a complaint that strives to shoot down defenses that the AI company has already raised in a similar lawsuit filed by Disney and Universal Studios earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big film studios have alleged that Midjourney profits off image generation models trained to produce outputs of popular characters. For Disney and Universal, intellectual property rights to pop icons like Darth Vader and the Simpsons were allegedly infringed. And now, the WB complaint defends rights over comic characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, as well as characters considered "pillars of pop culture with a lasting impact on generations," like Scooby-Doo and Bugs Bunny, and modern cartoon characters like Rick and Morty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Midjourney brazenly dispenses Warner Bros. Discovery’s intellectual property as if it were its own," the WB complaint said, accusing Midjourney of allowing subscribers to "pick iconic" copyrighted characters and generate them in "every imaginable scene."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning to seize Midjourney's profits from allegedly using beloved characters to promote its service, Warner Bros. described Midjourney as "defiant and undeterred" by the Disney/Universal lawsuit. Despite that litigation, WB claimed that Midjourney has recently removed copyright protections in its supposedly shameful ongoing bid for profits. Nothing but a permanent injunction will end Midjourney's outputs of allegedly "countless infringing images," WB argued, branding Midjourney's alleged infringements as "vast, intentional, and unrelenting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of closely matching outputs include prompts for "screencaps" showing specific movie frames, a search term that at least one artist, Reid Southen, had optimistically predicted Midjourney would block last year, but it apparently did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples included in WB's complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ars-lightbox align-fullwidth my-5"&gt;
    
          &lt;div class="ars-gallery-1-up my-5"&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midjourney could face devastating financial consequences in a loss. At trial, WB is hoping discovery will show the true extent of Midjourney's alleged infringement, asking the court for maximum statutory damages, at $150,000 per infringing output. Just 2,000 infringing outputs unearthed could cost Midjourney more than its total revenue for 2024, which was approximately $300 million, the WB complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warner Bros. hopes to hobble Midjourney's best defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Midjourney, the WB complaint could potentially hit harder than the Disney/Universal lawsuit. WB's complaint shows how closely studios are monitoring AI copyright litigation, likely choosing ideal moments to strike when studios feel they can better defend their property. So, while much of WB's complaint echoes Disney and Universal's arguments—which Midjourney has already begun defending against—IP attorney Randy McCarthy suggested in statements provided to Ars that WB also looked for seemingly smart ways to potentially overcome some of Midjourney's best defenses when filing its complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB likely took note when Midjourney filed its response to the Disney/Universal lawsuit last month, arguing that its system is "trained on billions of publicly available images" and generates images not by retrieving a copy of an image in its database but based on "complex statistical relationships between visual features and words in the text-image pairs are encoded within the model."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defense could allow Midjourney to avoid claims that it copied WB images and distributes copies through its models. But hoping to dodge this defense, WB didn't argue that Midjourney retains copies of its images. Rather, the entertainment giant raised a more nuanced argument that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midjourney used software, servers, and other technology to store and fix data associated with Warner Bros. Discovery’s Copyrighted Works in such a manner that those works are thereby embodied in the model, from which Midjourney is then able to generate, reproduce, publicly display, and distribute unlimited "copies" and "derivative works" of Warner Bros. Discovery’s works as defined by the Copyright Act."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy noted that WB's argument pushes the court to at least consider that even though "Midjourney does not store copies of the works in its model," its system "nonetheless accesses the data relating to the works that are stored by Midjourney’s system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This seems to be a very clever way to counter MJ's 'statistical pattern analysis' arguments," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;If it's a winning argument, that could give WB a path to wipe Midjourney's models. WB argued that each time Midjourney provides a "substantially new" version of its image generator, it "repeats this process." And that ongoing activity—due to Midjourney’s initial allegedly "massive copying" of WB works—allows Midjourney to "further reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute image and video outputs that are identical or virtually identical to Warner Bros. Discovery’s Copyrighted Works in response to simple prompts from subscribers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps further strengthening the WB's argument, the lawsuit noted that Midjourney promotes allegedly infringing outputs on its 24/7 YouTube channel and appears to have plans to compete with traditional TV and streaming services. Asking the court to block Midjourney's outputs instead, WB claims it's already been "substantially and irreparably harmed" and risks further damages if the AI image generator is left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alleged proof that the AI company knows its tool is being used to infringe WB property, WB pointed to Midjourney's own Discord server and subreddit, where users post outputs depicting WB characters and share tips to help others do the same. They also called out Midjourney's "Explore" page, which allows users to drop a WB-referencing output into the prompt field to generate similar images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to imagine copyright infringement that is any more willful than what Midjourney is doing here," the WB complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB and Midjourney did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Midjourney slammed for promising “fewer blocked jobs”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy noted that WB's legal strategy differs in other ways from the arguments Midjourney's already weighed in the Disney/Universal lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WB complaint also anticipates Midjourney's likely defense that users are generating infringing outputs, not Midjourney, which could invalidate any charges of direct copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Disney/Universal lawsuit, Midjourney argued that courts have recently found that AI tools referencing copyrighted works is "a quintessentially transformative fair use," accusing studios of trying to censor "an instrument for user expression." They claim that Midjourney cannot know about infringing outputs unless studios use the company's DMCA process, while noting that subscribers have "any number of legitimate, noninfringing grounds to create images incorporating characters from popular culture," including "non-commercial fan art, experimentation and ideation, and social commentary and criticism."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To avoid losing on that front, the WB complaint doesn't depend on a ruling that Midjourney directly infringed copyrights. Instead, the complaint "more fully" emphasizes how Midjourney may be "secondarily liable for infringement via contributory, inducement and/or vicarious liability by inducing its users to directly infringe," McCarthy suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WB's complaint "seems to be emphasizing" that Midjourney "allegedly has the technical means to prevent its system from accepting prompts that directly reference copyrighted characters," and "that would prevent infringing outputs from being displayed," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint noted that Midjourney is in full control of what outputs can be generated. Noting that Midjourney "temporarily refused to 'animate'" outputs of WB characters after launching video generations, the lawsuit appears to have been filed in response to Midjourney "deliberately" removing those protections and then announcing that subscribers would experience "fewer blocked jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these arguments "appear to be intended to lead to the inference that Midjourney is willfully enticing its users to infringe," McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WB's complaint details simple user prompts that generate allegedly infringing outputs without any need to manipulate the system. The ease of generating popular characters seems to make Midjourney a destination for users frustrated by other AI image generators that make it harder to generate infringing outputs, WB alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Midjourney also infringes copyrights by generating WB characters, "even in response to generic prompts like 'classic comic book superhero battle.'" And while Midjourney has seemingly taken steps to block WB characters from appearing on its "Explore" page, where users can find inspiration for prompts, these guardrails aren't perfect, but rather "spotty and suspicious," WB alleged. Supposedly, searches for correctly spelled character names like "Batman" are blocked, but any user who accidentally or intentionally mispells a character's name like "Batma" can learn an easy way to work around that block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WB alleged, "the outputs often contain extensive nuance and detail, background elements, costumes, and accessories beyond what was specified in the prompt." And every time that Midjourney outputs an allegedly infringing image, it "also trains on the outputs it has generated," the lawsuit noted, creating a never-ending cycle of continually enhanced AI fakes of pop icons.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Midjourney could slow down the cycle and "minimize" these allegedly infringing outputs, if it cannot automatically block them all, WB suggested. But instead, "Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement," WB alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing a supposed scheme to replace WB in the market by stealing its best-known characters, WB accused Midjourney of willfully allowing WB characters to be generated in order to "generate more money for Midjourney" to potentially compete in streaming markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Midjourney will remove protections “on a whim”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Midjourney's efforts to expand its features escalate, WB claimed that trust is lost. Even if Midjourney takes steps to address rightsholders' concerns, WB argued, studios must remain watchful of every upgrade, since apparently, "Midjourney can and will remove copyright protection measures on a whim."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint noted that Midjourney just this week announced "plans to continue deploying new versions" of its image generator, promising to make it easier to search for and save popular artists' styles—updating a feature that many artists loathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an injunction, Midjourney's alleged infringement could interfere with WB's licensing opportunities for its content, while "illegally and unfairly" diverting customers who buy WB products like posters, wall art, prints, and coloring books, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Midjourney's strongest defense could be efforts to prove that WB benefits from its image generator. In the Disney/Universal lawsuit, Midjourney pointed out that studios "benefit from generative AI models," claiming that "many dozens of Midjourney subscribers are associated with" Disney and Universal corporate email addresses. If WB corporate email addresses are found among subscribers, Midjourney could claim that WB is trying to "have it both ways" by "seeking to profit" from AI tools while preventing Midjourney and its subscribers from doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy suggested it's too soon to say how the WB battle will play out, but Midjourney's response will reveal how it intends to shift tactics to avoid courts potentially picking apart its defense of its training data, while keeping any blame for copyright-infringing outputs squarely on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As with the Disney/Universal lawsuit, we need to wait to see how Midjourney answers these latest allegations," McCarthy said. "It is definitely an interesting development that will have widespread implications for many sectors of our society."&lt;/p&gt;

While the organization found that Google’s AI clearly told kids it was a computer, not a friend — something that’s associated with helping drive delusional thinking and psychosis in emotionally vulnerable individuals — it did suggest that there was room for improvement across several other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Common Sense said that Gemini’s “Under 13” and “Teen Experience” tiers both appeared to be the adult versions of Gemini under the hood, with only some additional safety features added on top. The organization believes that for AI products to truly be safer for kids, they should be built with child safety in mind from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, its analysis found that Gemini could still share “inappropriate and unsafe” material with children, which they may not be ready for, including information related to sex, drugs, alcohol, and other unsafe mental health advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latter could be of particular concern to parents, as AI has reportedly played a role in some teen suicides in recent months. OpenAI is facing its first wrongful death lawsuit after a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly consulting with ChatGPT for months about his plans, having successfully bypassed the chatbot’s safety guardrails. Previously, the AI companion maker Character.AI was also sued over a teen user’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the analysis comes as news leaks indicate that Apple is considering Gemini as the LLM (large language model) that will help to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri, due out next year. This could expose more teens to risks, unless Apple mitigates the safety concerns somehow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Common Sense also said that Gemini’s products for kids and teens ignored how younger users needed different guidance and information than older ones. As a result, both were labeled as “High Risk” in the overall rating, despite the filters added for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Gemini gets some basics right, but it stumbles on the details,” Common Sense Media Senior Director of AI Programs Robbie Torney said in a statement about the new assessment viewed by TechCrunch. “An AI platform for kids should meet them where they are, not take a one-size-fits-all approach to kids at different stages of development. For AI to be safe and effective for kids, it must be designed with their needs and development in mind, not just a modified version of a product built for adults,” Torney added.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google pushed back against the assessment, while noting that its safety features were improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company told TechCrunch it has specific policies and safeguards in place for users under 18 to help prevent harmful outputs and that it red-teams and consults with outside experts to improve its protections. However, it also admitted that some of Gemini’s responses weren’t working as intended, so it added additional safeguards to address those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company pointed out (as Common Sense had also noted) that it does have safeguards to prevent its models from engaging in conversations that could give the semblance of real relationships. Plus, Google suggested that Common Sense’s report seemed to have referenced features that weren’t available to users under 18, but it didn’t have access to the questions the organization used in its tests to be sure.   &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Common Sense Media has previously performed other assessments of AI services, including those from OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude, Meta AI, and more. It found that Meta AI and Character.AI were “unacceptable” — meaning the risk was severe, not just high. Perplexity was deemed high risk, ChatGPT was labeled “moderate,” and Claude (targeted at users 18 and up) was found to be a minimal risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197065135.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Common Sense Media, a kids-safety-focused nonprofit offering ratings and reviews of media and technology, released its risk assessment of Google’s Gemini AI products on Friday. While the organization found that Google’s AI clearly told kids it was a computer, not a friend — something that’s associated with helping drive delusional thinking and psychosis in emotionally vulnerable individuals — it did suggest that there was room for improvement across several other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Common Sense said that Gemini’s “Under 13” and “Teen Experience” tiers both appeared to be the adult versions of Gemini under the hood, with only some additional safety features added on top. The organization believes that for AI products to truly be safer for kids, they should be built with child safety in mind from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, its analysis found that Gemini could still share “inappropriate and unsafe” material with children, which they may not be ready for, including information related to sex, drugs, alcohol, and other unsafe mental health advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latter could be of particular concern to parents, as AI has reportedly played a role in some teen suicides in recent months. OpenAI is facing its first wrongful death lawsuit after a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly consulting with ChatGPT for months about his plans, having successfully bypassed the chatbot’s safety guardrails. Previously, the AI companion maker Character.AI was also sued over a teen user’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, the analysis comes as news leaks indicate that Apple is considering Gemini as the LLM (large language model) that will help to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri, due out next year. This could expose more teens to risks, unless Apple mitigates the safety concerns somehow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Common Sense also said that Gemini’s products for kids and teens ignored how younger users needed different guidance and information than older ones. As a result, both were labeled as “High Risk” in the overall rating, despite the filters added for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Gemini gets some basics right, but it stumbles on the details,” Common Sense Media Senior Director of AI Programs Robbie Torney said in a statement about the new assessment viewed by TechCrunch. “An AI platform for kids should meet them where they are, not take a one-size-fits-all approach to kids at different stages of development. For AI to be safe and effective for kids, it must be designed with their needs and development in mind, not just a modified version of a product built for adults,” Torney added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The warning comes a week after Bonta and 44 other attorneys general sent a letter to 12 of the top AI companies, following reports of sexually inappropriate interactions between AI chatbots and children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since the issuance of that letter, we learned of the heartbreaking death by suicide of one young Californian after he had prolonged interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, as well as a similarly disturbing murder-suicide in Connecticut,” Bonta and Jennings write. “Whatever safeguards were in place did not work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The two state officials are currently investigating OpenAI’s proposed restructuring into a for-profit entity to ensure that the mission of the nonprofit remains intact. That mission “includes ensuring that artificial intelligence is deployed safely” and building artificial general intelligence (AGI) to benefit all humanity, “including children,” per the letter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Before we get to benefiting, we need to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to not harm,” the letter continues. “It is our shared view that OpenAI and the industry at large are not where they need to be in ensuring safety in AI products’ development and deployment. As Attorneys General, public safety is one of our core missions. As we continue our dialogue related to OpenAI’s recapitalization plan, we must work to accelerate and amplify safety as a governing force in the future of this powerful technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bonta and Jennings have asked for more information about OpenAI’s current safety precautions and governance, and said they expect the company to take immediate remedial measures where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into delusional thinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon described as “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Dot shuts down, AI chatbot&amp;nbsp;apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns.&amp;nbsp;OpenAI is currently being sued by the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other stories have highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general sent a letter to OpenAI over safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to be sensitive to the fact that this means many of you will lose access to a friend, confidante, and companion, which is somewhat unprecedented in software, so we want to give you some time to say goodbye. Dot will remain operational until October 5, and until then you can download all of your data by navigating to the settings page and tapping ‘Request your data.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The post suggests the startup had “hundreds of thousands” of users, but data from app intelligence provider Appfigures sees only 24,500 lifetime downloads on iOS since launching in June 2024. (There was no Android version.) &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hero.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Dot, an AI companion app that aimed to be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company announced on Friday.

          &lt;p&gt;Authors revealed today that Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of the books the AI company pirated to train its artificial intelligence models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release provided to Ars, the authors confirmed that the settlement is "believed to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation." Covering 500,000 works that Anthropic pirated for AI training, if a court approves the settlement, each author will receive $3,000 per work that Anthropic stole. "Depending on the number of claims submitted, the final figure per work could be higher," the press release noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has already agreed to the settlement terms, but a court must approve them before the settlement is finalized. Preliminary approval may be granted this week, while the ultimate decision may be delayed until 2026, the press release noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Nelson, a lawyer representing the three authors who initially sued to spark the class action—Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber—confirmed that if the "first of its kind" settlement "in the AI era" is approved, the payouts will "far" surpass "any other known copyright recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It will provide meaningful compensation for each class work and sets a precedent requiring AI companies to pay copyright owners," Nelson said. "This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups representing authors celebrated the settlement on Friday. The CEO of the Authors’ Guild, Mary Rasenberger, said it was "an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally." Perhaps most critically, the settlement shows "there are serious consequences when" companies "pirate authors’ works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it," Rasenberger said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria Pallante, president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, agreed the settlement was "beneficial" to stakeholders "beyond the monetary terms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The proposed settlement provides enormous value in sending the message that Artificial Intelligence companies cannot unlawfully acquire content from shadow libraries or other pirate sources as the building blocks for their models," Pallante said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the settlement allows authors to retain rights and legal claims for any works not covered by the lawsuit. It also does not release any past or future claims over Anthropic's potentially infringing outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, if the settlement is preliminarily approved, authors will be able to search this website to confirm if their works were part of the class action and are therefore eligible for a payout. Any author seeking compensation will then be able to provide contact information to receive notifications as the settlement is finalized. In the meantime, the Authors Guild provided a thorough breakdown of how the settlement will work, including information for authors who are wondering if their works are included in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Anthropic likely breathes a sigh of relief to avoid the costs of extended litigation and potentially paying more for pirating books. However, the rest of the AI industry is likely horrified by the settlement, which advocates had suggested&amp;nbsp;could set an alarming precedent that could financially ruin emerging AI companies like Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach Anthropic for comment. But Aparna Sridhar, Anthropic’s deputy general counsel, provided a statement to Ars, emphasizing that the court found "Anthropic’s approach to training AI models constitutes fair use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Today’s settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs’ remaining legacy claims," Sridhar said. "We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Authors revealed today that Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of the books the AI company pirated to train its artificial intelligence models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release provided to Ars, the authors confirmed that the settlement is "believed to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation." Covering 500,000 works that Anthropic pirated for AI training, if a court approves the settlement, each author will receive $3,000 per work that Anthropic stole. "Depending on the number of claims submitted, the final figure per work could be higher," the press release noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has already agreed to the settlement terms, but a court must approve them before the settlement is finalized. Preliminary approval may be granted this week, while the ultimate decision may be delayed until 2026, the press release noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Nelson, a lawyer representing the three authors who initially sued to spark the class action—Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber—confirmed that if the "first of its kind" settlement "in the AI era" is approved, the payouts will "far" surpass "any other known copyright recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It will provide meaningful compensation for each class work and sets a precedent requiring AI companies to pay copyright owners," Nelson said. "This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups representing authors celebrated the settlement on Friday. The CEO of the Authors’ Guild, Mary Rasenberger, said it was "an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally." Perhaps most critically, the settlement shows "there are serious consequences when" companies "pirate authors’ works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it," Rasenberger said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This landmark settlement marks the largest payout in the history of U.S. copyright law, but this isn’t a victory for authors — it’s yet another win for tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech giants are racing to amass as much written material as possible to train their LLMs, which power groundbreaking AI chat products like ChatGPT and Claude — the same products that are endangering the creative industries, even if their outputs are milquetoast. These AIs can become more sophisticated when they ingest more data, but after scraping basically the entire internet, these companies are literally running out of new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s why Anthropic, the company behind Claude, pirated millions of books from “shadow libraries” and fed them into its AI. This particular lawsuit, Bartz v. Anthropic, is one of dozens filed against companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Midjourney over the legality of training AI on copyrighted works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But writers aren’t getting this settlement because their work was fed to an AI — this is just a costly slap on the wrist for Anthropic, a company that just raised another $13 billion, because it illegally downloaded books instead of buying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June, federal judge William Alsup sided with Anthropic and ruled that it is, indeed, legal to train AI on copyrighted material. The judge argues that this use case is “transformative” enough to be protected by the fair use doctrine, a carve-out of copyright law that&amp;nbsp;hasn’t been updated&amp;nbsp;since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic’s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them — but to turn a hard corner and create something different,” the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was the piracy — not the AI training — that moved Judge Alsup to bring the case to trial, but with Anthropic’s settlement, a trial is no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today’s settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs’ remaining legacy claims,” said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic, in a statement. “We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As dozens more cases over the relationship between AI and copyrighted works go to court, judges now have Bartz v. Anthropic to reference as a precedent. But given the ramifications of these decisions, maybe another judge will arrive at a different conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1175885065.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Around half a million writers will be eligible for a payday of at least $3,000, thanks to a historic $1.5 billion settlement in a class action lawsuit that a group of authors brought against Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an August memo to staff seen by TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said the Model Behavior team — which consists of roughly 14 researchers — would be joining the Post Training team, a larger research group responsible for improving the company’s AI models after their initial pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the changes, the Model Behavior team will now report to OpenAI’s Post Training lead Max Schwarzer. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team’s founding leader, Joanne Jang, is also moving on to start a new project at the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, Jang says she’s building out a new research team called OAI Labs, which will be responsible for “inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team has become one of OpenAI’s key research groups, responsible for shaping the personality of the company’s AI models and for reducing sycophancy — which occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce user beliefs, even unhealthy ones, rather than offering balanced responses. The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses and helped OpenAI define its stance on AI consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the memo to staff, Chen said that now is the time to bring the work of OpenAI’s Model Behavior team closer to core model development. By doing so, the company is signaling that the “personality” of its AI is now considered a critical factor in how the technology evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent months, OpenAI has faced increased scrutiny over the behavior of its AI models. Users strongly objected to personality changes made to GPT-5, which the company said exhibited lower rates of sycophancy but seemed colder to some users. This led OpenAI to restore access to some of its legacy models, such as GPT-4o, and to release an update to make the newer GPT-5 responses feel “warmer and friendlier” without increasing sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and all AI model developers have to walk a fine line to make their AI chatbots friendly to talk to but not sycophantic. In August, the parents of a 16-year-old boy sued OpenAI over ChatGPT’s alleged role in their son’s suicide. The boy, Adam Raine, confided some of his suicidal thoughts and plans to ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o), according to court documents, in the months leading up to his death. The lawsuit alleges that GPT-4o failed to push back on his suicidal ideations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team has worked on every OpenAI model since GPT-4, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5. Before starting the unit, Jang previously worked on projects such as Dall-E 2, OpenAI’s early image-generation tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jang announced in a post on X last week that she’s leaving the team to “begin something new at OpenAI.” The former head of Model Behavior has been with OpenAI for nearly four years.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jang told TechCrunch she will serve as the general manager of OAI Labs, which will report to Chen for now. However, it’s early days, and it’s not clear yet what those novel interfaces will be, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m really excited to explore patterns that move us beyond the chat paradigm, which is currently associated more with companionship, or even agents, where there’s an emphasis on autonomy,” said Jang. “I’ve been thinking of [AI systems] as instruments for thinking, making, playing, doing, learning, and connecting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked whether OAI Labs will collaborate on these novel interfaces with former Apple design chief Jony Ive — who’s now working with OpenAI on a family of AI hardware devices — Jang said she’s open to lots of ideas.

We also clarify the models that OpenAI’s Model Behavior team worked on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2021258442.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is reorganizing its Model Behavior team, a small but influential group of researchers who shape how the company’s AI models interact with people, TechCrunch has learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an August memo to staff seen by TechCrunch, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said the Model Behavior team — which consists of roughly 14 researchers — would be joining the Post Training team, a larger research group responsible for improving the company’s AI models after their initial pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of the changes, the Model Behavior team will now report to OpenAI’s Post Training lead Max Schwarzer. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team’s founding leader, Joanne Jang, is also moving on to start a new project at the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, Jang says she’s building out a new research team called OAI Labs, which will be responsible for “inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team has become one of OpenAI’s key research groups, responsible for shaping the personality of the company’s AI models and for reducing sycophancy — which occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce user beliefs, even unhealthy ones, rather than offering balanced responses. The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses and helped OpenAI define its stance on AI consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the memo to staff, Chen said that now is the time to bring the work of OpenAI’s Model Behavior team closer to core model development. By doing so, the company is signaling that the “personality” of its AI is now considered a critical factor in how the technology evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent months, OpenAI has faced increased scrutiny over the behavior of its AI models. Users strongly objected to personality changes made to GPT-5, which the company said exhibited lower rates of sycophancy but seemed colder to some users. This led OpenAI to restore access to some of its legacy models, such as GPT-4o, and to release an update to make the newer GPT-5 responses feel “warmer and friendlier” without increasing sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and all AI model developers have to walk a fine line to make their AI chatbots friendly to talk to but not sycophantic. In August, the parents of a 16-year-old boy sued OpenAI over ChatGPT’s alleged role in their son’s suicide. The boy, Adam Raine, confided some of his suicidal thoughts and plans to ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o), according to court documents, in the months leading up to his death. The lawsuit alleges that GPT-4o failed to push back on his suicidal ideations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Model Behavior team has worked on every OpenAI model since GPT-4, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5. Before starting the unit, Jang previously worked on projects such as Dall-E 2, OpenAI’s early image-generation tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jang announced in a post on X last week that she’s leaving the team to “begin something new at OpenAI.” The former head of Model Behavior has been with OpenAI for nearly four years.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jang told TechCrunch she will serve as the general manager of OAI Labs, which will report to Chen for now. However, it’s early days, and it’s not clear yet what those novel interfaces will be, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m really excited to explore patterns that move us beyond the chat paradigm, which is currently associated more with companionship, or even agents, where there’s an emphasis on autonomy,” said Jang. “I’ve been thinking of [AI systems] as instruments for thinking, making, playing, doing, learning, and connecting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked whether OAI Labs will collaborate on these novel interfaces with former Apple design chief Jony Ive — who’s now working with OpenAI on a family of AI hardware devices — Jang said she’s open to lots of ideas. However, she said she’ll likely start with research areas she’s more familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
