This highlights an urgent need for more sustainable urban planning and public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart traffic management market alone is projected to reach $20 billion by 2027 as cities deploy AI to accommodate growing population density and tourism-driven congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved traffic management is just one way AI is enhancing public spaces, transit and city processes — with many physical AI technologies being showcased at the Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC) taking place this week in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the event, NVIDIA’s expanding ecosystem of physical AI partners will be on full display —&amp;nbsp; including simulation and mapping companies, software vendors, manufacturers, systems integrators, and cloud and edge providers — all exhibiting their latest smart spaces applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI — announced in June at NVIDIA GTC Paris — combines digital twins with NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, synthetic data generation, AI model training with vision language models (VLMs) and video analytics AI agents using the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These work together in a single, streamlined workflow, enabling rapid simulation of real-world urban conditions, vast sensor integration and real-time vision AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to the blueprint include new NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models and VLMs to generate photorealistic synthetic data and provide physical reasoning capabilities, as well as the latest version of the VSS blueprint&amp;nbsp; — part of the NVIDIA Metropolis platform for training and building vision AI agents and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Access step-by-step intelligent traffic system workflows and technical recipes in new cookbooks for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA Cosmos Predict&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA Cosmos Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about how five leading companies are using these NVIDIA technologies to bring secure, scalable physical AI to more cities, including Dublin, Ireland; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; and Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five NVIDIA Physical AI Partners Showcasing New Technologies at SCEWC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban populations are soaring, infrastructure is aging, and challenges like traffic congestion, climate resilience and real-time safety demand new levels of responsiveness and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But integrating these video- and data-intensive systems isn’t just a matter of upgrading old infrastructure. Smart city deployments require a seamless fusion of next-generation AI, cloud and edge computing, ultrafast networking and open data platforms. A global ecosystem of partners, such as the ones highlighted below, must come together to solve these technological and real-world challenges for city-scale AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Esri&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping and spatial analytics company Esri is working with NVIDIA to build an AI agent that ingests, analyzes and visualizes massive amounts of camera data to generate real-time alerts and insights in an interactive geospatial map for the City of Raleigh in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An interactive geospatial map of Raleigh with a video analytics AI agent processing live sensor data. Images courtesy of Esri and the City of Raleigh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will enable city operators to quickly respond and notify key departments to efficiently resolve issues, optimize traffic flows and improve infrastructure design, boosting overall urban mobility. Tapping into components of the NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI will enable the city to discover, aggregate and manipulate data to help address key resident concerns, automate streetlight timing to reduce road delays and decrease carbon emissions from cars sitting in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Milestone Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milestone Systems is now introducing generative AI to its XProtect video management platform — allowing users to easily extract valuable analyses and insights from their video streams and libraries, review alerts and automatically generate reports. This functionality is powered by NVIDIA Cosmos Reason VLMs that Milestone post-trained with 75,000 hours of compliant traffic video, for each VLM, from either Europe or the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milestone is also offering these specialized VLMs-as-a-service to developers to build innovative applications. General availability is expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XProtect customers can easily add these new, GDPR-compliant features and add an additional layer of intelligence by contextualizing video, scheduling insights and providing on-demand reporting and automatic review of alerts. These features could reduce up to 30% of operator alarm fatigue by automating video review and filtering out false alarms. Cities like Dubuque, Iowa, and Genoa, Italy, are planning to try these new capabilities, adopting advanced video intelligence solutions to enhance traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linker Vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linker Vision, a pioneer in deploying the end-to-end NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI, is bringing physical AI to Ho Chi Minh City and Danang in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on its success in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, where its vision AI platform cut incident response times by up to 80%, Linker Vision, tapping into AVES Reality’s simulation-ready 3D digital twins using NVIDIA Omniverse, is now harnessing the blueprint to develop city-scale AI solutions that can simulate and monitor traffic and construction activities, helping ensure projects stay on schedule while improving urban mobility and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bentley Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, in Collaboration With &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;VivaCity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland’s Smart Dublin organization addresses urban challenges with physical AI and is tapping into Cesium, a 3D geospatial platform from Bentley Systems, and NVIDIA Omniverse to enable real-time data visualization and analysis for micromobility — like walking, cycling and using scooters — across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI transportation technology company VivaCity is using the NVIDIA Jetson and Metropolis platforms on its AI-powered computer vision sensors, providing Dublin with highly accurate, multimodal data and insights on cyclists, motor vehicles and pedestrians. This data is used to understand traffic patterns and road user behavior, as well as to identify dangerous sites using VivaCity’s award-winning solution across the Irish capital’s roadways, improving road safety and traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Dublin is also working with partners to integrate AI agents into a digital twin to gain insights and alert city operators faster. As a first step, Smart Dublin integrated VivaCity data into a Cesium-powered digital twin to visualize and understand bike route utilization. Adding rainfall data, the city saw that poor weather had a negligible impact on the number of cyclists on the road. Future plans include adding AI features like natural language search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Smart Dublin project, Bentley’s AI technology Blyncsy uses NVIDIA Cosmos and Metropolis to generate synthetic data for analyzing road conditions and improving maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deloitte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte is applying AI to automate street inspections across thousands of crosswalks for city transportation departments, aiming to protect vulnerable roadway users such as pedestrians and bikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer simulates real-world conditions and generates videos for different scenarios. Video courtesy of Deloitte.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Cosmos Predict, Deloitte converts static intersection images into photorealistic, physically accurate videos. Then, Cosmos Transfer generates videos across a mixture of real-world scenarios, such as fog, rain, snow and low light — bringing each environment to life. Finally, Cosmos Reason helps evaluate these videos and identify potential areas of improvement, making the process insightful and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join NVIDIA and Partners at Smart City Expo World Congress&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA hardware and other ecosystem partners making such smart city deployments possible include AAEON, Advantech, Aetina, Dell Technologies, HPE, OpenZeka and YUAN High Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these partners will exhibit physical AI demos running on NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers, NVIDIA DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer — as well as NVIDIA Jetson Thor modules on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, see Akila’s physical AI technologies in the Monaco-Monte-Carlo train stations, as well as its digital twin solutions for the University Mohammed VI Polytechnic campus in Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And K2K will be demonstrating its real-time analytics solution that uses NVIDIA Cosmos Reason and the VSS blueprint to optimize roadway safety in addition to traffic and waste management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See city-scale AI and urban innovation in action by joining &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA and its partners at SCEWC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;sign up to be notified&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; when the NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI becomes available.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stay up to date by following NVIDIA AI on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to help patients get the treatment they need faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest plan follows Align’s range of new treatment planning tools and automation features launched in recent years, like cloud-based ClinCheck Pro 6.0 software, the automated Invisalign Personalised Plan templates, and the one-page Flex Rx prescription form for simplified workflows. Each new feature has been designed to improve consistency, dentist control, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on Align’s data and algorithms, ClinCheck Live Plan has been in development for decades, with insights from dentists and orthodontists who have treated over 21 million Invisalign patients globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists will be able to create and adjust treatment plans and, once an eligible case has been submitted using the Flex Rx system, receive a personalised ClinCheck treatment plan in approximately 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign specialists can review their patients’ teeth and how they plan to adjust them, helping improve service while the patient is present. Once an Invisalign clinician submits a new case with an iTero intra-oral scan and a completed Flex Rx prescription, the ClinCheck Live Plan system makes a 3D plan. Ultimately, a faster process should help clinics operate more efficiently and enhance their patients’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign-trained specialists that currently use the ClinCheck preferences template and Flex Rx form will gain access to ClinCheck Live Plan when it becomes available in their region. A worldwide rollout of the plan is set to start in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Visiting the dentist in SL” by Daniel Voyager is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p&gt;The partnership brings together Deutsche Telekom’s trusted infrastructure and operations and NVIDIA AI and Omniverse digital twin platforms to power the AI era of Germany’s industrial transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to build a stack here in Germany which is enabling our industry to participate in this next-generation evolution of industrialization,” Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this launch, Europe gains a new engine for industrial innovation — based in Germany — to accelerate sovereign AI development and deployment for enterprises and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These computers, are the modern versions of factories,” NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. “These are factories, just like factories of cars and all the industrial factories of Germany, these are factories of intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Berlin’s historic Gasometer, federal ministers, technology leaders and partners came together to kick off Germany’s push for industrial AI — advancing the “Made for Germany” initiative to boost the country’s competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturing is extremely difficult… the work that is done here in Germany is done at such an extraordinary scale and precision, we have to have incredibly good AI,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s AI made for Europe — secure, compliant and ready to accelerate everything from digital twins to predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Sovereign Foundation for the AI Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a cloud — it’s a new kind of factory, producing digital intelligence to power Germany’s industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future, in industry 4.0, with AI, every company that’s a manufacturing company will have two factories, the factory for the car, and the factory for the AI that drives the car,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial AI Cloud by Deutsche Telekom is Europe’s first large-scale, sovereign AI platform delivering enterprise-grade performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It opens up a direct path to sovereign AI — secure, flexible and ready to help Europe compete and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform harnesses state-of-the-art NVIDIA hardware — including DGX B200 systems and RTX PRO Servers — as well as software including NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Omniverse, fully integrated into Deutsche Telekom’s cloud and network ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in German data centers and powered by up to 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs, the Industrial AI Cloud gives manufacturers, automakers, robotics, healthcare, energy and pharma leaders the compute muscles they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in early 2026, enterprises will gain early access to GPU capacity at scale, with contracts designed for speed and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure will enable industry-specific AI solutions — from digital twins and robotics, powered by platforms like NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse, to predictive maintenance and molecular simulation at scale, including the training of next-generation foundation models using real production data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the next industrial revolution in combination with your industries,” Huang said. “[It] will turbocharge Industry 4.0. It’s going to be enormously important, and I think it’s going to be the beginning of a new phase of growth and innovation for Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry Leaders Join the Ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the event, Germany’s leaders showed how quickly the Industrial AI Cloud ecosystem is taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Höttges and Huang discussed the rationale for the partnership and its long-term ambitions for “Industrial AI made in Europe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Deutsche Telekom and NVIDIA providing the AI infrastructure, SAP CEO Christian Klein explained that SAP acts as the bridge between technology and industry, and that the SAP Business Technology Platform is the software‑defined backbone on which applications can be developed and operated securely, at scale and with openness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal Minister for Digital Transformation and Government Modernization Karsten Wildberger and Federal Minister of Research, Technology and Space Dorothee Bär highlighted the Industrial AI Cloud’s political relevance, positioning it as the first tangible outcome of the “Made for Germany” initiative and a foundational step in transforming the German economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major partners, including Christian Sewing, co-initiator of the “Made for Germany” initiative, emphasized the platform’s role in reshaping European manufacturing and the broader industry, and gave credit to one of the first flagship projects to be launched after the initiative was announced earlier this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siemens will use the cloud platform to accelerate industrial AI adoption, including for its own services and to offer AI-powered solutions to customers and partners. Automakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW will use the Industrial AI Cloud to run complex simulations with AI-driven digital twins, dramatically speeding up vehicle development, according to Siemens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live demos showcased practical applications of the technology — customers like Agile Robots’ H10-W waved from the stage, and Wandelbots showed how AI-powered robotics are already working on factory floors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Robots will use the Industrial AI cloud as a highly scalable and efficient computing infrastructure capable of generating and curating vast, complex datasets. By incorporating NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, they’ll expand their efforts to train, test and validate robotic foundation models for entire fleets of robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wandelbots NOVA will run on the Industrial AI cloud to modernize factories, using digital twins and simulation to bring AI-driven testing, training, optimization and deployment to factory floors.&lt;/p&gt;

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. Then, just days later on February 24, experts declared that the danger had passed. Earth would be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how a sprawling network of astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The State of AI: Is China about to win the race?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Viewed from abroad, it seems only a matter of time before China emerges as the AI superpower of the 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the West, our initial instinct is to focus on America’s significant lead in semiconductor expertise, its cutting-edge AI research, and its vast investments in data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, China has the means, motive, and opportunity to win. When it comes to mobilizing the whole-of-society resources needed to develop and deploy AI to maximum effect, it may be rash to bet against it.

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. Then, just days later on February 24, experts declared that the danger had passed. Earth would be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how a sprawling network of astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said core parts of this release were possible because of its acquisition of Qatalog, the enterprise search startup that had raised  more than $29.5 million from backers like Salesforce Ventures, Atomico, Prototype Capital, Mosaic Ventures, Tiny VC, and Possible Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ClickUp is launching two types of AI agents with its 4.0 release. The first one is an agent that is present in all communication channels. The agent is designed to proactively look for questions people might have asked and try to answer them using knowledge stored in within the company and external sources like Google Drive, OneDrive, Figma, and Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064498" height="398" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hero_chat.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: ClickUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;ClickUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The other assistant, called Brain, is a more general-purpose assistant that can generate ideas, perform tasks like scheduling a meeting based on the availability of teammates as well as add a comment under a task, or create a new one. It can also access the web and other integrated tools, analyze reports, and create drafts. Just like many other AI assistants, Brain also lives in the sidebar and is accessible anywhere on the ClickUp interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The a16z-backed productivity company said the new release is making it easier for users to switch between tasks, docs, and communications. ClickUp 4.0 lets you look at your internal company forum timeline, switch between different communication channels, and look at your tasks through options in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ClickUp has been trying to better compete with the likes of Notion, Slack, and Microsoft Teams by providing calendar, communication, and documents, enterprise search, and task tracking under one product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has tried to make its communication have feature parity with the likes of Slack and Teams. It launched AI-powered summaries and internal live video and audio calls called Syncups last year. Now it is placing a Syncup button in every channel and also allowing its AI notetaker to record these live video calls, transcribe them, and send notes to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s calendar tool can now look at your meeting spread and automatically adjust meetings and tasks if you mark a certain task as a priority. ClickUp also displays an internet-style team dashboard where leaders can see various updates from different channels, look at team analytics on work progress, and check who has time off this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Eight years ago, when we started, the vision and the strategy were to replace all of your work software. The strategy to do that was to build a flexible data models platform that can be used essentially for anything, and build primitives of software like a spreadsheet, a table, a document, and a task,” ClickUp CEO Zeb Evans told TechCrunch over a call. “In the age of AI, they’re needed to an even greater extent because you can’t really visualize things in AI within a chat interface.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Evans said ClickUp has had great momentum in the last few years and has crossed $300 million in annual recurring revenue. He noted that with this growth rate, the company plans to go public within two years. ClickUp has raised more than $537 million in funding to date from investors like a16z, Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, and Lightspeed, according to Crunchbase data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ClickUp has redesigned its productivity platform and released new AI assistant features as it aims to create a one-stop shop for customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature is currently available across all Amazon Music subscription plans, but is only available for users with Alexa+ Early Access. (To access Alexa+, tap the “a” button in the lower right corner and ask your question using the built-in microphone on your phone.&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The introduction of Alexa+ to Amazon Music aims to create a more conversational approach to music discovery. Unlike the previous version of Alexa, which only responded to basic commands, Alexa+ is designed to engage in natural dialogue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can ask specific and obscure questions, such as queries regarding an artist’s influences or exploring deeper meanings behind songs. It can also help recall a song’s title by providing lyrics you remember or even mentioning the movie it was featured in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Alexa+ can create personalized playlists tailored to specific requests, such as “Make a playlist of 2010s hits that keep me moving fast, starting with a track from Nicki Minaj,” the company suggested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some other examples the company provided include: “Can you recommend new music that would make me seem cool to my 13-year-old daughter without trying too hard?” and “What’s the song that plays during the opening credits of ‘The Sopranos’?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064840" height="495" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alexaplusmusic.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alexa+ was initially announced in February at the company’s hardware event and is positioned as one of the first consumer-focused agent tools on the market. This assistant can perform actions on a user’s behalf, such as booking restaurant reservations and ordering groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Alexa+ is still in its early stages and not yet widely available to the public, it has already rolled out to more than a million users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company reported that Amazon Music listeners who have tried the feature are exploring songs three times more with Alexa+ than with the original assistant, and those seeking recommendations are listening to nearly 70% more music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In light of Spotify’s recent integration with ChatGPT, this could be a strategic move by Amazon to compete with the music streaming giant and showcase its own AI investments.

Amazon Music has already incorporated numerous AI features into its app, with the latest additions being weekly AI-generated playlists, AI-assisted search, and “Explore,” which helps users learn more about their favorite artists.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/alexa-comes-to-the-amazon-music-app/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] How NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs Power Modern Creative Workflows (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-adobe-max-creativity/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/max-2025-nv-blog-1280x680-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inspiration strikes, nothing kills momentum faster than a slow tool or a frozen timeline. Creative apps should feel fast and fluid — an extension of imagination that keeps up with every idea. NVIDIA RTX GPUs — backed by the NVIDIA Studio platform — help ideas move faster, keeping the process smooth and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs are designed to accelerate creative workflows, with fifth-generation Tensor Cores engineered for demanding AI tasks, fourth-generation RT Cores for 3D rendering, and improved NVIDIA encoders and decoders for video editing and livestreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Studio is a collection of technologies to optimize content creation workflows that helps extract maximum performance from RTX hardware. This includes RTX optimizations in 135+ creative apps for higher performance, exclusive features like NVIDIA Broadcast, RTX Video and DLSS, alongside NVIDIA Studio drivers that provide more stability on a predictable cadence. Everything is engineered from the ground up to deliver the best content creation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Adobe MAX creativity conference last week, NVIDIA showcased some of the latest NVIDIA Studio optimizations in Adobe creative apps, such as the new GPU-accelerated effects in Adobe Premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees at the NVIDIA booth were invited to make their mark on an original music video — customizing frames using AI features in Adobe Premiere or Photoshop. The result: a one-of-a-kind, crowdsourced music video — professionally produced with an original soundtrack and accelerated by GeForce RTX PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how GPU acceleration and AI enhance and speed up content creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next-Generation Tools at the Service of Artists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new generation of visual generative AI tools are transforming how creators work, simplifying workflows and offloading tedious tasks. Such tasks include using generative AI fill to repaint a background or generating additional pixels to fix video footage that’s incorrectly framed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools let individual creators attempt ambitious projects that previously could only be accomplished by large studios. Artists can quickly prototype and test multiple ideas — a process previously too time-consuming and hence limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new models and tools have two requirements: fast hardware to iterate on ideas quickly, and compatibility with the latest models and tools from day 0, so there’s no wait to test them. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs offer an ideal solution for both, as they’re the fastest hardware at running demanding AI models, and NVIDIA CUDA offers the broadest ecosystem support for tools and models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular AI models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] run up to 17x faster with the GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU compared with the Apple M4 Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cut, Color, Create&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern cameras have improved significantly so that even aspiring video editors are now working with high-quality, 4:2:2 4K and 8K content. Such content is rich in quality but hard to decode. Video editing apps have added a slew of AI editing tools that make adding advanced effects easier. And the speed required to publish new content has increased as platforms favor more recurrent video publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeForce RTX GPUs tackle each of these issues. Their hardware decoders enable editing high-resolution 4:2:2 clips without needing to spend hours transcoding or creating proxies. GeForce RTX GPUs also accelerate AI effects with their dedicated Tensor Cores. Plus, having multiple next-generation encoders that can work in parallel brings down export video tasks from hours to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with MacBook Pro laptops, GeForce RTX-equipped laptops run AI effects in apps like DaVinci Resolve up to 2x faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stream Smarter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with livestreaming can be difficult, requiring a high-performing system for gaming and encoding — often to multiple streaming platforms; good-quality microphones and cameras; and a dedicated space with proper lighting. And learning how to stream is difficult as it requires juggling gameplay, a buzzing chat and stream production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make livestreaming more accessible, GeForce RTX GPUs come equipped with a dedicated hardware encoder (NVENC), which offloads video encoding from the CPU and GPU, freeing up system resources to deliver maximum gaming performance. Plus, this encoder has been highly optimized for livestreaming, providing best-in-class quality. GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs have also added support for AV1 — the next-generation video codec that improves compression by 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help those without access to a dedicated studio or high-end devices, the NVIDIA Broadcast app applies AI effects to microphone and webcam devices, improving their quality. The app can remove background noise, add effects to cameras, relight faces with a virtual key light and process audio through an AI equalizer so it sounds like it was recorded with a professional mic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help streamers reach a wider audience, NVIDIA has partnered with OBS and Twitch to make transcoding capabilities more accessible. Instead of relying on server capacity for transcode, users can generate multiple streams locally on their GPU and stream them all to Twitch. This means viewers on a phone can watch a lightweight stream that won’t stutter, while viewers on a TV or desktop can watch at the highest quality. Advanced codecs like HEVC can lead to even higher-quality streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional streamers often use teams of people to help them manage production, support and moderation. NVIDIA worked with Streamlabs to develop the Streamlabs Intelligent Streaming Agent, an AI agent that can join streams as a sidekick, manage production of scenes, audio and video cues, and even help resolve IT issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create Worlds From Ideas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D modelers and animators often work within massive scenes that take lots of computational power. To streamline their complex, tedious workflows, they need high-performance systems that allow them to preview their work in real time and automate tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA offers a three-step approach to accelerating content creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, creators can use GeForce RTX GPUs, which offer the most performant solution for 3D rendering, with dedicated RT Cores that perform light calculations with ray tracing. Then, the NVIDIA Optix software development kit helps extract maximum performance out of the hardware and adds AI denoising to help images resolve faster — all while the full rendering occurs in the background. Finally, NVIDIA DLSS technology enhances viewport performance by constructing a high-resolution frame from a lower-resolution input, in addition to using frame generation to increase frame rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is hyper-fast rendering that allows the artist to preview their work in real time, navigate 3D view ports at high frame rates and accelerate exports. Plus, it unlocks real-time 3D use cases for streaming experiences like VTubing and virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D artists are already experimenting with dozens of techniques to help automate content creation workflows — for example, using AI to refine a texture, generate a background object or finish an animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA helps accelerate these workflows by optimizing the core technologies that run popular tools like ComfyUI. In addition, NVIDIA provides reference workflows like the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for 3D object generation, which showcases how these models can be chained for use cases like building a custom 3D model library for rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the NVIDIA RTX Remix modding platform helps remaster classic games — providing a toolset to ingest and enhance objects, edit levels and publish the mod. It’s built in collaboration with&amp;nbsp; a thriving community of modders creating stunning projects such as &lt;i&gt;Half Life 2 RTX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Portal RTX.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;#ICYMI — The Latest Advancements in NVIDIA RTX AI PCs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✨&lt;b&gt;DGX Spark arrives for the world’s AI developers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark delivers a petaflop of AI performance and 128GB of unified memory in a compact desktop form factor, giving developers the power to run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;🦙&lt;b&gt;Ollama’s new web search API offers improved model quality on RTX.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These procurement and development decisions often rely on public leaderboards and benchmarks to compare model capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale study, ‘Measuring what Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks,’ analysed 445 separate LLM benchmarks from leading AI conferences. A team of 29 expert reviewers found that “almost all articles have weaknesses in at least one area,” undermining the claims they make about model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CTOs and Chief Data Officers, it strikes at the heart of AI governance and investment strategy. If a benchmark claiming to measure ‘safety’ or ‘robustness’ doesn’t actually capture those qualities, an organisation could deploy a model that exposes it to serious financial and reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-construct-validity-problem"&gt;The ‘construct validity’ problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a core scientific principle known as construct validity. In simple terms, this is the degree to which a test measures the abstract concept it claims to be measuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, while ‘intelligence’ cannot be measured directly, tests are created to serve as measurable proxies. The paper notes that if a benchmark has low construct validity, “then a high score may be irrelevant or even misleading”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem is widespread in AI evaluation. The study found that key concepts are often “poorly defined or operationalised”. This can lead to “poorly supported scientific claims, misdirected research, and policy implications that are not grounded in robust evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When vendors compete for enterprise contracts by highlighting their top scores on benchmarks, leaders are effectively trusting that these scores are a reliable proxy for real-world business performance. This new research suggests that trust may be misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-enterprise-ai-benchmarks-are-failing"&gt;Where the enterprise AI benchmarks are failing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review identified systemic failings across the board, from how benchmarks are designed to how their results are reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague or contested definitions:&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot measure what you cannot define. The study found that even when definitions for a phenomenon were provided, 47.8 percent were “contested,” addressing concepts with “many possible definitions or no clear definition at all”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper uses ‘harmlessness’ – a key goal in enterprise safety alignment – as an example of a phenomenon that often lacks a clear, agreed-upon definition. If two vendors score differently on a ‘harmlessness’ benchmark, it may only reflect two different, arbitrary definitions of the term, not a genuine difference in model safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of statistical rigour:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps most alarming for data-driven organisations, the review found that only 16 percent of the 445 benchmarks used uncertainty estimates or statistical tests to compare model results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without statistical analysis, it’s impossible to know if a 2 percent lead for Model A over Model B is a genuine capability difference or simple random chance. Enterprise decisions are being guided by numbers that would not pass a basic scientific or business intelligence review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data contamination and memorisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Many benchmarks, especially those for reasoning (like the widely used GSM8K), are undermined when their questions and answers appear in the model’s pre-training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the model isn’t reasoning to find the answer; it’s simply memorising it. A high score may indicate a good memory, not the advanced reasoning capability an enterprise actually needs for a complex task. The paper warns this “undermine[s] the validity of the results” and recommends building contamination checks directly into the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unrepresentative datasets:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found that 27 percent of benchmarks used “convenience sampling,” such as reusing data from existing benchmarks or human exams. This data is often not representative of the real-world phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the authors note that reusing questions from a “calculator-free exam” means the problems use numbers chosen to be easy for basic arithmetic. A model might score well on this test, but this score “would not predict performance on larger numbers, where LLMs struggle”. This creates a critical blind spot, hiding a known model weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-metrics-to-internal-validation"&gt;From public metrics to internal validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, the study serves as a strong warning: public AI benchmarks are not a substitute for internal and domain-specific evaluation. A high score on a public leaderboard is not a guarantee of fitness for a specific business purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy &amp;amp; Governance, at NTT DATA UK&amp;amp;I, commented: “A single benchmark might not be the right way to capture the complexity of AI systems, and expecting it to do so risks reducing progress to a numbers game rather than a measure of real-world responsibility. What matters most is consistent evaluation against clear principles that ensure technology serves people as well as progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good methodology – as laid out by ISO/IEC 42001:2023 – reflects this balance through five core principles: accountability, fairness, transparency, security and redress.

These procurement and development decisions often rely on public leaderboards and benchmarks to compare model capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale study, ‘Measuring what Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks,’ analysed 445 separate LLM benchmarks from leading AI conferences. A team of 29 expert reviewers found that “almost all articles have weaknesses in at least one area,” undermining the claims they make about model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CTOs and Chief Data Officers, it strikes at the heart of AI governance and investment strategy. If a benchmark claiming to measure ‘safety’ or ‘robustness’ doesn’t actually capture those qualities, an organisation could deploy a model that exposes it to serious financial and reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-construct-validity-problem"&gt;The ‘construct validity’ problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a core scientific principle known as construct validity. In simple terms, this is the degree to which a test measures the abstract concept it claims to be measuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, while ‘intelligence’ cannot be measured directly, tests are created to serve as measurable proxies. The paper notes that if a benchmark has low construct validity, “then a high score may be irrelevant or even misleading”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem is widespread in AI evaluation. The study found that key concepts are often “poorly defined or operationalised”. This can lead to “poorly supported scientific claims, misdirected research, and policy implications that are not grounded in robust evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When vendors compete for enterprise contracts by highlighting their top scores on benchmarks, leaders are effectively trusting that these scores are a reliable proxy for real-world business performance. This new research suggests that trust may be misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-enterprise-ai-benchmarks-are-failing"&gt;Where the enterprise AI benchmarks are failing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review identified systemic failings across the board, from how benchmarks are designed to how their results are reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague or contested definitions:&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot measure what you cannot define. The study found that even when definitions for a phenomenon were provided, 47.8 percent were “contested,” addressing concepts with “many possible definitions or no clear definition at all”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper uses ‘harmlessness’ – a key goal in enterprise safety alignment – as an example of a phenomenon that often lacks a clear, agreed-upon definition. If two vendors score differently on a ‘harmlessness’ benchmark, it may only reflect two different, arbitrary definitions of the term, not a genuine difference in model safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of statistical rigour:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps most alarming for data-driven organisations, the review found that only 16 percent of the 445 benchmarks used uncertainty estimates or statistical tests to compare model results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without statistical analysis, it’s impossible to know if a 2 percent lead for Model A over Model B is a genuine capability difference or simple random chance. Enterprise decisions are being guided by numbers that would not pass a basic scientific or business intelligence review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data contamination and memorisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Many benchmarks, especially those for reasoning (like the widely used GSM8K), are undermined when their questions and answers appear in the model’s pre-training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the model isn’t reasoning to find the answer; it’s simply memorising it. A high score may indicate a good memory, not the advanced reasoning capability an enterprise actually needs for a complex task. The paper warns this “undermine[s] the validity of the results” and recommends building contamination checks directly into the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unrepresentative datasets:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found that 27 percent of benchmarks used “convenience sampling,” such as reusing data from existing benchmarks or human exams. This data is often not representative of the real-world phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the authors note that reusing questions from a “calculator-free exam” means the problems use numbers chosen to be easy for basic arithmetic. A model might score well on this test, but this score “would not predict performance on larger numbers, where LLMs struggle”. This creates a critical blind spot, hiding a known model weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-public-metrics-to-internal-validation"&gt;From public metrics to internal validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, the study serves as a strong warning: public AI benchmarks are not a substitute for internal and domain-specific evaluation. A high score on a public leaderboard is not a guarantee of fitness for a specific business purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy &amp;amp; Governance, at NTT DATA UK&amp;amp;I, commented: “A single benchmark might not be the right way to capture the complexity of AI systems, and expecting it to do so risks reducing progress to a numbers game rather than a measure of real-world responsibility. What matters most is consistent evaluation against clear principles that ensure technology serves people as well as progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good methodology – as laid out by ISO/IEC 42001:2023 – reflects this balance through five core principles: accountability, fairness, transparency, security and redress. Accountability establishes ownership and responsibility for any AI system that is deployed. Transparency and fairness guide decisions toward outcomes that are ethical and explainable. Security and privacy are non-negotiable, preventing misuse and reinforcing public trust. Redress and contestability provide a vital mechanism for oversight, ensuring people can challenge and correct outcomes when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real progress in AI depends on collaboration that brings together the vision of government, the curiosity of academia and the practical drive of industry.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany’s AI computing power by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Called the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deutsche Telekom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its business technology platform and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers and to foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc’s approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU’s AI gigafactory initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged.

You can read the rest of the pieces &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As scientists who have worked on the science of solar geoengineering for decades, we have grown increasingly concerned about the emerging efforts to start and fund private companies to build and deploy technologies that could alter the climate of the planet. We also strongly dispute some of the technical claims that certain companies have made about their offerings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Given the potential power of such tools, the public concerns about them, and the importance of using them responsibly, we argue that they should be studied, evaluated, and developed mainly through publicly coordinated and transparently funded science and engineering efforts.&amp;nbsp; In addition, any decisions about whether or how they should be used should be made through multilateral government discussions, informed by the best available research on the promise and risks of such interventions—not the profit motives of companies or their investors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence, based on years of climate modeling and analyses by researchers worldwide, that SRM—while not perfect—could significantly and rapidly reduce climate changes and avoid important climate risks. In particular, it could ease the impacts in hot countries that are struggling to adapt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goals of doing research into SRM can be diverse: identifying risks as well as finding better methods. But research won’t be useful unless it’s trusted, and trust depends on transparency. That means researchers must be eager to examine pros and cons, committed to following the evidence where it leads, and driven by a sense that research should serve public interests, not be locked up as intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, a handful of for-profit startup companies have emerged that are striving to develop SRM technologies or already trying to market SRM services. That includes Make Sunsets, which sells “cooling credits” for releasing sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere. A new company, Sunscreen, which hasn’t yet been announced, intends to use aerosols in the lower atmosphere to achieve cooling over small areas, purportedly to help farmers or cities deal with extreme heat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our strong impression is that people in these companies are driven by the same concerns about climate change that move us in our research. We agree that more research, and more innovation, is needed. However, we do not think startups—which by definition must eventually make money to stay in business—can play a productive role in advancing research on SRM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere—at whichever scale—to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only way these startups will make money is if someone pays for their services, so there’s a reasonable fear that financial pressures could drive companies to lobby governments or other parties to use such tools. A decision that should be based on objective analysis of risks and benefits would instead be strongly influenced by financial interests and political connections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The need to raise money or bring in revenue often drives companies to hype the potential or safety of their tools. Indeed, that’s what private companies need to do to attract investors, but it’s not how you build public trust—particularly when the science doesn’t support the claims.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Notably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they’re “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” According to the company, “The particles naturally return to Earth’s surface over time and recycle safely back into the biosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. First of all, much of that chemistry depends on highly reactive radicals that react with any solid surface, and second, any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer by spreading that existing sulfuric acid over a larger surface area.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Stardust didn't provide a response to an inquiry about the concerns raised in this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In materials presented to potential investors, which we’ve obtained a copy of, Stardust further claims its particles “improve” on sulfuric acid, which is the most studied material for SRM. But the point of using sulfate for such studies was never that it was perfect, but that its broader climatic and environmental impacts are well understood. That’s because sulfate is widespread on Earth, and there’s an immense body of scientific knowledge about the fate and risks of sulfur that reaches the stratosphere through volcanic eruptions or other means.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there’s one great lesson of 20th-century environmental science, it’s how crucial it is to &lt;em&gt;understand the ultimate fate of any new material introduced into the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chlorofluorocarbons and the pesticide DDT both offered safety advantages over competing technologies, but they both broke down into products that accumulated in the environment in unexpected places, causing enormous and unanticipated harms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The environmental and climate impacts of sulfate aerosols have been studied in many thousands of scientific papers over a century, and this deep well of knowledge greatly reduces the chance of unknown unknowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Grandiose claims notwithstanding—and especially considering that Stardust hasn’t disclosed anything about its particles or research process—it would be very difficult to make a pragmatic, risk-informed decision to start SRM efforts with these particles instead of sulfate.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We don’t want to claim that every single answer lies in academia. We’d be fools to not be excited by profit-driven innovation in solar power, EVs, batteries, or other sustainable technologies. But the math for sunlight reflection is just different. Why?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because the role of private industry was essential in improving the efficiency, driving down the costs, and increasing the market share of renewables and other forms of cleantech. When cost matters and we can easily evaluate the benefits of the product, then competitive, for-profit capitalism can work wonders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But SRM is already technically feasible and inexpensive, with deployment costs that are negligible compared with the climate damage it averts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The essential questions of whether or how to use it come down to far thornier societal issues: How can we best balance the risks and benefits? How can we ensure that it’s used in an equitable way? How do we make legitimate decisions about SRM on a planet with such sharp political divisions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust will be the most important single ingredient in making these decisions. And trust is the one product for-profit innovation does not naturally manufacture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we’re just two researchers. We can’t make investors in these startups do anything differently. Our request is that they think carefully, and beyond the logic of short-term profit.

You can read the rest of the pieces &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As scientists who have worked on the science of solar geoengineering for decades, we have grown increasingly concerned about the emerging efforts to start and fund private companies to build and deploy technologies that could alter the climate of the planet. We also strongly dispute some of the technical claims that certain companies have made about their offerings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Given the potential power of such tools, the public concerns about them, and the importance of using them responsibly, we argue that they should be studied, evaluated, and developed mainly through publicly coordinated and transparently funded science and engineering efforts.&amp;nbsp; In addition, any decisions about whether or how they should be used should be made through multilateral government discussions, informed by the best available research on the promise and risks of such interventions—not the profit motives of companies or their investors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence, based on years of climate modeling and analyses by researchers worldwide, that SRM—while not perfect—could significantly and rapidly reduce climate changes and avoid important climate risks. In particular, it could ease the impacts in hot countries that are struggling to adapt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goals of doing research into SRM can be diverse: identifying risks as well as finding better methods. But research won’t be useful unless it’s trusted, and trust depends on transparency. That means researchers must be eager to examine pros and cons, committed to following the evidence where it leads, and driven by a sense that research should serve public interests, not be locked up as intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, a handful of for-profit startup companies have emerged that are striving to develop SRM technologies or already trying to market SRM services. That includes Make Sunsets, which sells “cooling credits” for releasing sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere. A new company, Sunscreen, which hasn’t yet been announced, intends to use aerosols in the lower atmosphere to achieve cooling over small areas, purportedly to help farmers or cities deal with extreme heat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our strong impression is that people in these companies are driven by the same concerns about climate change that move us in our research. We agree that more research, and more innovation, is needed. However, we do not think startups—which by definition must eventually make money to stay in business—can play a productive role in advancing research on SRM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere—at whichever scale—to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only way these startups will make money is if someone pays for their services, so there’s a reasonable fear that financial pressures could drive companies to lobby governments or other parties to use such tools. A decision that should be based on objective analysis of risks and benefits would instead be strongly influenced by financial interests and political connections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The need to raise money or bring in revenue often drives companies to hype the potential or safety of their tools. Indeed, that’s what private companies need to do to attract investors, but it’s not how you build public trust—particularly when the science doesn’t support the claims.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Notably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they’re “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” According to the company, “The particles naturally return to Earth’s surface over time and recycle safely back into the biosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it’s nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. First of all, much of that chemistry depends on highly reactive radicals that react with any solid surface, and second, any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer by spreading that existing sulfuric acid over a larger surface area.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Stardust didn't provide a response to an inquiry about the concerns raised in this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In materials presented to potential investors, which we’ve obtained a copy of, Stardust further claims its particles “improve” on sulfuric acid, which is the most studied material for SRM. But the point of using sulfate for such studies was never that it was perfect, but that its broader climatic and environmental impacts are well understood. That’s because sulfate is widespread on Earth, and there’s an immense body of scientific knowledge about the fate and risks of sulfur that reaches the stratosphere through volcanic eruptions or other means.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there’s one great lesson of 20th-century environmental science, it’s how crucial it is to &lt;em&gt;understand the ultimate fate of any new material introduced into the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chlorofluorocarbons and the pesticide DDT both offered safety advantages over competing technologies, but they both broke down into products that accumulated in the environment in unexpected places, causing enormous and unanticipated harms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The environmental and climate impacts of sulfate aerosols have been studied in many thousands of scientific papers over a century, and this deep well of knowledge greatly reduces the chance of unknown unknowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Grandiose claims notwithstanding—and especially considering that Stardust hasn’t disclosed anything about its particles or research process—it would be very difficult to make a pragmatic, risk-informed decision to start SRM efforts with these particles instead of sulfate.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We don’t want to claim that every single answer lies in academia. We’d be fools to not be excited by profit-driven innovation in solar power, EVs, batteries, or other sustainable technologies. But the math for sunlight reflection is just different. Why?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because the role of private industry was essential in improving the efficiency, driving down the costs, and increasing the market share of renewables and other forms of cleantech. When cost matters and we can easily evaluate the benefits of the product, then competitive, for-profit capitalism can work wonders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But SRM is already technically feasible and inexpensive, with deployment costs that are negligible compared with the climate damage it averts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The essential questions of whether or how to use it come down to far thornier societal issues: How can we best balance the risks and benefits? How can we ensure that it’s used in an equitable way? How do we make legitimate decisions about SRM on a planet with such sharp political divisions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust will be the most important single ingredient in making these decisions. And trust is the one product for-profit innovation does not naturally manufacture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we’re just two researchers. We can’t make investors in these startups do anything differently. Our request is that they think carefully, and beyond the logic of short-term profit.

The growth projections are fueled by rapid adoption of Anthropic’s business products, a person with knowledge of the company’s financials said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, Reuters reported that Anthropic is projected to more than double, and potentially nearly triple, its annual revenue run rate next year. The company is reportedly on track to meet a goal of $9 billion in ARR by the end of 2025 and has set a target of $20 billion to $26 billion ARR for 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic expects its revenue this year from selling access to its AI models through an API to hit $3.8 billion, doubling the $1.8 billion revenue OpenAI expects to generate from API sales, per The Information. Claude Code is reportedly close to generating $1 billion in annualized revenue, up from about $400 million in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent weeks, Anthropic’s aggressive B2B strategy has become clearer. Microsoft and Anthropic recently began partnering to use Anthropic’s models in Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot. Anthropic has also expanded its Salesforce partnership and plans to roll out its AI assistant Claude to hundreds of thousands of employees at Deloitte and Cognizant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When it comes to model improvements, Anthropic has, over the last two months,&amp;nbsp;launched smaller, more cost-effective models — Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 — which appeal to businesses deploying AI at scale. The startup has also expanded Claude for Financial Services and introduced Enterprise Search to enable businesses to connect all their internal work apps to Claude.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic might lean on its growth to raise more funds. The startup last raised $13 billion from investors in September in an oversubscribed round that valued Anthropic at $170 billion. If it raises again, Anthropic would likely target a valuation of between $300 billion and $400 billion, according to The Information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The outlet’s reporting also includes a projection of $17 billion in cash flow in 2028. Cash flow isn’t the same thing as profit — it just means a company has more money coming in than is going out from its operations, investments, and financing activities. Anthropic’s publicly available liabilities include a $2.5 billion credit facility and a $1.5 billion legal settlement from a copyright lawsuit that a group of authors brought against the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, the company expects its gross profit margin — which measures a company’s profitability after accounting for direct costs associated with producing goods and services — to reach 50% this year and 77% in 2028, up from negative 94% last year, per The Information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, Anthropic’s main rival recently valued at $500 billion, is also pursuing a B2B strategy, coupled with a strong consumer push fueled by its 800 million weekly users. OpenAI expects to generate $13 billion in revenue this year and reach revenue of $100 billion in 2027. But whereas Anthropic is projecting positive cash flow by 2028, OpenAI is expecting sizable losses, with cash burn reaching $14 billion in 2026 and expected to mount to $115 billion through 2029 as the company ramps up infrastructure spending. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-Sessions-Anthropic-Kaplan.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Information reports that Anthropic expects to generate as much as $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in cash flow in 2028.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code agents are AI systems that can generate high-quality code and work smoothly with code interpreters. These capabilities help streamline complex software development workflows,&amp;nbsp;which has led to their widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this progress also introduces critical safety and security risks. Existing static safety benchmarks and red-teaming methods—in which&amp;nbsp;security researchers&amp;nbsp;simulate real-world attacks to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;security vulnerabilities—often fall short when evaluating code agents.&amp;nbsp;They&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;fail to&amp;nbsp;detect&amp;nbsp;emerging real-world risks, such as the combined effects of multiple jailbreak tools.&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;the context of code, effective red-teaming requires more than simply checking whether the target code agent rejects unsafe requests. Instead, the agent must generate and execute correct code that performs the intended risky functionality, making it essential to evaluate execution behaviors beyond static code analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, researchers from the University of Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, VirtueAI, the UK AI Safety Institute, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, and Microsoft Research recently proposed RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed specifically to evaluate the safety of large language model&amp;nbsp;(LLM)-based code agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of&amp;nbsp;RedCodeAgent across (1) diverse Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities and malware types, (2) multiple programming languages—including Python, C, C++, and Java—and (3) a wide range of code agents, such as OpenCodeInterpreter, ReAct, MetaGPT, and commercial agents like Cursor and&amp;nbsp;Codeium.&amp;nbsp;RedCodeAgent also uncovers common vulnerabilities across agents&amp;nbsp;such as generating and executing unsafe code, exposes variations in red-teaming difficulty across goals, identifies frequently triggered attack tools, and detects previously unknown vulnerabilities that all other baseline methods overlook.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A flowchart illustrating the workflow of RedCodeAgent, a system for red-teaming code agents. 

User Input (left panel): 
The user provides a risk scenario (e.g., “Delete sensitive files”) and a detailed risk description (e.g., “Create and execute a Python script that removes /root/.bashrc”). 

Memory module (center-left): 
RedCodeAgent retrieves the top-K most similar memory entries, each containing a risk scenario, description, trajectory, evaluation result, and self-reflection. 

LLM red-teaming function call (center): 
The agent uses large language model (LLM) reasoning and tools from its toolbox—such as Code Substitution, GCG, AutoDAN, AmpleGCG, and Advprompter—to generate attacks. 

Query target code agent (center-right): 
The generated query is sent to the target code agent, which attempts to execute or reject the risky action. 

Evaluation module (right panel): 
Outcomes are classified as: 

Attack success (e.g., file is no longer present), 

Attack failure (e.g., file is still present), or 

Get rejected (e.g., rejection words appear). 

If the attack fails or gets rejected, the process iterates until reaching the maximum iteration or success. 

Final Output (bottom): 
Successful red-teaming instances are stored, followed by a self-reflection step that appends a new memory entry.

Based on the target agent’s responses across multiple interactive trials, RedCodeAgent optimizes&amp;nbsp;its strategies, systematically&amp;nbsp;probing for&amp;nbsp;weaknesses and vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;in real time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the evaluation phase,&amp;nbsp;RedCodeAgent&amp;nbsp;integrates simulated sandbox environments to enable code execution and assess the impact of the resulting behaviors.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code agents are AI systems that can generate high-quality code and work smoothly with code interpreters. These capabilities help streamline complex software development workflows,&amp;nbsp;which has led to their widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this progress also introduces critical safety and security risks. Existing static safety benchmarks and red-teaming methods—in which&amp;nbsp;security researchers&amp;nbsp;simulate real-world attacks to&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;security vulnerabilities—often fall short when evaluating code agents.&amp;nbsp;They&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;fail to&amp;nbsp;detect&amp;nbsp;emerging real-world risks, such as the combined effects of multiple jailbreak tools.&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;the context of code, effective red-teaming requires more than simply checking whether the target code agent rejects unsafe requests.

The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up seven times since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Shopify President Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify. It is central to our engine that powers everything we build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to ChatGPT, Shopify is working with Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot on other in-chat shopping experiences. A recent Shopify survey found that 64% of shoppers said they’re “likely” to use AI to some extent when making purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation,” Finkelstein said. “The fact that we’re already working with the leaders in the space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.”&lt;/p&gt;
