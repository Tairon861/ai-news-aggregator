&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Monday, Google announced that AI Mode will now support Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese. The update follows last month’s rollout of the AI-powered experience to 180 new markets in English, after initially launching in the U.S. and later expanding to the U.K. and India.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With this expansion, more people can now use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language, while exploring the web more deeply,” said Hema Budaraju, VP of Product Management at Google Search, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First rolled out as an experiment to Google One AI Premium subscribers in March, AI Mode is Google’s answer to AI search platforms including Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. The feature utilizes a customized version of Gemini 2.5, featuring multimodal and reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In August, Google introduced agentic features in AI Mode, letting it find restaurant reservations, with support for local service appointments and event ticket bookings planned for the future. These updates are currently limited to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. and are available through the “Agentic capabilities in AI Mode” experiment in Labs. The Ultra tier costs $249.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, Google’s AI Mode is accessible via a dedicated tab on the search results page and a button in the search bar. The company appears to be working toward making this AI-led search experience the default “soon,” as indicated by Google DeepMind’s group product manager Logan Kilpatrick, while responding to a user post on X last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s recent AI updates, including AI Mode and AI Overviews, are criticized for affecting search clicks. However, Google last month denied that its AI search features are killing website traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founders Fund, the Peter Thiel-backed VC, led Cognition’s latest round, with participation from existing investors like Lux Capital, Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, Elad Gil, Definition Capital and Swish Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July, Cognition acquired AI coding startup Windsurf, just days after Google poached the startup’s CEO, co-founder, and research leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The raise comes after serious growth for Cognition’s core product.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Pinecone founder and CEO Edo Liberty will explain why the next wave of AI-native apps won’t be driven by bigger models, but by smarter search. With 10,000+ startup and VC leaders expected to be at Disrupt, &lt;strong&gt;this AI Stage fireside chat&lt;/strong&gt; and presentation is a must-attend session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-ai-isn-t-more-data-it-s-better-retrieval"&gt;The future of AI isn’t more data — it’s better retrieval&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AI becomes more embedded in every workflow, the real differentiator isn’t just the algorithm — it’s how you access and use the right data at the right time. Liberty believes that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and purpose-built infrastructure are the next frontier, and search is at the center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his session, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Why the Next Frontier Is Search&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; Liberty will unpack how vector databases and high-performance infrastructure are unlocking the full potential of AI. With so much data in play, knowing how to find what matters — fast — is everything. This talk goes deep into the stack that’s powering smarter, more scalable applications across industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liberty helped build the backbone of AI at Amazon, and now with Pinecone, he’s scaling next-gen search for hundreds of thousands of developers and enterprise teams. If you’re building with AI, this is your roadmap to where the ecosystem is heading next.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Is the web thriving or faltering? Google has an unexpected take in a new legal filing. Google is heading back to court soon in hopes of convincing a judge that it should not have to split up its ad business. The company lost its adtech antitrust case earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: "The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case declined to order that in the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition. The court in this case ruled that in tying its display ad services with the AdX marketplace, Google suppressed the adoption of rival technologies, and this gave it an opportunity to preference its own services in ad auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As users become increasingly frustrated with AI search products, Google often claims people actually love AI search and are sending as many clicks to the web as ever. Now that its golden goose is on the line, the open web is suddenly "in rapid decline." It's right there on page five of the company's September 5 filing, as spotted by Search Engine Roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis of AI Overviews web traffic from the Pew Research Center suggests AI Overviews results in a substantial drop in web traffic. Google executives have disputed this, claiming the search clicks are "relatively stable," according to search head Liz Reid. It feels like Google is trying to have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advertising and the open web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google objects to this characterization. A spokesperson calls it a "cherry-picked" line from the filing that has been misconstrued. Google's position is that the entire passage is referring to open-web &lt;em&gt;advertising&lt;/em&gt; rather than the open web itself. "Investments in non-open web display advertising like connected TV and retail media are growing at the expense of those in open web display advertising," says Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume this is true, it doesn't exactly let Google off the hook. As AI tools have proliferated, we've heard from Google time and time again that traffic from search to the web is healthy. When people use the web more, Google makes more money from all those eyeballs on ads, and indeed, Google's earnings have never been higher. However, Google isn't just putting ads on websites—Google is also big in mobile apps. As Google's own filings make clear, in-app ads are by far the largest growth sector in advertising. Meanwhile, time spent on non-social and non-video content is stagnant or slightly declining, and as a result, display ads on the open web earn less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whether Google's wording in the filing is meant to address the web or advertising on the web may be a distinction without a difference. If ads on websites aren't making the big bucks, Google's incentives will undoubtedly change. While Google says its increasingly AI-first search experience is still consistently sending traffic to websites, it has not released data to show that. If display ads are in "rapid decline," then it's not really in Google's interest to continue sending traffic to non-social and non-video content. Maybe it makes more sense to keep people penned up on its platform where they can interact with its AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the web isn't just ad-supported content—Google representatives have repeatedly trotted out the claim that Google's crawlers have seen a 45 percent increase in indexable content since 2023. This metric, Google says, shows that open web advertising could be imploding while the web is healthy and thriving. We don't know what kind of content is in this 45 percent, but given the timeframe cited, AI slop is a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the increasingly AI-heavy open web isn't worth advertisers' attention, is it really right to claim the web is thriving as Google so often does? Google's filing may simply be admitting to what we all know: the open web is supported by advertising, and ads increasingly can't pay the bills. And is that a thriving web? Not unless you count AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Is the web thriving or faltering? Google has an unexpected take in a new legal filing. Google is heading back to court soon in hopes of convincing a judge that it should not have to split up its ad business. The company lost its adtech antitrust case earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: "The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case declined to order that in the remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition. The court in this case ruled that in tying its display ad services with the AdX marketplace, Google suppressed the adoption of rival technologies, and this gave it an opportunity to preference its own services in ad auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As users become increasingly frustrated with AI search products, Google often claims people actually love AI search and are sending as many clicks to the web as ever. Now that its golden goose is on the line, the open web is suddenly "in rapid decline." It's right there on page five of the company's September 5 filing, as spotted by Search Engine Roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis of AI Overviews web traffic from the Pew Research Center suggests AI Overviews results in a substantial drop in web traffic. Google executives have disputed this, claiming the search clicks are "relatively stable," according to search head Liz Reid. It feels like Google is trying to have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advertising and the open web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google objects to this characterization. A spokesperson calls it a "cherry-picked" line from the filing that has been misconstrued. Google's position is that the entire passage is referring to open-web &lt;em&gt;advertising&lt;/em&gt; rather than the open web itself. "Investments in non-open web display advertising like connected TV and retail media are growing at the expense of those in open web display advertising," says Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume this is true, it doesn't exactly let Google off the hook. As AI tools have proliferated, we've heard from Google time and time again that traffic from search to the web is healthy. When people use the web more, Google makes more money from all those eyeballs on ads, and indeed, Google's earnings have never been higher. However, Google isn't just putting ads on websites—Google is also big in mobile apps. As Google's own filings make clear, in-app ads are by far the largest growth sector in advertising. Meanwhile, time spent on non-social and non-video content is stagnant or slightly declining, and as a result, display ads on the open web earn less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whether Google's wording in the filing is meant to address the web or advertising on the web may be a distinction without a difference. If ads on websites aren't making the big bucks, Google's incentives will undoubtedly change. While Google says its increasingly AI-first search experience is still consistently sending traffic to websites, it has not released data to show that. If display ads are in "rapid decline," then it's not really in Google's interest to continue sending traffic to non-social and non-video content. Maybe it makes more sense to keep people penned up on its platform where they can interact with its AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the web isn't just ad-supported content—Google representatives have repeatedly trotted out the claim that Google's crawlers have seen a 45 percent increase in indexable content since 2023. This metric, Google says, shows that open web advertising could be imploding while the web is healthy and thriving. We don't know what kind of content is in this 45 percent, but given the timeframe cited, AI slop is a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the increasingly AI-heavy open web isn't worth advertisers' attention, is it really right to claim the web is thriving as Google so often does? Google's filing may simply be admitting to what we all know: the open web is supported by advertising, and ads increasingly can't pay the bills. And is that a thriving web? Not unless you count AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The realization came while reading (and sharing) some posts from the r/Claudecode subreddit, which were praising OpenAI Codex. OpenAI launched the software programming service that takes on Anthropic’s Claude Code in May.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lately, that subreddit has been so filled with posts from self-proclaimed Code users announcing that they moved to Codex that one Reddit user even joked: “Is it possible to switch to codex without posting a topic on Reddit?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This left Altman wondering how many of those posts were from real humans. “I have had the strangest experience reading this: I assume it’s all fake/bots, even though in this case I know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real,” he confessed on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He then live-analyzed his reasoning. “I think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways, the hype cycle has a very ‘it’s so over/we’re so back’ extremism, optimization pressure from social platforms on juicing engagement and the related way that creator monetization works, other companies have astroturfed us so i’m extra sensitive to it, and a bunch more (including probably some bots).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To decode that a little, he’s accusing humans of starting to sound like LLMs, even though LLMs — spearheaded by OpenAI — were literally invented to mimic human communication, right down to the em dash. And OpenAI’s models definitely trained on Reddit, where Altman was a board member through 2022, and was disclosed as a large shareholder during the company’s IPO last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He makes a valid point that fandoms, led by extremely, always-on social media users, do tend to behave in odd ways. Many groups can devolve into hatefests if overrun by those venting frustrations to their brethren. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman also throws a dig at the incentives when social media sites and creators rely on engagement to make money. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But then Altman confesses that one of the reasons he thinks the pro-OpenAI posts in this subreddit might be bots is because OpenAI has also been “astroturfed.” That typically involves posts by people or bots paid for by the competitor, or paid by some third-degree contractor, giving the competitor plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We have no evidence of astroturfing (though it is possible). But we did see how OpenAI subreddits turned on the company after it released GPT 5.0. Instead of waves of praise from the faithful over the new model, many angry posts were voted up. People took to Reddit and X to complain about everything from GPT’s personality to how it burned through credits without finishing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A day after the bumpy release, Altman did a Reddit ask-me-anything session on r/GPT in which he confessed to rollout issues and promised changes. The GPT subreddit has never fully recovered its previous level of love, with users still posting regularly on how much they dislike the changes with GPT 5.0. Are they human? Or are they, as Altman seems to imply, fake in some way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman surmises, “The net effect is somehow AI twitter/AI Reddit feels very fake in a way it really didn’t a year or two ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If that’s true, who’s fault is it? GPT has led models to become so good at writing, that LLMs have become a plague not just to social media sites (which have always had a bot problem) but to schools, journalism, and the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know how many Reddit posts are written by bots, or are fictional accounts by humans using LLMs, it is likely a substantial number. Data security company Imperva reported that over half of all internet traffic in 2024 was non-human, largely due to LLMs. X’s own bot Grok says: “The exact numbers aren’t public, but 2024 estimates suggest hundreds of millions of bots on X.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several cynics have suggested that Altman’s lament was his first foray into marketing OpenAI’s rumored social media platform. In April, the Verge reported that such a project to take on X and Facebook was at the earliest stages. This product may or may not exist. Altman may or may not have had ulterior motives for suggesting that social media is too fake these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But motives aside, if OpenAI is planning a social network, what are the odds that it would be a bot-free zone? And, funny enough, if it did the reverse and banned humans, the results likely wouldn’t be different. Not only do LLMs still hallucinate facts, but when researchers at the University of Amsterdam built a social network composed entirely of bots, they found that the bots soon formed cliques and echo chambers for themselves, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2224158119.jpg?resize=1200,837" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;X enthusiast and Reddit shareholder Sam Altman had an epiphany on Monday: Bots have made it impossible to determine whether social media posts are really written by humans, he posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel announced Monday that Michelle Johnston Holthaus will depart the company after more than three decades. Johnston Holthhaus was most recently chief executive officer of Intel products and will remain a strategic adviser.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced the creation of a central engineering group that will build a new custom silicon business for outside customers, according to Intel.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel also said that Kevok Kechichian, formerly of ARM, will join the company as head of its data center group. Jim Johnson has been appointed senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s client computing group. Naga Chandrasekaran, the chief technology and operations officer of Intel Foundry, the company’s business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers, is also taking on an expanded role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers,” Tan said in a company press release. “We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence. Kevork, Jim, and Srini are exceptional leaders whose deep technical acumen and industry relationships will be instrumental as we continue building a new Intel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This news comes just a few weeks after the U.S. government announced a plan to convert existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These weren’t the only leadership changes at Intel this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tan taking over as CEO in March is a notable one. In July the company announced that it hired four new people for sales and engineering roles including Greg Ernst to serve as Intel’s chief revenue officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1831946092-e1732615535581.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Semiconductor giant Intel continues to shake up its senior leadership since Lip-Bu Tan took the helm as CEO in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel announced Monday that Michelle Johnston Holthaus will depart the company after more than three decades. Johnston Holthhaus was most recently chief executive officer of Intel products and will remain a strategic adviser.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced the creation of a central engineering group that will build a new custom silicon business for outside customers, according to Intel. This group will be helmed by Srinivasan “Srini” Iyengar who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel also said that Kevok Kechichian, formerly of ARM, will join the company as head of its data center group.
