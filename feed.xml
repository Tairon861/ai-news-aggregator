The desert sun is blinding as it reflects off the white salt that gathers and crunches underfoot like snow at the water’s edge. In a part of the lake too shallow for boats, bacteria have turned the water a Pepto-Bismol pink. The landscape all around is ringed with jagged red mountains and brown brush. The only obvious sign of people is the salt-encrusted hose running from the water’s edge to a makeshift encampment of shipping containers and trucks a few hundred feet away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This otherworldly scene is the test site for a company called Lilac Solutions, which is developing a technology it says will shake up the United States’ efforts to pry control over the global supply of lithium, the so-called “white gold” needed for electric vehicles and batteries, away from China. Before tearing down its demonstration facility to make way for its first commercial plant, due online next year, the company invited me to be the first journalist to tour its outpost in this remote area, a roughly two-hour drive from Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The startup is in a race to commercialize a new way to extract lithium from rocks, called direct lithium extraction (DLE). This approach is designed to reduce the environmental damage caused by the two most common traditional methods of mining lithium: hard-rock mining and brining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Australia, the world’s top producer of lithium, uses the first approach, scraping rocks laden with lithium out of the earth so they can be chemically processed into industrial-grade versions of the metal. Chile, the second-largest lithium source, uses the second: It floods areas of its sun-soaked Atacama Desert with water. This results in ponds rich in dissolved lithium, which are then allowed to dry off, leaving behind lithium salts that can be harvested and processed elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

While DLE has yet to take off, its reduced need for water and land has made it a prime focus for companies and governments looking to ramp up production to meet the growing demand for lithium as electric vehicles take off and even bigger batteries are increasingly used to back up power grids. China, which processes more than two-thirds of the world’s mined lithium, is developing its own DLE to increase domestic production of the raw material. New approaches are still being researched, but nearly a dozen companies are actively looking to commercialize DLE technology now, and some industrial giants already offer basic off-the-shelf hardware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In August, Lilac completed its most advanced test yet of its technology, which the company says doesn’t just require far less water than traditional lithium extraction—it uses a fraction of what other DLE approaches demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company uses proprietary beads to draw lithium ions from water and says its process can extract lithium using a tenth as much water as the alumina sorbent technology that dominates the DLE industry. Lilac also highlights its all-American supply chain. Technology originally developed by Koch Industries, for example, uses some Chinese-made components. Lilac’s beads are manufactured at the company’s plant in Nevada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lilac says the beads are particularly well suited to extracting lithium where concentrations are low.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That doesn’t mean they could be deployed just anywhere—there won’t be lithium extraction on the Hudson River anytime soon. But Lilac’s tech could offer significant advantages over what’s currently on the market. And forgoing plans to become a major producer itself could enable the company to seize a decent slice of global production by appealing to lithium miners companies looking for the best equipment, says Milo McBride, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who authored a recent report on DLE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If everything pans out, the pilot plant Lilac builds next to prove its technology at commercial scale could significantly increase domestic supply at a moment when the nation’s largest proposed lithium project, the controversial hard-rock Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, has faced fresh uncertainty. At the beginning of October, the Trump administration renegotiated a federal loan worth more than $2 billion to secure a 5% ownership stake for the US government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="walking path between several tall blue tanks connected by hose" class="wp-image-1124764" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9072.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The blue tank on the left filters the brine from the Great Salt Lake to remove large particles before pumping the lithium-rich water into the ion-exchange systems located in the shipping containers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite bipartisan government support, the prospect of opening a deep gash in an unspoiled stretch of Nevada landscape has drawn fierce opposition from conservationists and lawsuits from ranchers and Native American tribes who say the Thacker Pass project would destroy the underground freshwater reservoirs on which they depend.

In California’s Salton Sea, developers such as EnergySource Minerals are looking to build a geothermal power plant to power a DLE facility pulling lithium from the inland desert lake. And energy giants such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are racing to develop an area in southwestern Arkansas called the Smackover region, where researchers with the US Geological Survey have found as much as 19 million metric tons of untapped lithium in salty underground water. In between, both geographically and strategically, is Lilac: It’s looking to develop new technology like the California companies but sell its hardware to the energy giants in Arkansas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Great Salt Lake isn’t an obvious place to develop a lithium mine. The Salton Sea boasts lithium concentrations of just under 200 parts per million. Argentina, where Lilac has another test facility, has resources of above 700 parts per million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here on the Great Salt Lake? “It’s 70 parts per million,” Raef Sully, Lilac’s Australia-born chief executive, tells me. “So if you had a football stadium with 45,000 seats, this would be three people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Lilac, this is actually a feature of the location. “It’s a very, very good demonstration of the capability of our technology,” Sully says. Showing that Lilac’s hardware can extract lithium at high purity levels from a brine with low concentration, he says, proves its versatility. That wasn’t the reason Lilac selected the site, though. “Utah is a mining friendly state,” says Elizabeth Pond, the vice president of communications. And though the lake water has low concentrations of lithium, extracting the brine simply calls for running a hose into the water, whereas other locations would require digging a well at great cost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;When I accompanied Sully to the test site during my tour, our route following unpaved county roads lined with fields of wild sunflowers. The facility itself is little more than an assortment of converted shipping containers and two mobile trailers, one to serve as the main office and the other as a field laboratory to test samples. It’s off the grid, relying on diesel generators that the company says will be replaced with propane units once this location is converted to a permanent facility but could eventually be swapped for geothermal technology tapping into a hot rock resource located nearby. (Solar panels, Sully clarifies, couldn’t supply the 24-7 power supply the facility will need.) But it depends on its connection to the Great Salt Lake via that lengthy hose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="hand holding a square of wire mesh with a clump of crystals in the center" class="wp-image-1124763" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9054.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Hardened salt and impurities are encrusted on metal mesh that keeps larger materials out of Lilac’s water intake system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pumped uphill, the lake water passes through a series of filters to remove solids until it ends up in a vessel filled with the company’s specially designed ceramic beads, made from a patented material that attracts lithium ions from the water. Once saturated, the beads are put through an acid wash to remove the lithium. The remaining brine is then repeatedly tested and, once deemed safe to release back into the lake, pumped back down to the shore through an outgoing tube in the hose. The lithium solution, meanwhile, is stockpiled in tanks on site before shipping off to a processing plant to be turned into battery-grade lithium carbonate, which is a white powder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As a technology provider in the long term, if we’re going to have decades of lithium demand, they want to position their technology as something that can tap a bunch of markets,” McBride says. “To have a technology that can potentially economically recover different types of resources in different types of environments is an enticing proposition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This testing ground won’t stay this way for long. During my visit, Lilac’s crew was starting to pack up the location after completing its demonstration testing. The results the company shared exclusively with me suggest a smashing success, particularly for such low-grade brine with numerous impurities: Lilac’s equipment recovered 87% of the available lithium, on average, with a purity rate of 99.97%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to clear the area to make way for construction of Lilac’s first permanent commercial facility at the same site. To meet the stipulations of Utah state permits for the new plant, the company had to cease all operations at the demonstration project. If everything goes according to plan, Lilac’s first US facility will begin commercial production in the second half of 2027. The company has lined up about two-thirds of its funding for the project. That could make the plant the first new commercial source of lithium in the US to come online in years, and the first DLE facility ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it’s fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac’s technology would produce between three and five times that amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are some potential snags. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. (Lilac says it’s largely immune to the restrictions since it returns the water to the lake.) While the relatively low concentrations of lithium in the water make for a good test case, full-scale commercial production would likely prove far more economical in a place with more of the metal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sunflowers growing next to a dirt road" class="wp-image-1124766" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9316.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wild sunflowers line the unpaved county roads that cut through ranching land en route to Lilac Solutions’ remote demonstration site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Great Salt Lake is probably the worst possible place to be doing this, because there are real challenges around pulling water from the lake,” says Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a mining engineer who previously served as the deputy director of battery minerals at the Department of Energy. “But if it’s just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. Lilac wants instead to sell its technology to others. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. Sully tells me it’s being built under a separate limited-liability corporation to make a potential sale easier if it’s successful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an unusual play in the lithium industry. Once most companies see success with their technology, “they go crazy and think they can vertically integrate and at the same time be a miner and an energy producer,” Kwasi Ampofo, the head of minerals and metals at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren’t choosing that route.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If things work out the right way, Sully says, Lilac could become the vendor of choice to projects like the oil-backed sites in the Smackover and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BOX ELDER COUNTY, Utah – On a bright afternoon in August, the shore on the North Arm of the Great Salt Lake looks like something out of a science fiction film set in a scorching alien world. The desert sun is blinding as it reflects off the white salt that gathers and crunches underfoot like snow at the water’s edge. In a part of the lake too shallow for boats, bacteria have turned the water a Pepto-Bismol pink. The landscape all around is ringed with jagged red mountains and brown brush.

That could make the plant the first new commercial source of lithium in the US to come online in years, and the first DLE facility ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it’s fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac’s technology would produce between three and five times that amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are some potential snags. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. (Lilac says it’s largely immune to the restrictions since it returns the water to the lake.) While the relatively low concentrations of lithium in the water make for a good test case, full-scale commercial production would likely prove far more economical in a place with more of the metal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="sunflowers growing next to a dirt road" class="wp-image-1124766" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9316.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wild sunflowers line the unpaved county roads that cut through ranching land en route to Lilac Solutions’ remote demonstration site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Great Salt Lake is probably the worst possible place to be doing this, because there are real challenges around pulling water from the lake,” says Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a mining engineer who previously served as the deputy director of battery minerals at the Department of Energy. “But if it’s just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. Lilac wants instead to sell its technology to others. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. Sully tells me it’s being built under a separate limited-liability corporation to make a potential sale easier if it’s successful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an unusual play in the lithium industry. Once most companies see success with their technology, “they go crazy and think they can vertically integrate and at the same time be a miner and an energy producer,” Kwasi Ampofo, the head of minerals and metals at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren’t choosing that route.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If things work out the right way, Sully says, Lilac could become the vendor of choice to projects like the oil-backed sites in the Smackover and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/07/1125060/this-company-is-planning-a-lithium-empire-from-the-shores-of-the-great-salt-lake/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The three big unanswered questions about Sora (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/07/1124998/the-three-big-unanswered-questions-about-sora/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-171852.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long. The app allows you to create a “cameo” of yourself—a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice—and insert other peoples’ cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To some people who believed earnestly in OpenAI’s promise to build AI that benefits all of humanity, the app is a punchline. A former OpenAI researcher who left to build an AI-for-science startup referred to Sora as an “infinite AI tiktok slop machine.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped it from soaring to the top spot on Apple’s US App Store. After I downloaded the app, I quickly learned what types of videos are, at least currently, performing well: bodycam-style footage of police pulling over pets or various trademarked characters, including SpongeBob and Scooby Doo; deepfake memes of Martin Luther King Jr. talking about Xbox; and endless variations of Jesus Christ navigating our modern world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just as quickly, I had a bunch of questions about what’s coming next for Sora. Here’s what I’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can it last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is betting that a sizable number of people will want to spend time on an app in which you can suspend your concerns about whether what you’re looking at is fake and indulge in a stream of raw AI. One reviewer put it this way: “It’s comforting because you know that everything you’re scrolling through isn’t real, where other platforms you sometimes have to guess if it’s real or fake. Here, there is no guessing, it’s all AI, all the time."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This may sound like hell to some. But judging by Sora’s popularity, lots of people want it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So what’s drawing these people in? There are two explanations. One is that Sora is a flash-in-the-pan gimmick, with people lining up to gawk at what cutting-edge AI can create now (in my experience, this is interesting for about five minutes). The second, which OpenAI is betting on, is that we’re witnessing a genuine shift in what type of content can draw eyeballs, and that users will stay with Sora because it allows a level of fantastical creativity not possible in any other app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a few decisions down the pike that may shape how many people stick around: how OpenAI decides to implement ads, what limits it sets for copyrighted content (see below), and what algorithms it cooks up to decide who sees what.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can OpenAI afford it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not profitable, but that’s not particularly strange given how Silicon Valley operates. What is peculiar, though, is that the company is investing in a platform for generating video, which is the most energy-intensive (and therefore expensive) form of AI we have. The energy it takes dwarfs the amount required to create images or answer text questions via ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn’t news to OpenAI, which has joined a half-trillion-dollar project to build data centers and new power plants. But Sora—which currently allows you to generate AI videos, for free, without limits—raises the stakes: How much will it cost the company?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is making moves toward monetizing things (you can now buy products directly through ChatGPT, for example). On October 3, its CEO, Sam Altman, wrote in a blog post that “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation,” but he didn’t get into specifics. One can imagine personalized ads and more in-app purchases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it’s concerning to imagine the mountain of emissions might result if Sora becomes popular. Altman has accurately described the emissions burden of one query to ChatGPT as impossibly small. What he has not quantified is what that figure is for a 10-second video generated by Sora. It’s only a matter of time until AI and climate researchers start demanding it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many lawsuits are coming?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sora is awash in copyrighted and trademarked characters. It allows you to easily deepfake deceased celebrities. Its videos use copyrighted music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that OpenAI has sent letters to copyright holders notifying them that they’ll have to opt out of the Sora platform if they don’t want their material included, which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how these things usually work. The law on how AI companies should handle copyrighted material is far from settled, and it’d be reasonable to expect lawsuits challenging this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In last week’s blog post, Altman wrote that OpenAI is “hearing from a lot of rightsholders” who want more control over how their characters are used in Sora. He says that the company plans to give those parties more “granular control” over their characters. Still, “there may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But another issue is the ease with which you can use the cameos of real people. People can restrict who can use their cameo, but what limits will there be for what these cameos can be made to do in Sora videos?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is apparently already an issue OpenAI is being forced to respond to. The head of Sora, Bill Peebles, posted on October 5 that users can now restrict how their cameo can be used—preventing it from appearing in political videos or saying certain words, for example. How well will this work? Is it only a matter of time until someone’s cameo is used for something nefarious, explicit, illegal, or at least creepy, sparking a lawsuit alleging that OpenAI is responsible?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, we haven’t seen what full-scale Sora looks like yet (OpenAI is still doling out access to the app via invite codes). When we do, I think it will serve as a grim test: Can AI create videos so fine-tuned for endless engagement that they’ll outcompete “real” videos for our attention? In the end, Sora isn’t just testing OpenAI’s technology—it’s testing us, and how much of our reality we’re willing to trade for an infinite scroll of simulation.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-171852.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long.

IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob isn&amp;#x27;t another vibe coder, it&amp;#x27;s an enterprise modernization tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,&amp;quot;  Bruno Aziza, IBM&amp;#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to  more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&amp;#x27;s Llama and IBM&amp;#x27;s recently released&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Granite 4 models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Anthropic co-created &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the &amp;quot;prototype to production chasm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today, there&amp;#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,&amp;quot; Aziza said. &amp;quot;Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agent lifecycle framework&lt;/b&gt;: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrated AI governance&lt;/b&gt;: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enterprise infrastructure&lt;/b&gt;: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No-code and pro-code options&lt;/b&gt;: Langflow is &amp;quot;low-code.&amp;quot; IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-built domain agents&lt;/b&gt;: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Production observability&lt;/b&gt;: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the &amp;quot;brittle scripts&amp;quot; problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&amp;#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments.

Project Bob&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&amp;#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&amp;#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;For many enterprises, there continue to be barriers to fully adopting and benefiting from agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;IBM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;is betting the blocker isn&amp;#x27;t building AI agents but governing them in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its TechXchange 2025 conference today, IBM unveiled a series of capabilities designed to bridge the gap: Project Bob, an AI-first IDE that orchestrates multiple LLMs to automate application modernization; AgentOps for real-time agent governance; and the first integration of open-source&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/datastax-acquires-langflow-to-accelerate-enterprise-generative-ai-app-development"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Langflow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/agents-are-key-to-enterprise-ai-success-heres-ibms-plan-on-how-to-make-it-happen"&gt; &lt;u&gt;watsonx Orchestrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IBM&amp;#x27;s platform for deploying and managing AI agents. IBM&amp;#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob isn&amp;#x27;t another vibe coder, it&amp;#x27;s an enterprise modernization tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,&amp;quot;  Bruno Aziza, IBM&amp;#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to  more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&amp;#x27;s Llama and IBM&amp;#x27;s recently released&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Granite 4 models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Anthropic co-created &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the &amp;quot;prototype to production chasm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today, there&amp;#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,&amp;quot; Aziza said. &amp;quot;Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agent lifecycle framework&lt;/b&gt;: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrated AI governance&lt;/b&gt;: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement.

From curated videos on Instagram Reels to booking engines that build entire itineraries in seconds, AI is becoming a powerful force in how journeys are imagined, booked, and lived. But this shift raises an important question: is AI giving travellers more freedom, or quietly steering their choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit, believes AI can do both, speaking to &lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt;. In a wide-ranging conversation, he explained how AI is transforming travel discovery, personalisation, cultural exchange, and ethics—and why the industry must set clear guardrails as technology takes on a more active role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-as-a-travel-companion"&gt;AI as a travel companion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is changing how people discover destinations. Instead of generic travel lists, platforms now serve content that feels personal. “AI has turned travel discovery into a personal canvas,” Hamidaddin said. “Platforms like Instagram Reels no longer just show ‘where to go’; they curate journeys that feel tailor-made for each traveller.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109759" height="760" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif" width="785" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift is not just about convenience. By highlighting lesser-known destinations, AI can spread demand and ease pressure on crowded tourist spots. It can also introduce travellers to authentic local experiences that might otherwise remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin sees the next phase as “agentic AI”—technology that doesn’t just make suggestions but takes action. He described a future where AI automatically rebooks flights disrupted by weather, adjusts itineraries, and reschedules reservations in real time. “That’s frictionless travel—where the logistics fade and the adventure takes centre stage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-personalisation-vs-algorithmic-influence-in-travel"&gt;AI personalisation vs. algorithmic influence in travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven booking engines promise hyper-personalised recommendations, matching experiences to individual interests and budgets. This can make planning smoother and more inspiring, but it also comes with risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They do both,” Hamidaddin said when asked whether AI empowers travellers or guides them without their knowledge. “AI can empower travellers like never before—matching experiences to passions, budgets, and even moods. But unchecked, algorithms can quietly narrow horizons, nudging people toward predictable options. This risk only increases with agentic AI, which will make decisions on travellers’ behalf. That’s why transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. AI should be a compass, not a cage, and travellers must always hold the final word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trust-and-transparency"&gt;Trust and transparency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between personalisation and privacy will shape the next era of travel. As AI systems collect vast amounts of personal data, travellers are more aware of how their preferences, clicks, and searches are used. Hamidaddin stressed that trust is the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The era of hyper-personalisation must be built on trust. Travellers know their data is powerful, and they’re right to ask how it’s being used,” he said. The solution, in his view, is “radical transparency: explicit consent, clear explanations, and real opt-in choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI, which can act on a traveller’s behalf, makes this even more important. If algorithms are booking, adjusting, or cancelling plans automatically, travellers need clear ways to control and understand these actions. “True innovation doesn’t just customise the journey; it safeguards the traveller’s confidence and autonomy,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-standards-through-tourise"&gt;Setting standards through TOURISE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin will lead discussions on these topics at the inaugural TOURISE Summit in Riyadh this November. He sees the summit as a chance to shape global standards for AI use in travel, not just showcase technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The TOURISE is designed to be more than an event—it’s the world’s first platform where government, business, and technology leaders unite to shape travel tech responsibly,” he said. His goals include creating a shared ethical framework for AI, encouraging partnerships to address privacy and workforce challenges, promoting sustainability, and training the global tourism workforce to thrive in an AI-driven industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TOURISE must set a new benchmark: innovation with integrity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-exchange-and-economic-growth"&gt;Cultural exchange and economic growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI’s influence goes beyond logistics. It is also changing cultural exchange and economic development, particularly in Saudi Arabia. “AI is dissolving barriers—linguistic, cultural, and economic. It’s curating authentic connections that go beyond sightseeing into meaningful exchange,” Hamidaddin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how Saudi Arabia is using AI to highlight cultural and historical treasures like AlUla and Diriyah, while supporting artisans, festivals, and small businesses. Agentic AI will help create smoother travel experiences that allow visitors to focus more on culture and less on planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about more visitors; it’s about inclusive growth, mutual respect, and shared prosperity,” he said. By 2030, AI is expected to contribute $135 billion to Saudi Arabia’s GDP, with tourism playing a central role. But for Hamidaddin, the real impact is measured in “bonds between people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethical-guardrails-for-ai-in-travel"&gt;Ethical guardrails for AI in travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI systems take on more responsibility, clear ethical standards become essential. Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-with-ethics"&gt;Innovation with ethics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-for-travel"&gt;A new era for travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by S O C I A L .

Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-with-ethics"&gt;Innovation with ethics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-for-travel"&gt;A new era for travel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by S O C I A L .

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three big unanswered questions about Sora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Last week OpenAI released Sora, a TikTok-style app that presents an endless feed of exclusively AI-generated videos, each up to 10 seconds long. The app allows you to create a “cameo” of yourself—a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice—and insert other peoples’ cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the days since, it soared to the top spot on Apple’s US App Store. But its explosive growth raises a bunch of questions: can its popularity last? Can OpenAI afford it? And how soon until we start seeing lawsuits over its use of copyrighted content?

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong, who previously advised Musk during the Twitter deal, will oversee the finances of both xAI and X, which were merged in April, the report said. The former banker has been working with xAI for several weeks and was only recently appointed as CFO, the FT added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI has been without a CFO since its previous finance head, Mike Liberatore, left the company in July, and Armstrong’s appointment follows a slate of high-profile executive departures at both xAI and X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI’s general counsel, Robert Keele, left the company in August after a little more than a year on the job. Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer, also departed around the same time, and Igor Babuschkin, one of xAI’s co-founders, in August said he was leaving the company to launch his own VC firm dedicated to AI safety research. Linda Yaccarino, former CEO of X, also resigned in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong will take over from X’s current CFO, Mahmoud Reza Banki, who is leaving the company, the FT reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI’s general counsel, Robert Keele, left the company in August after a little more than a year on the job. Raghu Rao, a senior lawyer, also departed around the same time, and Igor Babuschkin, one of xAI’s co-founders, in August said he was leaving the company to launch his own VC firm dedicated to AI safety research. Linda Yaccarino, former CEO of X, also resigned in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armstrong will take over from X’s current CFO, Mahmoud Reza Banki, who is leaving the company, the FT reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/xai-hires-former-morgan-stanley-banker-anthony-armstrong-as-cfo/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:12:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] OpenAI and the race for AI-driven commerce (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/openai-and-the-race-for-ai-driven-commerce/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-07-at-9.35.14-AM.jpg?resize=1200,603" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI held its annual dev day on Monday, where the company rolled out its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. The demo was impressive, showing how programs like Spotify and Figma can be called or discovered without leaving the ChatGPT window. With so much of the tech world barreling toward AI integration, OpenAI’s demo was the best picture yet of what an AI-first internet might actually look like, with interfaces like ChatGPT querying information and executing commands directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you’re watching closely, you may have noticed that there’s a lot of room in this system for money to change hands. Just last week, the company launched Instant Checkout, an agentic shopping system that serves as payment infrastructure for one-off purchases, plugging in any stores that sell through Shopify, Etsy, or Stripe. Now, apps provide the front-end infrastructure, letting service providers build their own interface into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, OpenAI now has all the pieces in place for AI-driven commerce, establishing ChatGPT as a place customers go to buy and retailers go to sell. It’s a huge new line of business for the company — and one with huge implications for the tech industry. In this world, OpenAI isn’t just competing with Google and Anthropic, but with Amazon and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you look at OpenAI’s pending app partners in the launch announcement, you can see how far the vision reaches. ChatGPT will be able to call you a cab through Uber, book a trip on Expedia, call a plumber or locksmith through Thumbtack, and order groceries from Instacart, prepared food from DoorDash, or big-box goods from Target. Without too much more work, ChatGPT could become a portal for most of its users’ discretionary spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If it works, this would be worth a lot more than just a $20-a-month subscription. The precise terms of the arrangement are still unclear, but like any app store, OpenAI is well-positioned to get a portion of any money spent on its platform. ChatGPT is also recommending products, drawing on its wealth of data about its users, which tips the balance of power between OpenAI and retailers even more. In Ben Thompson’s terms, ChatGPT becomes a super-aggregator, funneling customers to retailers and providing an entry point for ever-larger amounts of commerce. OpenAI has lots of potential lines of business to pursue, but it’s no exaggeration to say that AI-driven commerce is one of the most lucrative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI isn’t the only company with an eye on this prospect. On the same day as the ChatGPT announcement, Adobe released a report predicting that this year’s holiday would be dominated by AI-assisted shopping, with shoppers turning to chatbots instead of search engines to find the best deals available. A separate report from Mastercard dubbed agentic commerce as a “new competitive arena” for finance. Google has already launched its own competing protocol for agentic commerce called AP2, which arrives with a broader scope but less momentum than OpenAI’s version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The simplest version of AI-driven shopping is using ChatGPT to find products in place of search: If you’re looking for a canvas tennis shoe under $80, ChatGPT can find it for you just as easily as Google Search. But AI systems don’t need to be passive. The AP2 specification includes a provision for agent-initiated purchases, if you want an agent to buy concert tickets as soon as they become available, say, or book a flight as soon as it falls below a certain price. Of course, there could be agents on the other side of the transaction too, negotiating with purchasing agents for the best deal, and willing to bundle goods under the right circumstances. If retailers and customers are willing to take the leap, the changes could extend pretty far beyond a simple “buy” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest unanswered question is whether the shopping public will actually be interested.

But then, they haven’t had a chance to; these systems aren’t even properly available now, and it will be months before the average user can try out a fully agentic shopping system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armonk, New York-based&amp;nbsp;IBM announced it will be adding&amp;nbsp;Anthropic’s&amp;nbsp;Claude large language model family into some of its software products on Tuesday. The first&amp;nbsp;product to tap Claude will be IBM’s integrated development environment, which&amp;nbsp;is already available to a select group of customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;IBM also announced&amp;nbsp;it created a guide in partnership with Anthropic on how enterprises can build, deploy, and&amp;nbsp;maintain&amp;nbsp;enterprise-grade&amp;nbsp;AI agents.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Terms of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the future of the partnership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has&amp;nbsp;been making&amp;nbsp;a big push into the enterprise sector since it released&amp;nbsp;Claude Enterprise&amp;nbsp;in September 2024.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced a deal to bring Claude to consulting giant Deloitte’s nearly 500,000-person global workforce on Monday. Anthropic said this would be the largest enterprise rollout for the company yet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A July study conducted by Menlo Ventures found that enterprises prefer Claude models over any other AI models, including OpenAI’s. The study found that usage of OpenAI’s models by enterprises has been declining since 2023.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, with more than a billion internet subscribers — has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firm Similarweb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054946" height="1374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg" width="1907" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In August, Reliance Industries partnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That Reliance–OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s Claude app, available on iOS and Android, recorded a 48% year-over-year increase in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs this year, according to Appfigures. Consumer spending on the app in India surged 572% year-over-year, generating $195,000 in September alone, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054947" height="5632" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png" width="8140" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The India figures, however, remain modest compared with those in the United States, where downloads rose 91% year-over-year and consumer spending jumped 604%. U.S. users spent $2.5 million on the Claude app in September, per Appfigures. Globally, the app saw 74% growth in downloads to 1.01 million and a 546% rise in consumer spending to $5.62 million in the same month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike OpenAI, which aims to establish a sales and marketing setup while overseeing policy updates from New Delhi, Anthropic plans to target developers and startups with its office in Bengaluru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3054950" height="5720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-downloads.png" width="8140" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is seeing its largest usage coming from India, a founder who works closely with the AI company told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Anthropic and OpenAI, Perplexity is also looking to tap India’s market. The company has partnered with Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel to offer its Perplexity Pro subscription to over 360 million Airtel customers for 12 months. The AI search startup has also refined its product for local users, including by launching live earnings call transcripts for Indian stocks to attract more engagement from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s Claude app, available on iOS and Android, recorded a 48% year-over-year increase in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs this year, according to Appfigures. Consumer spending on the app in India surged 572% year-over-year, generating $195,000 in September alone, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The India figures, however, remain modest compared with those in the United States, where downloads rose 91% year-over-year and consumer spending jumped 604%. U.S. users spent $2.5 million on the Claude app in September, per Appfigures. Globally, the app saw 74% growth in downloads to 1.01 million and a 546% rise in consumer spending to $5.62 million in the same month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike OpenAI, which aims to establish a sales and marketing setup while overseeing policy updates from New Delhi, Anthropic plans to target developers and startups with its office in Bengaluru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is seeing its largest usage coming from India, a founder who works closely with the AI company told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Anthropic and OpenAI, Perplexity is also looking to tap India’s market. The company has partnered with Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel to offer its Perplexity Pro subscription to over 360 million Airtel customers for 12 months. The AI search startup has also refined its product for local users, including by launching live earnings call transcripts for Indian stocks to attract more engagement from India.&lt;/p&gt;

But now their toys can talk back, thanks to a wave of companies that are fitting children’s playthings with chatbots and voice assistants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a trend that has particularly taken off in China: A recent report by the Shenzhen Toy Industry Association and JD.com predicts that the sector will surpass ¥100 billion ($14 billion) by 2030, growing faster than almost any other branch of consumer AI. According to the Chinese corporation registration database Qichamao, there are over 1,500 AI toy companies operating in China as of October 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the latest entrants to the market is a toy called BubblePal, a device the size of a Ping-Pong ball that clips onto a child’s favorite stuffed animal and makes it “talk.” The gadget comes with a smartphone app that lets parents switch between 39 characters, from Disney’s Elsa to the Chinese cartoon classic Nezha. It costs $149, and 200,000 units have been sold since it launched last summer. It’s made by the Chinese company Haivivi and runs on DeepSeek’s large language models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other companies are approaching the market differently. FoloToy, another Chinese startup, allows parents to customize a bear, bunny, or cactus toy by training it to speak with their own voice and speech pattern. FoloToy reported selling more than 20,000 of its AI-equipped plush toys in the first quarter of 2025, nearly equaling its total sales for 2024, and it projects sales of 300,000 units this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

BubblePal was launched in the US in December 2024 and is now also available in Canada and the UK. And FoloToy is now sold in more than 10 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Thailand. Rui Ma, a China tech analyst at AlphaWatch.AI, says that AI devices for children make particular sense in China, where there is already a well-established market for kid-focused educational electronics—a market that does not exist to the same extent globally. FoloToy’s CEO, Kong Miaomiao, told the Chinese outlet Baijing Chuhai that outside China, his firm is still just “reaching early adopters who are curious about AI.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China’s AI toy boom builds on decades of consumer electronics designed specifically for children. As early as the 1990s, companies such as BBK popularized devices like electronic dictionaries and “study machines,” marketed to parents as educational aids. These toy-electronics hybrids read aloud, tell interactive stories, and simulate the role of a playmate.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The competition is heating up, however—US companies have also started to develop and sell AI toys. The musician Grimes helped to create Grok, a plush toy that chats with kids and adapts to their personality. Toy giant Mattel is working with OpenAI to bring conversational AI to brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, with the first products expected to be announced later this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, reviews from parents who’ve bought AI toys in China are mixed. Although many appreciate the fact they are screen-free and come with strict parental controls, some parents say their AI capabilities can be glitchy, leading children to tire of them easily.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Penny Huang, based in Beijing, bought a BubblePal for her five-year-old daughter, who is cared for mostly by grandparents. Huang hoped that the toy could make her less lonely and reduce her constant requests to play with adults’ smartphones. But the novelty wore off quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The responses are too long and wordy. My daughter quickly loses patience,” says Huang, “It [the role-play] doesn’t feel immersive—just a voice that sometimes sounds out of place.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another parent who uses BubblePal, Hongyi Li, found the voice recognition lagging: “Children’s speech is fragmented and unclear. The toy frequently interrupts my kid or misunderstands what she says. It also still requires pressing a button to interact, which can be hard for toddlers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Huang recently listed her BubblePal for sale on Xianyu, a secondhand marketplace. “This is just like one of the many toys that my daughter plays for five minutes then gets tired of,” she says. “She wants to play with my phone more than anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-06-161500.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kids have always played with and talked to stuffed animals.

          &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI launched the Sora 2 video generator last week, the company wrote that it was taking measures to "block depictions of public figures" by default. But creators and viewers of Sora 2 videos are finding that prohibition has a rather large loophole, allowing for videos of public figures that happen to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X. Bruce Lee running a "dragon energy" DJ set. Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy. Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp. Mister Rogers doing a cameo on &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt;. Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers. Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people. Still, seeing these deceased celebrities used as props by an AI tool can obviously be upsetting to their living relatives and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Please stop sending me AI videos of dad," Zelda Williams said in a since-deleted Instagram story Monday (archived here), referring to her late father Robin Williams. "Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't... It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it's NOT what he'd want."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sorasynth/video/7557981958135991583" class="tiktok-embed"&gt;
&lt;section&gt;@sorasynth Martin Luther King forgot his lines mid-speech🎤🤔🤔 #mlk #speech #fyu #sora #ai ♬ original sound - SoraVerseAl&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to what the late Williams would have wanted is important here. OpenAI notes that living users, including public figures, can opt in to Sora 2's "cameos" feature by scanning their own face with a smartphone to "drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity." OpenAI promises that cameo users "are in control of your likeness end-to-end" and that the feature is designed "to ensure that your audio and image likeness are used with your consent." Cameo users can also revoke access to their scanned images at any time and have moderation control over other videos created with that scan.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But deceased public figures obviously can't consent to Sora 2's cameo feature or exercise that kind of "end-to-end" control of their own likeness. And OpenAI seems OK with that. "We don’t have a comment to add, but we do allow the generation of historical figures," an OpenAI spokesperson recently told PCMag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The countdown to lawsuits begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of digital re-creations of dead celebrities isn't exactly a new issue—back in the '90s, we were collectively wrestling with John Lennon chatting to Forrest Gump and Fred Astaire dancing with a Dirt Devil vacuum. Back then, though, that kind of footage required painstaking digital editing and technology only easily accessible to major video production houses. Now, more convincing footage of deceased public figures can be generated by any Sora 2 user in minutes for just a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, the right of publicity for deceased public figures is governed by various laws in at least 24 states. California's statute, which dates back to 1985, bars unauthorized post-mortem use of a public figure's likeness "for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of products, merchandise, goods, or services." But a 2001 California Supreme Court ruling explicitly allows those likenesses to be used for "transformative" purposes under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York version of the law, signed in 2022, contains specific language barring the unauthorized use of a "digital replicas" that are "so realistic that a reasonable observer would believe it is a performance by the individual being portrayed and no other individual" and in a manner "likely to deceive the public into thinking it was authorized by the person or persons." But video makers can get around this prohibition with a "conspicuous disclaimer" explicitly noting that the use is unauthorized.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control over AI re-creations of performers was a major focus of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, resulting in a contract that gave members full control over the use of digital replicas in future unionized projects. Zelda Williams wrote publicly during that strike about the "disturbing" efforts to re-create her father's voice at the time. "These recreations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Altman also promised "many more [changes] to come" and to "expect a very high rate of change from us... we will make some good decisions and some missteps, but we will take feedback and try to fix the missteps very quickly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a pair of podcasters were sued after creating an "AI" version of a George Carlin comedy routine that used a re-creation of Carlin's voice (but which was actually written by a human).

          &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI launched the Sora 2 video generator last week, the company wrote that it was taking measures to "block depictions of public figures" by default. But creators and viewers of Sora 2 videos are finding that prohibition has a rather large loophole, allowing for videos of public figures that happen to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X. Bruce Lee running a "dragon energy" DJ set. Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy. Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp. Mister Rogers doing a cameo on &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt;. Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers. Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people. Still, seeing these deceased celebrities used as props by an AI tool can obviously be upsetting to their living relatives and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Please stop sending me AI videos of dad," Zelda Williams said in a since-deleted Instagram story Monday (archived here), referring to her late father Robin Williams. "Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't... It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it's NOT what he'd want."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section&gt;@sorasynth Martin Luther King forgot his lines mid-speech🎤🤔🤔 #mlk #speech #fyu #sora #ai ♬ original sound - SoraVerseAl&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to what the late Williams would have wanted is important here. OpenAI notes that living users, including public figures, can opt in to Sora 2's "cameos" feature by scanning their own face with a smartphone to "drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity." OpenAI promises that cameo users "are in control of your likeness end-to-end" and that the feature is designed "to ensure that your audio and image likeness are used with your consent." Cameo users can also revoke access to their scanned images at any time and have moderation control over other videos created with that scan.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But deceased public figures obviously can't consent to Sora 2's cameo feature or exercise that kind of "end-to-end" control of their own likeness. And OpenAI seems OK with that. "We don’t have a comment to add, but we do allow the generation of historical figures," an OpenAI spokesperson recently told PCMag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The countdown to lawsuits begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of digital re-creations of dead celebrities isn't exactly a new issue—back in the '90s, we were collectively wrestling with John Lennon chatting to Forrest Gump and Fred Astaire dancing with a Dirt Devil vacuum. Back then, though, that kind of footage required painstaking digital editing and technology only easily accessible to major video production houses. Now, more convincing footage of deceased public figures can be generated by any Sora 2 user in minutes for just a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, the right of publicity for deceased public figures is governed by various laws in at least 24 states. California's statute, which dates back to 1985, bars unauthorized post-mortem use of a public figure's likeness "for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of products, merchandise, goods, or services." But a 2001 California Supreme Court ruling explicitly allows those likenesses to be used for "transformative" purposes under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York version of the law, signed in 2022, contains specific language barring the unauthorized use of a "digital replicas" that are "so realistic that a reasonable observer would believe it is a performance by the individual being portrayed and no other individual" and in a manner "likely to deceive the public into thinking it was authorized by the person or persons." But video makers can get around this prohibition with a "conspicuous disclaimer" explicitly noting that the use is unauthorized.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
