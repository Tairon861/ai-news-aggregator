While international competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic have built their businesses around subscription models, Alibaba’s free-access approach challenges this framework by integrating AI capabilities directly into existing consumer and enterprise ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;, the Qwen app serves as “a comprehensive AI tool designed to meet user needs in both professional and personal contexts,” rather than being portrayed as a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play since mid-November, the application integrates with Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms, mapping services, and local business tools – demonstrating what industry analysts term “agentic AI” capabilities that can execute cross-scenario tasks in addition to generating content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise adoption drives momentum&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical foundation underpinning the Qwen AI app’s consumer success has been building since 2023, when Alibaba fully open-sourced its Qwen model. Its decision has resulted in cumulative global downloads exceeding 600 million, establishing Qwen as one of the world’s most widely adopted open-source large language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises evaluating AI deployment strategies, this adoption pattern offers instructive insights. The recently released Qwen3-Max model now ranks among the top three globally in performance benchmarks, with notable traction in Silicon Valley. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has stated publicly that his company “heavily relies on Qwen”, while NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged Qwen’s growing dominance in the global open-source model space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise endorsements signal practical business value rather than speculative potential. Companies implementing AI solutions face persistent challenges around cost management, integration complexity, and demonstrable return on investment. Alibaba’s strategy addresses these issues, offering models without licensing fees and providing integration pathways through its broader ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Competitive implications for business leaders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su Lian Jye, chief analyst at consultancy Omdia, told &lt;em&gt;SCMP&lt;/em&gt; that increased user adoption generates valuable feedback loops: “More users mean more feedback, which would allow Alibaba to further fine-tune its models.” The observation highlights a competitive advantage for cloud service providers with substantial capital reserves and existing user data infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of Qwen’s launch carries strategic significance. Chinese AI startups Moonshot AI and Zhipu AI introduced subscription fees recently for their Kimi and ChatGLM services respectively, creating an opening for Alibaba’s free-access positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su noted AI startups might struggle to compete with this approach, which “will only work for cloud service providers that have large capital reserves and can monetise user data.” For enterprise decision-makers, the competitive dynamic presents opportunities and considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free-access models reduce initial deployment costs but raise questions about long-term sustainability, data privacy frameworks, and vendor lock-in risks. Organisations adopting AI tools must evaluate whether immediate cost savings align with their governance requirements and strategic independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Navigating geopolitical complexity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qwen app’s success unfolds against a backdrop of intensifying US-China technology competition. Some US observers have expressed concerns about Alibaba’s advancement rate and investment scale. Marketing specialist Tulsi Soni remarked on social media that “we’re witnessing a full-blown Qwen panic” in Silicon Valley – a comment reflecting anxiety about competitive positioning rather than technical assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has also faced scrutiny, including unsubstantiated allegations from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;regarding Chinese military applications, which the company rejects. For multinational enterprises operating in these geopolitical boundaries, such tensions complicate AI procurement decisions and require careful risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What this means for enterprise AI strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qwen AI app’s trajectory offers several practical takeaways for business leaders navigating AI adoption. First, open-source models have matured to competitive parity with proprietary alternatives in many cases, potentially reducing dependency on subscription-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, ecosystem integration – connecting AI capabilities with existing business tools – delivers more immediate value than standalone chatbot functionality. Third, the bifurcation between free-access and subscription models will likely intensify, requiring organisations to evaluate the total cost of ownership beyond licensing fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alibaba positions Qwen for evolution into what industry observers describe as “a national-level application,” enterprises worldwide face strategic choices about AI infrastructure. The question is no longer whether to adopt AI tools, but which deployment models align with specific business requirements, risk tolerances, and competitive positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coming months will reveal whether Alibaba can monetise its massive user base successfully and maintain the technical performance that attracted enterprise adopters. For now, the Qwen AI app’s early success demonstrates that alternative business models can compete effectively against established subscription frameworks – a development that should inform enterprise planning in industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Alibaba rolls out revamped Qwen chatbot as model pricing drops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The share of US teens turning to the same tool for schoolwork doubled between 2023 and 2024. Generative AI tools overall are a fixture of life for seven out of ten teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of ChatGPT and its competitors was supposed to put even the best essay writing services out of business. After all, generative AI can create an essay in seconds. So, why pay a professional to take care of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, three years after the launch of ChatGPT, academic help services are still going strong. Here’s why US students continue to choose expert help over AI-generated content, and the four services they trust with their assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-students-actually-use-ai-tools"&gt;How students actually use AI tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it first made the news, ChatGPT was called “the death of the English essay.” Now, that kind of language seems like a promise of an apocalypse that (predictably, in hindsight) never came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, students don’t use generative AI tools to generate whole essays. Across multiple surveys, brainstorming, outlining, research, and test prep emerge as the main use cases for AI. For example, the survey from University of California Irvine found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;66% use AI to learn more on a specific topic/subject&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;56% use it to prepare for tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% use it to find academic sources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;46% use it for note-taking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a third of respondents (31%) reported turning to AI tools to write essays. The percentage went even lower for scholarship and college application essays (21%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-students-still-opt-for-top-essay-writing-services"&gt;Why students still opt for top essay writing services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI tools are great at generating long texts in a blink of an eye for free, that’s where their benefits typically end. Unlike professional writers, AI simply can’t:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grasp all the intricacies and subtleties of the expectations toward an essay, especially if it’s meant for a college or scholarship application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture the customer’s authentic voice based on samples of their previous writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write an essay that’s truly distinct and memorable: AI tools regurgitate cliché narratives and generic statements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come up with qualitatively new ideas and arguments: AI can only repeat the opinions already out there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verify the essay is 100% factually correct: AI tools can hallucinate facts, and many don’t even include precise sources of information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential AI checks are another concern that pushes some students to hire a top essay writing service instead of using AI. For one, Turnitin automatically checks all assignments for both plagiarism and AI content now. Some educators take it on themselves to run AI content scans, too. An essay written by a professional will pass those checks without a hitch, which can’t be said about an AI-generated one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-best-online-essay-writing-services-students-trust"&gt;4 best online essay writing services students trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which platforms score the highest among the best online essay writing services trusted by US students? Here’s your snapshot of four such platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating (Sitejabber)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;EssayPro&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;One-stop help&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.4/5 based on 31,122 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;WritePaper&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;In-depth research&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.0/5 based on 1,019 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MyPaperHelp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Personalised writing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.8/5 based on 364 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PaperWriter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Collaborative approach&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.9/5 based on 848 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-essaypro-best-for-one-stop-help"&gt;EssayPro: Best for one-stop help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110841" height="661" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-13-1024x661.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;EssayPro is the essay writing service online with the most extensive track record on this list. As of writing, it has over 30,000 reviews on Sitejabber alone and completes 300,000+ assignments annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what makes it the best essay writing service. Based on customer reviews, students prefer EssayPro to AI because its essay help remains affordable, all while being more in-depth, insightful, and creative than AI content. The fact that its writers specialise in 140+ subjects and 50+ paper types helped EssayPro secure its popularity, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;350+ writers specialising in 140+ subjects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good price-quality ratio with transparent pricing and no surprise fees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid track record of on-time delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free plagiarism and AI reports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full control over who works on your essay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all orders can be completed in 3 hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No over-the-phone customer support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-writepaper-best-for-in-depth-research"&gt;WritePaper: Best for in-depth research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110842" height="540" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-14-1024x540.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools can’t do the kind of research, analysis, and synthesis that experts at WritePaper do every day. That’s what makes it the best college essay writing service for essays and other papers that have to be insightful and present advanced, nuanced arguments on a complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the best essay writing service reviews, WritePaper’s experts are especially good at delivering in-depth essays in research-intensive disciplines that require advanced reasoning. Those include nursing, philosophy, psychology, and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid argumentation and research skills among writers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;115+ subjects covered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around-the-clock support and help&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly researched essays with advanced reasoning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diverse formatting options (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially overwhelming writer selection process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graphs and tables cost extra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mypaperhelp-best-for-personalised-writing"&gt;MyPaperHelp: Best for personalised writing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110843" height="648" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-15-1024x648.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all services on this list provide custom writing services, MyPaperHelp is a paper writing service frequently praised for its personalised approach to orders. Its experts readily work with samples and adapt the style and tone of voice to the essay’s context and purpose. They also build on the ideas, suggestions, and whole outlines added to the order form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes MyPaperHelp the best essay writing website for any essay that has to be highly personal in nature. Think scholarship and college application essays or creative writing assignments that focus on personal experiences rather than academic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wide range of writing styles and tones of voice supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Essays fully adapted to their context and purpose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality creative writing assignments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possible to attach samples to the order form that writers build on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique, authentic writing that doesn’t rehash generic ideas or clichés&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have to be very precise with your instructions to leave no room for misunderstandings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Originality reports aren’t provided by default; you have to request one (although they are free)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paperwriter-best-for-collaborative-approach"&gt;PaperWriter: Best for collaborative approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110844" height="559" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-16-1024x559.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, US students turn to PaperWriter for many reasons, but direct writer communication is the most frequently cited one. So, if two-way communication with the writer is important, PaperWriter is definitely worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PaperWriter’s experts routinely reach out to customers via direct chat whenever they need to clarify the requirements or ask for additional information. That makes PaperWriter the best essay writing service for students who want their essays to reflect their thoughts, ideas, and opinions to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct writer chat with end-to-end encryption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strict privacy policy that protects confidentiality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Responsive writers who proactively communicate with customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited free revisions without mandatory waiting time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review work services available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writer selection may be a bit time-consuming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A collaborative approach is, by definition, also somewhat time-consuming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-ai-can-t-rival-human-creativity-amp-expertise"&gt;Final thoughts: AI can’t rival human creativity &amp;amp; expertise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools may be becoming more ingrained in the learning process, but that doesn’t mean they’re ready to replace human creativity and expertise altogether. Yes, they can help you outline an essay or brainstorm ideas. But only professionals can come up with truly fresh ideas or develop a complex argument on a topic that requires hours of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it’s safe to say that essay writing services aren’t going anywhere any time soon. They will continue supporting students in their studies, more so than AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the best essay writing service, Reddit and other social media platforms are a good place to start. Independent review platforms like Sitejabber and Reviews.io can also come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the headlines: a third of US college students say they use ChatGPT for writing tasks at least once a month.

Here’s why US students continue to choose expert help over AI-generated content, and the four services they trust with their assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-students-actually-use-ai-tools"&gt;How students actually use AI tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it first made the news, ChatGPT was called “the death of the English essay.” Now, that kind of language seems like a promise of an apocalypse that (predictably, in hindsight) never came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, students don’t use generative AI tools to generate whole essays. Across multiple surveys, brainstorming, outlining, research, and test prep emerge as the main use cases for AI. For example, the survey from University of California Irvine found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;66% use AI to learn more on a specific topic/subject&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;56% use it to prepare for tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% use it to find academic sources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;46% use it for note-taking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a third of respondents (31%) reported turning to AI tools to write essays. The percentage went even lower for scholarship and college application essays (21%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-students-still-opt-for-top-essay-writing-services"&gt;Why students still opt for top essay writing services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI tools are great at generating long texts in a blink of an eye for free, that’s where their benefits typically end. Unlike professional writers, AI simply can’t:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grasp all the intricacies and subtleties of the expectations toward an essay, especially if it’s meant for a college or scholarship application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture the customer’s authentic voice based on samples of their previous writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write an essay that’s truly distinct and memorable: AI tools regurgitate cliché narratives and generic statements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come up with qualitatively new ideas and arguments: AI can only repeat the opinions already out there&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verify the essay is 100% factually correct: AI tools can hallucinate facts, and many don’t even include precise sources of information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential AI checks are another concern that pushes some students to hire a top essay writing service instead of using AI. For one, Turnitin automatically checks all assignments for both plagiarism and AI content now. Some educators take it on themselves to run AI content scans, too. An essay written by a professional will pass those checks without a hitch, which can’t be said about an AI-generated one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-best-online-essay-writing-services-students-trust"&gt;4 best online essay writing services students trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which platforms score the highest among the best online essay writing services trusted by US students? Here’s your snapshot of four such platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating (Sitejabber)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;EssayPro&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;One-stop help&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.4/5 based on 31,122 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;WritePaper&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;In-depth research&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.0/5 based on 1,019 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MyPaperHelp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Personalised writing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.8/5 based on 364 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PaperWriter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Collaborative approach&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.9/5 based on 848 reviews&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-essaypro-best-for-one-stop-help"&gt;EssayPro: Best for one-stop help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110841" height="661" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-13-1024x661.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;EssayPro is the essay writing service online with the most extensive track record on this list. As of writing, it has over 30,000 reviews on Sitejabber alone and completes 300,000+ assignments annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what makes it the best essay writing service. Based on customer reviews, students prefer EssayPro to AI because its essay help remains affordable, all while being more in-depth, insightful, and creative than AI content. The fact that its writers specialise in 140+ subjects and 50+ paper types helped EssayPro secure its popularity, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;350+ writers specialising in 140+ subjects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good price-quality ratio with transparent pricing and no surprise fees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid track record of on-time delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free plagiarism and AI reports&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full control over who works on your essay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all orders can be completed in 3 hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No over-the-phone customer support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-writepaper-best-for-in-depth-research"&gt;WritePaper: Best for in-depth research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110842" height="540" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-14-1024x540.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools can’t do the kind of research, analysis, and synthesis that experts at WritePaper do every day. That’s what makes it the best college essay writing service for essays and other papers that have to be insightful and present advanced, nuanced arguments on a complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the best essay writing service reviews, WritePaper’s experts are especially good at delivering in-depth essays in research-intensive disciplines that require advanced reasoning. Those include nursing, philosophy, psychology, and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid argumentation and research skills among writers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;115+ subjects covered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around-the-clock support and help&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly researched essays with advanced reasoning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diverse formatting options (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially overwhelming writer selection process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graphs and tables cost extra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mypaperhelp-best-for-personalised-writing"&gt;MyPaperHelp: Best for personalised writing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110843" height="648" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-15-1024x648.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all services on this list provide custom writing services, MyPaperHelp is a paper writing service frequently praised for its personalised approach to orders. Its experts readily work with samples and adapt the style and tone of voice to the essay’s context and purpose. They also build on the ideas, suggestions, and whole outlines added to the order form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes MyPaperHelp the best essay writing website for any essay that has to be highly personal in nature. Think scholarship and college application essays or creative writing assignments that focus on personal experiences rather than academic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wide range of writing styles and tones of voice supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Essays fully adapted to their context and purpose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality creative writing assignments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possible to attach samples to the order form that writers build on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique, authentic writing that doesn’t rehash generic ideas or clichés&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have to be very precise with your instructions to leave no room for misunderstandings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Originality reports aren’t provided by default; you have to request one (although they are free)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paperwriter-best-for-collaborative-approach"&gt;PaperWriter: Best for collaborative approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110844" height="559" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-16-1024x559.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, US students turn to PaperWriter for many reasons, but direct writer communication is the most frequently cited one. So, if two-way communication with the writer is important, PaperWriter is definitely worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PaperWriter’s experts routinely reach out to customers via direct chat whenever they need to clarify the requirements or ask for additional information. That makes PaperWriter the best essay writing service for students who want their essays to reflect their thoughts, ideas, and opinions to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom writing: Starts at $10.80/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editing: Starts at $7.56/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proofreading: Starts at $5.40/page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct writer chat with end-to-end encryption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strict privacy policy that protects confidentiality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Responsive writers who proactively communicate with customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited free revisions without mandatory waiting time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review work services available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writer selection may be a bit time-consuming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A collaborative approach is, by definition, also somewhat time-consuming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-ai-can-t-rival-human-creativity-amp-expertise"&gt;Final thoughts: AI can’t rival human creativity &amp;amp; expertise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools may be becoming more ingrained in the learning process, but that doesn’t mean they’re ready to replace human creativity and expertise altogether. Yes, they can help you outline an essay or brainstorm ideas. But only professionals can come up with truly fresh ideas or develop a complex argument on a topic that requires hours of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it’s safe to say that essay writing services aren’t going anywhere any time soon. They will continue supporting students in their studies, more so than AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the best essay writing service, Reddit and other social media platforms are a good place to start. Independent review platforms like Sitejabber and Reviews.io can also come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/4-best-essay-writing-websites-students-choose-over-ai/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:34:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] “Go generate a bridge and jump off it”: How video pros are navigating AI (AI – Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/11/go-generate-a-bridge-and-jump-off-it-how-video-pros-are-navigating-ai/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the legendary Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki was shown a bizarre AI-generated video of a misshapen human body crawling across a floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyazaki&amp;nbsp;declared himself&amp;nbsp;“utterly disgusted” by the technology demo, which he considered an “insult to life itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it,” Miyazaki said. “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fans interpreted Miyazaki’s remarks as rejecting AI-generated video in general. So they didn’t like it when, in October 2024, filmmaker&amp;nbsp;PJ Accetturo&amp;nbsp;used AI tools to create a&amp;nbsp;fake trailer for a live-action version of Miyazaki’s animated classic &lt;em&gt;Princess&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mononoke&lt;/em&gt;. The trailer earned him 22 million views on X. It also earned him hundreds of insults and death threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go generate a bridge and jump off of it,” said one of the funnier retorts. Another urged&amp;nbsp;Accetturo to “throw your computer in a river and beg God’s forgiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone&amp;nbsp;tweeted that Miyazaki “should be allowed to legally hunt and kill this man for sport.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of AI image and video generation models has been controversial, to say the least. Artists have accused AI companies of stealing their work to build tools that put people out of a job. Using AI tools openly is stigmatized in many circles, as Accetturo learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as these models have improved, they have sped up workflows and afforded new opportunities for artistic expression. Artists without AI expertise might soon find themselves losing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken to nine actors, directors, and creators about how they are navigating these tricky waters. Here’s what they told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;The backlash to AI video generation, explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actors have emerged as a powerful force against AI. In 2023,&amp;nbsp;SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors’ union, had its longest-ever strike, partly to&amp;nbsp;establish more protections&amp;nbsp;for actors against AI replicas.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Actors have lobbied to regulate AI in their industry and beyond. One actor I talked with,&amp;nbsp;Erik Passoja, has testified before the California Legislature in favor of several bills, including for greater protections against pornographic deepfakes. SAG-AFTRA endorsed SB 1047, an AI safety bill regulating frontier models. The union also&amp;nbsp;organized&amp;nbsp;against the proposed moratorium on state AI bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent flashpoint came in September, when&amp;nbsp;Deadline Hollywood&amp;nbsp;reported that talent agencies were interested in signing “AI actress” Tilly Norwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actors weren’t happy. Emily Blunt told&amp;nbsp;Variety, “This is really, really scary. Come on agencies, don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natasha Lyonne, star of &lt;em&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/em&gt;, posted on an Instagram Story: “Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds. Deeply misguided &amp;amp; totally disturbed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash was partly specific to Tilly Norwood—Lyonne is no AI skeptic, having cofounded an AI studio—but it also reflects a set of concerns around AI common to many in Hollywood and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how SAG-AFTRA&amp;nbsp;explained its position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilly Norwood is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any “problem” — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement reflects three broad criticisms that come up over and over in discussions of AI art:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Most leading AI video models have been trained on broad swathes of the Internet, including images and films made by artists. In many cases, companies have not asked artists for permission to use this content, nor compensated them. Courts are still working out&amp;nbsp;whether this is fair use under copyright law. But many people I talked to consider AI companies’ training efforts to be theft of artists’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job loss:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If AI tools can make passable video quickly or drastically speed up editing tasks, that potentially takes jobs away from actors or film editors. While past technological advancements have also eliminated jobs—the adoption of digital cameras drastically reduced the number of people cutting physical film—AI could have an even broader impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistic quality:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;A lot of people told me they just didn’t think AI-generated content could ever be good art. Tess Dinerstein stars in vertical dramas—episodic programs optimized for viewing on smartphones. She told me that AI is “missing that sort of human connection that you have when you go to a movie theater and you’re sobbing your eyes out because your favorite actor is talking about their dead mom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern about theft is potentially solvable by changing how models are trained. Around the time Accetturo released the “Princess Mononoke” trailer, he&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;for generative AI tools to be “ethically trained on licensed datasets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have moved in this direction. For instance, independent filmmaker Gille Klabin told me he “feels pretty good” using Adobe products because the company trains its AI models on stock images that it pays royalties for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other two issues—job losses and artistic integrity—will be harder to finesse. Many creators—and fans—believe that AI-generated content misses the fundamental point of art, which is about creating an emotional connection between creators and viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while that point is compelling in theory, the details can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinerstein, the vertical drama actress, told me that she’s “not fundamentally against AI”—she admits “it provides a lot of resources to filmmakers” in specialized editing tasks—but she takes a hard stance against it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to ever explain gray areas on social media,” she said, and she doesn’t want to “come off as hypocritical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though she doesn’t think that AI poses a risk to her job—“people want to see what I’m up to”—she does fear people (both fans and vertical drama studios) making an AI representation of her without her permission. And she has found it easiest to just say, “You know what? Don’t involve me in AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others see it as a much broader issue. Actress&amp;nbsp;Susan Spano&amp;nbsp;told me it was “an issue for humans, not just actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a world of humans and animals,” she said. “Interaction with humans is what makes it fun. I mean, do we want a world of robots?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;How one director leaned into AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s relatively easy for actors to take a firm stance against AI because they inherently do their work in the physical world. But things are more complicated for other Hollywood creatives, such as directors, writers, and film editors. AI tools can genuinely make them more productive, and they’re at risk of losing work if they don’t stay on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the non-actors I talked to took a range of approaches to AI. Some still reject it. Others have used the tools reluctantly and tried to keep their heads down. Still others have openly embraced the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      Kavan Cardoza is a director and AI filmmaker.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take&amp;nbsp;Kavan Cardoza, for example. He worked as a music video director and photographer for close to a decade before getting his break into filmmaking with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the image model Midjourney was first released in 2022, Cardoza started playing around with image generation and later video generation. Eventually, he “started making a bunch of fake movie trailers” for existing movies and franchises. In December 2024, he made a fan film in the Batman universe that “exploded on the Internet,” before Warner Bros. took it down for copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza acknowledges that he re-created actors in former Batman movies “without their permission.” But he insists he wasn’t “trying to be malicious or whatever. It was truly just a fan film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Accetturo received death threats, the response to Cardoza’s fan film was quite positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every other major studio started contacting me,” Cardoza said. He set up an AI studio, Phantom X, with several of his close friends. Phantom X started by making ads (where AI video is&amp;nbsp;catching on quickest), but Cardoza wanted to focus back on films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Cardoza made a short film called &lt;em&gt;Echo Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, a blend of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;. Some shots look clearly AI-generated, but Cardoza used motion-capture technology from Runway to put the faces of real actors into his AI-generated world. Overall, the piece pretty much hangs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza wanted to work with real actors because their artistic choices can help elevate the script he’s written: “There’s a lot more levels of creativity to it.” But he needed SAG-AFTRA’s approval to make a film that blends AI techniques with the likenesses of SAG-AFTRA actors. To get it, he had to promise not to reuse the actors’ likenesses in other films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;“It’s never about if, it’s just when”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cardoza’s view, AI is “giving voices to creators that otherwise never would have had the voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cardoza isn’t wedded to AI. When an&amp;nbsp;interviewer asked him whether he’d make a non-AI film if required to, he responded, “Oh, 100 percent.” Cardoza added that if he had the budget to do it now, “I’d probably still shoot it all live action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged to me that there will be losers in the transition—“there’s always going to be changes”—but he compares the rise of AI with past technological developments in filmmaking, like the rise of visual effects. This created new jobs making visual effects digitally, but reduced jobs making elaborate physical sets.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza expressed interest in reducing the amount of job loss. In&amp;nbsp;another interview, Cardoza said that for his film project, “we want to make sure we include as many people as possible,” not just actors, but sound designers, script editors, and other specialized roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he believes that eventually, AI will get good enough to do everyone’s job. “Like I say with tech, it’s never about if, it’s just when.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accetturo’s entry into AI was similar. He told me that he worked for 15 years as a filmmaker, “mostly as a commercial director and former documentary director.” During the pandemic, he “raised millions” for an animated TV series, but it got caught up in&amp;nbsp;development hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI gave him a new chance at success. Over the summer of 2024, he started playing around with AI video tools. He realized that he was in the sweet spot to take advantage of AI: experienced enough to make something good, but not so established that he was risking his reputation. After Google released Veo 3 in May, Accetturo released a&amp;nbsp;fake medicine ad that went viral. His studio now produces ads for prominent companies like Oracle and Popeyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accetturo says the backlash against him has subsided: “It truly is nothing compared to what it was.” And he says he’s committed to working on AI: “Everyone understands that it’s the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;“Adapt like cockroaches”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the anti- and pro-AI extremes, there are a lot of editors and artists quietly using AI tools without disclosing it. Unsurprisingly, it’s difficult to find people who will speak about this on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people want plausible deniability right now,” according to&amp;nbsp;Ryan Hayden, a Hollywood talent agent. “There is backlash about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But if editors don’t use AI tools, they risk becoming obsolete. Hayden says that he knows a lot of people in the editing field trying to master AI because “there’s gonna be a massive cut” in the total number of editors. Those who know AI might survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one comedy writer involved in an AI project told&amp;nbsp;Wired, “We wanted to be at the table and not on the menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clandestine AI usage extends into the upper reaches of the industry. Hayden knows an editor who works with a major director who has directed $100 million films. “He’s already using AI, sometimes without people knowing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists feel morally conflicted but don’t think they can effectively resist. Vinny Dellay, a storyboard artist who has worked on Marvel films and Super Bowl ads, released a video&amp;nbsp;detailing his views on the ethics of using AI as a working artist. Dellay said that he agrees that “AI being trained off of art found on the Internet without getting permission from the artist, it may not be fair, it may not be honest.” But refusing to use AI products won’t stop their general adoption. Believing otherwise is “just being delusional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Dellay said that the right course is to “adapt like cockroaches after a nuclear war.” If they’re lucky, using AI in storyboarding workflows might even “let a storyboard artist pump out twice the boards in half the time without questioning all your life’s choices at 3 am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Lines, moral and practical&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gille Klabin is an indie director and filmmaker currently working on a feature called &lt;em&gt;Weekend at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an independent filmmaker, Klabin can’t afford to hire many people. There are many labor-intensive tasks—like making a pitch deck for his film—that he’d otherwise have to do himself. An AI tool “essentially just liberates us to get more done and have more time back in our life.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But he’s careful to stick to his own moral lines. Any time he mentioned using an AI tool during our interview, he’d explain why he thought that was an appropriate choice. He said he was fine with AI use “as long as you’re using it ethically in the sense that you’re not copying somebody’s work and using it for your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing these lines can be difficult, however. Hayden, the talent agent, told me that as AI tools make low-budget films look better, it gets harder to make high-budget films, which employ the most people at the highest wage levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, Klabin’s AI uptake is limited more by the current capabilities of AI models. Klabin is an experienced visual effects artist, and he finds AI products to generally be “not really good enough to be used in a final project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave me a concrete example. Rotoscoping is a process in which you trace out the subject of the shot so you can edit the background independently. It’s very labor-intensive—one has to edit every frame individually—so Klabin has tried using Runway’s AI-driven rotoscoping. While it can make for a decent first pass, the result is just too messy to use as a final project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klabin sent me this GIF of a series of rotoscoped frames from his upcoming movie. While the model does a decent job of identifying the people in the frame, its boundaries aren’t consistent from frame to frame. The result is noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2128523 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="448" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ezgif-5ae8ed4b0b48d022.gif" width="800" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current AI tools are full of these small glitches, so Klabin only uses them for tasks that audiences don’t see (like creating a movie pitch deck) or in contexts where he can clean up the result afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am betting on the audience wanting to trust creators, wanting to see authenticity,” he told me. AI video tools don’t really help him with that and can’t replace the reputation he’s sought to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, he&amp;nbsp;experimented&amp;nbsp;with using ChatGPT to edit a video thumbnail (the image used to advertise a video). He got a couple of negative reactions about his use of AI, so he said he “might slow down a little bit” with that experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robles didn’t seem as concerned about AI models stealing from creators like him. When I asked him about how he felt about&amp;nbsp;Google training on his data, he told me that “YouTube provides me enough benefit that I don’t think too much about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional thumbnail artist&amp;nbsp;Antioch Hwang has a similarly pragmatic view toward using AI. Some channels he works with have audiences that are “very sensitive to AI images.” Even using “an AI upscaler to fix up the edges” can provoke strong negative reactions. For those channels, he’s “very wary” about using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for most channels he works for, he’s fine using AI, at least for technical tasks. “I think there’s now been a big shift in the public perception of these AI image generation tools,” he told me. “People are now welcoming them into their workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s still careful with his AI use, though, because he thinks that having human artistry helps in the YouTube ecosystem. “If everyone has all the [AI] tools, then how do you really stand out?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Recently, top creators have started using more rough-looking thumbnails for their videos. AI has made polished thumbnails too easy to create, so top creators are using what Hwang would call “poorly made thumbnails” to help videos stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Exit strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hwang told me something surprising: even as AI makes it easier for creators to make thumbnails themselves, business has never been better for thumbnail artists, even at the lower end. He said that demand has soared because “AI as a whole has lowered the barriers for content creation, and now there’s more creators flooding in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Hwang doesn’t expect the good times to last forever. “I don’t see AI completely taking over for the next three-ish years. That’s my estimated timeline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone I talked to had different answers to when—if ever—AI would meaningfully disrupt their part of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like Hwang, were pessimistic. Actor Erik Passoja told me he thought the big movie studios—like Warner Bros. or Paramount—would be gone in three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others were more optimistic. Tess Dinerstein, the vertical drama actor, said, “I don’t think that verticals are ever going to go fully AI.” Even if it becomes technologically feasible, she argued, “that just doesn’t seem to be what the people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gille Klabin, the independent filmmaker, thought there would always be a place for high-quality human films. If someone’s work is “fundamentally derivative,” then they are at risk. But he thinks the best human-created work will still stand out. “I don’t know how AI could possibly replace the borderline divine element of consciousness,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who were most bullish on AI were, if anything, the least optimistic about their own career prospects. “I think at a certain point it won’t matter,” Kavan Cardoza told me. “It’ll be that anyone on the planet can just type in some sentences” to generate full, high-quality videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might explain why Accetturo has become something of an AI evangelist; his&amp;nbsp;newsletter&amp;nbsp;tries to teach other filmmakers how to adapt to the coming AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI “is a tsunami that is gonna wipe out everyone” he told me. “So I’m handing out surfboards—teaching people how to surf. Do with it what you will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the legendary Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki was shown a bizarre AI-generated video of a misshapen human body crawling across a floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyazaki&amp;nbsp;declared himself&amp;nbsp;“utterly disgusted” by the technology demo, which he considered an “insult to life itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it,” Miyazaki said. “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fans interpreted Miyazaki’s remarks as rejecting AI-generated video in general. So they didn’t like it when, in October 2024, filmmaker&amp;nbsp;PJ Accetturo&amp;nbsp;used AI tools to create a&amp;nbsp;fake trailer for a live-action version of Miyazaki’s animated classic &lt;em&gt;Princess&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mononoke&lt;/em&gt;. The trailer earned him 22 million views on X. It also earned him hundreds of insults and death threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go generate a bridge and jump off of it,” said one of the funnier retorts. Another urged&amp;nbsp;Accetturo to “throw your computer in a river and beg God’s forgiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone&amp;nbsp;tweeted that Miyazaki “should be allowed to legally hunt and kill this man for sport.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of AI image and video generation models has been controversial, to say the least. Artists have accused AI companies of stealing their work to build tools that put people out of a job. Using AI tools openly is stigmatized in many circles, as Accetturo learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as these models have improved, they have sped up workflows and afforded new opportunities for artistic expression. Artists without AI expertise might soon find themselves losing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, I’ve spoken to nine actors, directors, and creators about how they are navigating these tricky waters. Here’s what they told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;The backlash to AI video generation, explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actors have emerged as a powerful force against AI. In 2023,&amp;nbsp;SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors’ union, had its longest-ever strike, partly to&amp;nbsp;establish more protections&amp;nbsp;for actors against AI replicas.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Actors have lobbied to regulate AI in their industry and beyond. One actor I talked with,&amp;nbsp;Erik Passoja, has testified before the California Legislature in favor of several bills, including for greater protections against pornographic deepfakes. SAG-AFTRA endorsed SB 1047, an AI safety bill regulating frontier models. The union also&amp;nbsp;organized&amp;nbsp;against the proposed moratorium on state AI bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent flashpoint came in September, when&amp;nbsp;Deadline Hollywood&amp;nbsp;reported that talent agencies were interested in signing “AI actress” Tilly Norwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actors weren’t happy. Emily Blunt told&amp;nbsp;Variety, “This is really, really scary. Come on agencies, don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natasha Lyonne, star of &lt;em&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/em&gt;, posted on an Instagram Story: “Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds. Deeply misguided &amp;amp; totally disturbed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash was partly specific to Tilly Norwood—Lyonne is no AI skeptic, having cofounded an AI studio—but it also reflects a set of concerns around AI common to many in Hollywood and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how SAG-AFTRA&amp;nbsp;explained its position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilly Norwood is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any “problem” — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement reflects three broad criticisms that come up over and over in discussions of AI art:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Most leading AI video models have been trained on broad swathes of the Internet, including images and films made by artists. In many cases, companies have not asked artists for permission to use this content, nor compensated them. Courts are still working out&amp;nbsp;whether this is fair use under copyright law. But many people I talked to consider AI companies’ training efforts to be theft of artists’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job loss:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If AI tools can make passable video quickly or drastically speed up editing tasks, that potentially takes jobs away from actors or film editors. While past technological advancements have also eliminated jobs—the adoption of digital cameras drastically reduced the number of people cutting physical film—AI could have an even broader impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistic quality:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;A lot of people told me they just didn’t think AI-generated content could ever be good art. Tess Dinerstein stars in vertical dramas—episodic programs optimized for viewing on smartphones. She told me that AI is “missing that sort of human connection that you have when you go to a movie theater and you’re sobbing your eyes out because your favorite actor is talking about their dead mom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern about theft is potentially solvable by changing how models are trained. Around the time Accetturo released the “Princess Mononoke” trailer, he&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;for generative AI tools to be “ethically trained on licensed datasets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have moved in this direction. For instance, independent filmmaker Gille Klabin told me he “feels pretty good” using Adobe products because the company trains its AI models on stock images that it pays royalties for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other two issues—job losses and artistic integrity—will be harder to finesse. Many creators—and fans—believe that AI-generated content misses the fundamental point of art, which is about creating an emotional connection between creators and viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while that point is compelling in theory, the details can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinerstein, the vertical drama actress, told me that she’s “not fundamentally against AI”—she admits “it provides a lot of resources to filmmakers” in specialized editing tasks—but she takes a hard stance against it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to ever explain gray areas on social media,” she said, and she doesn’t want to “come off as hypocritical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though she doesn’t think that AI poses a risk to her job—“people want to see what I’m up to”—she does fear people (both fans and vertical drama studios) making an AI representation of her without her permission. And she has found it easiest to just say, “You know what? Don’t involve me in AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others see it as a much broader issue. Actress&amp;nbsp;Susan Spano&amp;nbsp;told me it was “an issue for humans, not just actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a world of humans and animals,” she said. “Interaction with humans is what makes it fun. I mean, do we want a world of robots?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;How one director leaned into AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s relatively easy for actors to take a firm stance against AI because they inherently do their work in the physical world. But things are more complicated for other Hollywood creatives, such as directors, writers, and film editors. AI tools can genuinely make them more productive, and they’re at risk of losing work if they don’t stay on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the non-actors I talked to took a range of approaches to AI. Some still reject it. Others have used the tools reluctantly and tried to keep their heads down. Still others have openly embraced the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      Kavan Cardoza is a director and AI filmmaker.

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take&amp;nbsp;Kavan Cardoza, for example. He worked as a music video director and photographer for close to a decade before getting his break into filmmaking with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the image model Midjourney was first released in 2022, Cardoza started playing around with image generation and later video generation. Eventually, he “started making a bunch of fake movie trailers” for existing movies and franchises. In December 2024, he made a fan film in the Batman universe that “exploded on the Internet,” before Warner Bros. took it down for copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza acknowledges that he re-created actors in former Batman movies “without their permission.” But he insists he wasn’t “trying to be malicious or whatever. It was truly just a fan film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Accetturo received death threats, the response to Cardoza’s fan film was quite positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every other major studio started contacting me,” Cardoza said. He set up an AI studio, Phantom X, with several of his close friends. Phantom X started by making ads (where AI video is&amp;nbsp;catching on quickest), but Cardoza wanted to focus back on films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Cardoza made a short film called &lt;em&gt;Echo Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, a blend of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;. Some shots look clearly AI-generated, but Cardoza used motion-capture technology from Runway to put the faces of real actors into his AI-generated world. Overall, the piece pretty much hangs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza wanted to work with real actors because their artistic choices can help elevate the script he’s written: “There’s a lot more levels of creativity to it.” But he needed SAG-AFTRA’s approval to make a film that blends AI techniques with the likenesses of SAG-AFTRA actors. To get it, he had to promise not to reuse the actors’ likenesses in other films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;“It’s never about if, it’s just when”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cardoza’s view, AI is “giving voices to creators that otherwise never would have had the voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cardoza isn’t wedded to AI. When an&amp;nbsp;interviewer asked him whether he’d make a non-AI film if required to, he responded, “Oh, 100 percent.” Cardoza added that if he had the budget to do it now, “I’d probably still shoot it all live action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged to me that there will be losers in the transition—“there’s always going to be changes”—but he compares the rise of AI with past technological developments in filmmaking, like the rise of visual effects. This created new jobs making visual effects digitally, but reduced jobs making elaborate physical sets.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Cardoza expressed interest in reducing the amount of job loss. In&amp;nbsp;another interview, Cardoza said that for his film project, “we want to make sure we include as many people as possible,” not just actors, but sound designers, script editors, and other specialized roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he believes that eventually, AI will get good enough to do everyone’s job. “Like I say with tech, it’s never about if, it’s just when.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accetturo’s entry into AI was similar. He told me that he worked for 15 years as a filmmaker, “mostly as a commercial director and former documentary director.” During the pandemic, he “raised millions” for an animated TV series, but it got caught up in&amp;nbsp;development hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI gave him a new chance at success. Over the summer of 2024, he started playing around with AI video tools. He realized that he was in the sweet spot to take advantage of AI: experienced enough to make something good, but not so established that he was risking his reputation. After Google released Veo 3 in May, Accetturo released a&amp;nbsp;fake medicine ad that went viral. His studio now produces ads for prominent companies like Oracle and Popeyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accetturo says the backlash against him has subsided: “It truly is nothing compared to what it was.” And he says he’s committed to working on AI: “Everyone understands that it’s the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;“Adapt like cockroaches”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the anti- and pro-AI extremes, there are a lot of editors and artists quietly using AI tools without disclosing it. Unsurprisingly, it’s difficult to find people who will speak about this on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people want plausible deniability right now,” according to&amp;nbsp;Ryan Hayden, a Hollywood talent agent. “There is backlash about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But if editors don’t use AI tools, they risk becoming obsolete. Hayden says that he knows a lot of people in the editing field trying to master AI because “there’s gonna be a massive cut” in the total number of editors. Those who know AI might survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one comedy writer involved in an AI project told&amp;nbsp;Wired, “We wanted to be at the table and not on the menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clandestine AI usage extends into the upper reaches of the industry. Hayden knows an editor who works with a major director who has directed $100 million films. “He’s already using AI, sometimes without people knowing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some artists feel morally conflicted but don’t think they can effectively resist. Vinny Dellay, a storyboard artist who has worked on Marvel films and Super Bowl ads, released a video&amp;nbsp;detailing his views on the ethics of using AI as a working artist. Dellay said that he agrees that “AI being trained off of art found on the Internet without getting permission from the artist, it may not be fair, it may not be honest.” But refusing to use AI products won’t stop their general adoption. Believing otherwise is “just being delusional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Dellay said that the right course is to “adapt like cockroaches after a nuclear war.” If they’re lucky, using AI in storyboarding workflows might even “let a storyboard artist pump out twice the boards in half the time without questioning all your life’s choices at 3 am.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Lines, moral and practical&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gille Klabin is an indie director and filmmaker currently working on a feature called &lt;em&gt;Weekend at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an independent filmmaker, Klabin can’t afford to hire many people. There are many labor-intensive tasks—like making a pitch deck for his film—that he’d otherwise have to do himself. An AI tool “essentially just liberates us to get more done and have more time back in our life.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But he’s careful to stick to his own moral lines. Any time he mentioned using an AI tool during our interview, he’d explain why he thought that was an appropriate choice. He said he was fine with AI use “as long as you’re using it ethically in the sense that you’re not copying somebody’s work and using it for your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing these lines can be difficult, however. Hayden, the talent agent, told me that as AI tools make low-budget films look better, it gets harder to make high-budget films, which employ the most people at the highest wage levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, Klabin’s AI uptake is limited more by the current capabilities of AI models. Klabin is an experienced visual effects artist, and he finds AI products to generally be “not really good enough to be used in a final project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave me a concrete example. Rotoscoping is a process in which you trace out the subject of the shot so you can edit the background independently. It’s very labor-intensive—one has to edit every frame individually—so Klabin has tried using Runway’s AI-driven rotoscoping. While it can make for a decent first pass, the result is just too messy to use as a final project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klabin sent me this GIF of a series of rotoscoped frames from his upcoming movie. While the model does a decent job of identifying the people in the frame, its boundaries aren’t consistent from frame to frame. The result is noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2128523 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="448" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ezgif-5ae8ed4b0b48d022.gif" width="800" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current AI tools are full of these small glitches, so Klabin only uses them for tasks that audiences don’t see (like creating a movie pitch deck) or in contexts where he can clean up the result afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am betting on the audience wanting to trust creators, wanting to see authenticity,” he told me. AI video tools don’t really help him with that and can’t replace the reputation he’s sought to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, he&amp;nbsp;experimented&amp;nbsp;with using ChatGPT to edit a video thumbnail (the image used to advertise a video). He got a couple of negative reactions about his use of AI, so he said he “might slow down a little bit” with that experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robles didn’t seem as concerned about AI models stealing from creators like him. When I asked him about how he felt about&amp;nbsp;Google training on his data, he told me that “YouTube provides me enough benefit that I don’t think too much about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional thumbnail artist&amp;nbsp;Antioch Hwang has a similarly pragmatic view toward using AI. Some channels he works with have audiences that are “very sensitive to AI images.” Even using “an AI upscaler to fix up the edges” can provoke strong negative reactions. For those channels, he’s “very wary” about using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for most channels he works for, he’s fine using AI, at least for technical tasks. “I think there’s now been a big shift in the public perception of these AI image generation tools,” he told me. “People are now welcoming them into their workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s still careful with his AI use, though, because he thinks that having human artistry helps in the YouTube ecosystem. “If everyone has all the [AI] tools, then how do you really stand out?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, top creators have started using more rough-looking thumbnails for their videos. AI has made polished thumbnails too easy to create, so top creators are using what Hwang would call “poorly made thumbnails” to help videos stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Exit strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hwang told me something surprising: even as AI makes it easier for creators to make thumbnails themselves, business has never been better for thumbnail artists, even at the lower end. He said that demand has soared because “AI as a whole has lowered the barriers for content creation, and now there’s more creators flooding in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Hwang doesn’t expect the good times to last forever. “I don’t see AI completely taking over for the next three-ish years. That’s my estimated timeline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone I talked to had different answers to when—if ever—AI would meaningfully disrupt their part of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like Hwang, were pessimistic. Actor Erik Passoja told me he thought the big movie studios—like Warner Bros. or Paramount—would be gone in three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others were more optimistic. Tess Dinerstein, the vertical drama actor, said, “I don’t think that verticals are ever going to go fully AI.” Even if it becomes technologically feasible, she argued, “that just doesn’t seem to be what the people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gille Klabin, the independent filmmaker, thought there would always be a place for high-quality human films. If someone’s work is “fundamentally derivative,” then they are at risk. But he thinks the best human-created work will still stand out. “I don’t know how AI could possibly replace the borderline divine element of consciousness,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who were most bullish on AI were, if anything, the least optimistic about their own career prospects. “I think at a certain point it won’t matter,” Kavan Cardoza told me. “It’ll be that anyone on the planet can just type in some sentences” to generate full, high-quality videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might explain why Accetturo has become something of an AI evangelist; his&amp;nbsp;newsletter&amp;nbsp;tries to teach other filmmakers how to adapt to the coming AI revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI “is a tsunami that is gonna wipe out everyone” he told me. “So I’m handing out surfboards—teaching people how to surf. Do with it what you will.”&lt;/p&gt;

Much of this comes down to the infrastructure that supports AI, as most systems are not built to run inference at the speed or scale real applications need. Industry studies show many projects miss their ROI goals even after heavy investment in GenAI tools because of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap shows how much AI infrastructure influences performance, cost, and the ability to scale real-world deployments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akamai is trying to address this challenge with Inference Cloud, built with NVIDIA and powered by the latest Blackwell GPUs. The idea is simple: if most AI applications need to make decisions in real time, then those decisions should be made close to users rather than in distant data centres. That shift, Akamai claims, can help companies manage cost, reduce delays, and support AI services that depend on split-second responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Jenkins, CTO of Cloud Computing at Akamai, explained to &lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt; why this moment is forcing enterprises to rethink how they deploy AI and why inference, not training, has become the real bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why AI projects struggle without the right infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenkins says the gap between experimentation and full-scale deployment is much wider than many organisations expect. “Many AI initiatives fail to deliver on expected business value because enterprises often underestimate the gap between experimentation and production,” he says. Even with strong interest in GenAI, large infrastructure bills, high latency, and the difficulty of running models at scale often block progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110833" height="683" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jay-Jenkins-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jay Jenkins, CTO of Cloud Computing at Akamai.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies still rely on centralised clouds and large GPU clusters. But as use grows, these setups become too expensive, especially in regions far from major cloud zones. Latency also becomes a major issue when models have to run multiple steps of inference over long distances. “AI is only as powerful as the infrastructure and architecture it runs on,” Jenkins says, adding that latency often weakens the user experience and the value the business hoped to deliver. He also points to multi-cloud setups, complex data rules, and growing compliance needs as common hurdles that slow the move from pilot projects to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why inference now demands more attention than training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Asia Pacific, AI adoption is shifting from small pilots to real deployments in apps and services. Jenkins notes that as this happens, day-to-day inference – not the occasional training cycle – is what consumes most computing power. With many organisations rolling out language, vision, and multimodal models in multiple markets, the demand for fast and reliable inference is rising faster than expected. This is why inference has become the main constraint in the region. Models now need to operate in different languages, regulations, and data environments, often in real time. That puts enormous pressure on centralised systems that were never designed for this level of responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How edge infrastructure improves AI performance and cost&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenkins says moving inference closer to users, devices, or agents can reshape the cost equation. Doing so shortens the distance data must travel and allows models to respond faster. It also avoids the cost of routing huge volumes of data between major cloud hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical AI systems – robots, autonomous machines, or smart city tools – depend on decisions made in milliseconds. When inference runs distantly, these systems don’t work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The savings from more localised deployments can also be substantial. Jenkins says Akamai analysis shows enterprises in India and Vietnam see large reductions in the cost of running image-generation models when workloads are placed at the edge, rather than centralised clouds. Better GPU use and lower egress fees played a major role in those savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where edge-based AI is gaining traction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early demand for edge inference is strongest from industries where even small delays can affect revenue, safety, or user engagement. Retail and e-commerce are among the first adopters because shoppers often abandon slow experiences. Personalised recommendations, search, and multimodal shopping tools all perform better when inference is local and fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance is another area where latency directly affects value. Jenkins says workloads like fraud checks, payment approval, and transaction scoring rely on chains of AI decisions that should happen in milliseconds. Running inference closer to where data is created helps financial firms move faster and keeps data inside regulatory borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why cloud and GPU partnerships matter more now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI workloads grow, companies need infrastructure that can keep up. Jenkins says this has pushed cloud providers and GPU makers into closer collaboration. Akamai’s work with NVIDIA is one example, with GPUs, DPUs, and AI software deployed in thousands of edge locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to build an “AI delivery network” that spreads inference across many sites instead of concentrating everything in a few regions. This helps with performance, but it also supports compliance. Jenkins notes that almost half of large APAC organisations struggle with differing data rules across markets, which makes local processing more important. Emerging partnerships are now shaping the next phase of AI infrastructure in the region, especially for workloads that depend on low-latency responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is built into these systems from the start, Jenkins says. Zero-trust controls, data-aware routing, and protections against fraud and bots are becoming standard parts of the technology stacks on offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The infrastructure needed to support agentic AI and automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running agentic systems – which make many decisions in sequence – needs infrastructure that can operate at millisecond speeds. Jenkins believes the region’s diversity makes this harder but not impossible. Countries differ widely in connectivity, rules, and technical readiness, so AI workloads must be flexible enough to run where it makes the most sense. He points to research showing that most enterprises in the region already use public cloud in production, but many expect to rely on edge services by 2027. That shift will require infrastructure that can hold data in-country, route tasks to the closest suitable location, and keep functioning when networks are unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What companies need to prepare for next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As inference moves to the edge, companies will need new ways to manage operations. Jenkins says organisations should expect a more distributed AI lifecycle, where models are updated across many sites. This requires better orchestration and strong visibility into performance, cost, and errors in core and edge systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data governance becomes more complex but also more manageable when processing stays local. Half of the region’s large enterprises already struggle with the variance in regulations, so placing inference closer to where data is generated can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security also needs more attention. While spreading inference to the edge can improve resilience, it also means every site must be secured. Firms need to protect APIs, data pipelines, and guard against fraud or bot attacks.
