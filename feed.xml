&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;China’s&amp;nbsp;internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips on Wednesday, as first reported by the Financial Times.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agency also told tech companies&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;ByteDance and Alibaba to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beijing had previously discouraged&amp;nbsp;companies&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;buying these chips in late August, instead promoting alternatives from local manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This ban will deliver quite a blow to China’s tech ecosystem. While companies like Huawei and Alibaba design AI chips locally, Nvidia is by far the global market leader, and its chips are considered to be some of the most advanced on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked for comment, Nvidia provided the following statement from CEO Jensen Huang at a press conference on Wednesday: “We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,”&amp;nbsp;Huang said. “I’m&amp;nbsp;disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And&amp;nbsp;I’m&amp;nbsp;patient about it.&amp;nbsp;We’ll&amp;nbsp;continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Trump administration hit&amp;nbsp;semiconductor&amp;nbsp;companies, including Nvidia, with&amp;nbsp;licensing requirements&amp;nbsp;to sell their AI chips in China in April.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Nvidia’s first-quarter earnings call, Huang had said Nvidia was going to endure $8 billion of revenue loss in the second quarter alone by not being able to sell its H20 AI chips in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June,&amp;nbsp;Nvidia said that&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;wouldn’t include China&amp;nbsp;in its future profit and forecast as it was&amp;nbsp;essentially locked&amp;nbsp;out of the market.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July, the Trump administration reversed course and gave semiconductor companies the green light to&amp;nbsp;sell their chips in China&amp;nbsp;again. In August, the White House announced it would grant the licenses needed&amp;nbsp;to sell in China, but&amp;nbsp;with a catch:&amp;nbsp;the U.S. government would get&amp;nbsp;15% of the revenue&amp;nbsp;from the chips sold.&amp;nbsp;But as of Nvidia’s latest earnings, the company had yet to sell any units to Chinese customers under the plan, citing the slow implementation of President Trump’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2219673294.jpg?resize=1200,750" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Nvidia just got shut out of the Chinese market&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;this time by the Chinese government instead of the US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, former Twitter head of product Kayvon Beykpour announced the launch of Macroscope, an AI system aimed at developers and product leaders that summarizes updates to a codebase and catches bugs, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup was co-founded by Beykpour, now Macroscope CEO, in July 2023, along with childhood friend Joe Bernstein, also previously of Periscope and their prior enterprise startup, Terriblyclever, which was sold to Blackboard in 2009. They’re joined by co-founder Rob Bishop, who sold his computer vision and machine learning company, Magic Pony Technology, to Twitter in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company describes its product as an “AI-powered understanding engine” that’s designed to save engineers time, and the type of product the founders “wish we’d had” when building their earlier companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt; Today, engineers use a variety of tools to keep track of work, like JIRA, Linear, and spreadsheets, and spend too much time in meetings instead of building, Beykpour says. Macroscope is designed to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046985" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Productivity-Stats.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Macroscope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I feel like I lived this pain…at every company I worked at, whether it was the startups that we built ourselves, or whether it was enormous public companies like Twitter, we sort of lived this problem the hard way,” Beykpour told TechCrunch in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Trying to get a sense for what everyone was doing, especially when you have an organization like Twitter with thousands of engineers, it was literally most of my job — and my least favorite part of my job as the head of product at Twitter,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this issue and others, Macroscope’s customers first install its GitHub app, which gives the company access to the code base. They can then optionally install other integrations, like a Slack app, Linear app, and JIRA app. The software then does the rest of the work by analyzing the code and noting what’s changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This involves a process called code walking, which uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) — a structural representation of programming code — to gather important context about how the customer’s code base works. That knowledge is then used in conjunction with large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046981" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pull-request-Descriptions.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Macroscope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once up and running, engineers can use Macroscope to discover bugs to fix in their PRs (pull requests), summarize their PRs, get a summary of how the codebase is changing, and ask code research-based questions. Meanwhile, product leaders could use the software to get real-time summaries of product updates, productivity insights, answers to natural language questions about the product, code, or development activity, and more. This can help them determine what teams are prioritizing in terms of engineering allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046984" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ask-Macroscope-Anything.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Macroscope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can ask natural language questions, regardless of what your technical ability is,” notes Beykpour. “This might be very useful if you’re trying to learn about the code base without distracting a senior engineer on your team. Very valuable. If you’re a CEO and you want to understand literally, ‘what did we get done this week?’, your options are either ask Macroscope or go distract some teammates,” he adds. “One is a lot more expensive than the other.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046980" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bug-Finding-and-Fixing.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Macroscope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While there isn’t a product that offers a direct competitor to all that Macroscope offers, it does compete in the code review space — where developers examine and test code changes before they’re implemented — with tools like CodeRabbit, Cursor Bugbot, Graphite Diamond, Greptile, and others. However, the company said when it ran its own internal benchmark of over 100 real-world bugs, its product caught 5% more bugs than the next-best tool. It also generated 75% fewer comments. (It shared its benchmark publicly in a blog post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046989" height="323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/macroscope-benchmark-2025-09-17-at-3.06.46PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Macroscope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software costs $30 per active developer per month, starting at five seats, and offers enterprise pricing and custom integrations for larger businesses. It requires the use of GitHub Cloud. Ahead of its launch, a number of startups and larger firms have been using the product, including XMTP, Things, United Masters, Bilt, Class.com, Seed.com, ParkHub, A24 Labs, and others. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The San Francisco-based startup has a team of 20 and is backed by $30 million in Series A funding, which was closed in July and led by Michael Mignano at Lightspeed. Other investors include Adverb, Thrive Capital, and Google Ventures. To date, Macroscope has raised $40 million total.&lt;/p&gt;

Ahead of its launch, a number of startups and larger firms have been using the product, including XMTP, Things, United Masters, Bilt, Class.com, Seed.com, ParkHub, A24 Labs, and others. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The San Francisco-based startup has a team of 20 and is backed by $30 million in Series A funding, which was closed in July and led by Michael Mignano at Lightspeed. Other investors include Adverb, Thrive Capital, and Google Ventures. To date, Macroscope has raised $40 million total.&lt;/p&gt;

These services come with a hefty price tag and often take weeks to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Keplar, a market research startup, uses voice AI to conduct customer interviews, providing clients with analysis much faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research consulting firms. On Wednesday, the two-year-old company announced that it raised $3.4 million in seed funding led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from SV Angel, Common Metal, and South Park Commons.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea for Keplar was conceived in 2023 when Dhruv Guliani (above right), previously an engineer at Google, where he worked on speech and voice AI models, and machine learning engineer William Wen, participated in the South Park Commons founder fellowship program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The duo spoke with market researchers and brand managers and realized that the tools these professionals rely on — written surveys and interviews conducted by humans — can now be replaced by conversational AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Keplar, companies can set up studies in minutes, Guliani told TechCrunch. The startup’s platform can turn any question about the product into an interview moderation guide. Keplar’s voice assistant will then reach out to participants and will ask them probing questions to understand what customers like and dislike about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Keplar is granted access to the client’s CRM, the AI voice researcher will reach out to existing customers. The results of AI conversations are then packaged into reports and PowerPoint presentations, similar to those traditionally provided by human market researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Relying on voice bots before advancements in LLMs would not have been possible. But voice AI has become so good that study participants sometimes forget they are speaking to AI, Guliani said.&lt;/p&gt;

A source close to the deal said the round valued Irregular at $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our view is that soon, a lot of economic activity is going to come from human-on-AI interaction and AI-on-AI interaction,” co-founder Dan Lahav told TechCrunch, “and that’s going to break the security stack along multiple points.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Formerly known as Pattern Labs, Irregular is already a significant player in AI evaluations. The company’s work is cited in security evaluations for Claude 3.7 Sonnet as well as OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models. More generally, the company’s framework for scoring a model’s vulnerability-detection ability (dubbed SOLVE) is widely used within the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Irregular has done significant work on models’ existing risks, the company is fundraising with an eye towards something even more ambitious: spotting emergent risks and behaviors before they surface in the wild. The company has constructed an elaborate system of simulated environments, enabling intensive testing of a model before it is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have complex network simulations where we have AI both taking the role of attacker and defender,” says co-founder Omer Nevo. “So when a new model comes out, we can see where the defenses hold up and where they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Security has become a point of intense focus for the AI industry, as the potential risks posed by frontier models as more risks have emerged. OpenAI overhauled its internal security measures this summer, with an eye towards potential corporate espionage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, AI models are increasingly adept at finding software vulnerabilities — a power with serious implications for both attackers and defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Anthropic's AI models could potentially help spies analyze classified documents, but the company draws the line at domestic surveillance. That restriction is reportedly making the Trump administration angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Semafor reported that Anthropic faces growing hostility from the Trump administration over the AI company's restrictions on law enforcement uses of its Claude models. Two senior White House officials told the outlet that federal contractors working with agencies like the FBI and Secret Service have run into roadblocks when attempting to use Claude for surveillance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friction stems from Anthropic's usage policies that prohibit domestic surveillance applications. The officials, who spoke to Semafor anonymously, said they worry that Anthropic enforces its policies selectively based on politics and uses vague terminology that allows for a broad interpretation of its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions affect private contractors working with law enforcement agencies who need AI models for their work. In some cases, Anthropic's Claude models are the only AI systems cleared for top-secret security situations through Amazon Web Services'&amp;nbsp;GovCloud, according to the officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic offers a specific service for national security customers and made a deal with the federal government to provide its services to agencies for a nominal $1 fee. The company also works with the Department of Defense, though its policies still prohibit the use of its models for weapons development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, OpenAI announced a competing agreement to supply more than 2 million federal executive branch workers with ChatGPT Enterprise access for $1 per agency for one year. The deal came one day after the General Services Administration signed a blanket agreement allowing OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to supply tools to federal workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wedged between money and ethics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the friction with the Trump administration creates complications for Anthropic as the company reportedly conducts media outreach in Washington. The administration has repeatedly positioned American AI companies as key players in global competition and expects reciprocal cooperation from these firms. However, this is not Anthropic's first known conflict with Trump administration officials. The company previously opposed proposed legislation that would have prevented US states from passing their own AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Anthropic has been walking a difficult road between maintaining its company values, seeking contracts, and raising venture capital to support its business. For example, in November 2024, Anthropic announced a partnership with Palantir and Amazon Web Services to bring Claude to US intelligence and defense agencies through Palantir's Impact Level 6 environment, which handles data up to the "secret" classification level. The partnership drew criticism from some in the AI ethics community who saw it as contradictory to Anthropic's stated focus on AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the larger stage, the potential surveillance capabilities of AI language models have drawn scrutiny from security researchers. In a December 2023 Slate editorial, security researcher Bruce Schneier warned that AI models could enable unprecedented mass spying by automating the analysis and summarization of vast conversation datasets. He noted that traditional spying methods require intensive human labor, but AI systems can process communications at scale, potentially shifting surveillance from observing actions to interpreting intent through sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI models become capable of processing human communications at unprecedented scale, the battle over who gets to use them for surveillance (and under what rules) is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Anthropic's AI models could potentially help spies analyze classified documents, but the company draws the line at domestic surveillance. That restriction is reportedly making the Trump administration angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Semafor reported that Anthropic faces growing hostility from the Trump administration over the AI company's restrictions on law enforcement uses of its Claude models. Two senior White House officials told the outlet that federal contractors working with agencies like the FBI and Secret Service have run into roadblocks when attempting to use Claude for surveillance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friction stems from Anthropic's usage policies that prohibit domestic surveillance applications. The officials, who spoke to Semafor anonymously, said they worry that Anthropic enforces its policies selectively based on politics and uses vague terminology that allows for a broad interpretation of its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions affect private contractors working with law enforcement agencies who need AI models for their work. In some cases, Anthropic's Claude models are the only AI systems cleared for top-secret security situations through Amazon Web Services'&amp;nbsp;GovCloud, according to the officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic offers a specific service for national security customers and made a deal with the federal government to provide its services to agencies for a nominal $1 fee. The company also works with the Department of Defense, though its policies still prohibit the use of its models for weapons development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, OpenAI announced a competing agreement to supply more than 2 million federal executive branch workers with ChatGPT Enterprise access for $1 per agency for one year. The deal came one day after the General Services Administration signed a blanket agreement allowing OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to supply tools to federal workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wedged between money and ethics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the friction with the Trump administration creates complications for Anthropic as the company reportedly conducts media outreach in Washington. The administration has repeatedly positioned American AI companies as key players in global competition and expects reciprocal cooperation from these firms. However, this is not Anthropic's first known conflict with Trump administration officials. The company previously opposed proposed legislation that would have prevented US states from passing their own AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Anthropic has been walking a difficult road between maintaining its company values, seeking contracts, and raising venture capital to support its business. For example, in November 2024, Anthropic announced a partnership with Palantir and Amazon Web Services to bring Claude to US intelligence and defense agencies through Palantir's Impact Level 6 environment, which handles data up to the "secret" classification level. The partnership drew criticism from some in the AI ethics community who saw it as contradictory to Anthropic's stated focus on AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the larger stage, the potential surveillance capabilities of AI language models have drawn scrutiny from security researchers. In a December 2023 Slate editorial, security researcher Bruce Schneier warned that AI models could enable unprecedented mass spying by automating the analysis and summarization of vast conversation datasets. He noted that traditional spying methods require intensive human labor, but AI systems can process communications at scale, potentially shifting surveillance from observing actions to interpreting intent through sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI models become capable of processing human communications at unprecedented scale, the battle over who gets to use them for surveillance (and under what rules) is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This topped the rumored numbers when word leaked in July that Groq was raising. At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Groq, which also sells data center computing power,&amp;nbsp;previously raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation&amp;nbsp;in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Groq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq’s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs, (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine — specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster.&amp;nbsp;The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google and OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Groq’s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq emerged from stealth.&amp;nbsp;TPUs still power Google Cloud’s AI services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Groq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company talked to TechCrunch a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

The smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that picks up on subtle hand gestures, called Meta Neural Band, the same one it unveiled at last year’s Connect as part of its Orion demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the new product, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, onstage at the company’s annual developer conference, Meta Connect 2025. Unlike Orion, Zuckerberg says this is a product that people can buy in a couple of weeks, starting September 30, and they’ll cost $799.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is Meta’s latest attempt to ship a pair of consumer smart glasses that can handle many of the tasks users traditionally do on a smartphone. For years, Meta has been forced to reach users through its competitors’ devices, namely those sold by Google and Apple. While Meta has invested billions in virtual reality headsets, AI-powered smart glasses now seem like the most promising way for the company to connect with users on its own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta aims to build off the success of its original Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which the company has sold millions of pairs of with its eyewear partner, EssilorLuxottica. Much like Ray-Ban Meta, the Meta Ray-Ban Display comes equipped with an on-board AI assistant, as well as cameras, speakers, and microphones. The glasses let users connect to the cloud to access the internet and social media apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047149" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-8.24.11PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;(Credit: Meta)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta says the display enables users to do much more with their smart glasses. Users are capable of displaying Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Users can also view directions and see live translations in the smart glasses’ display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Neural Band that ships alongside the device looks similar to a Fitbit, but without a screen, and allows users to navigate apps with small hand movements. Zuckerberg said onstage that the Meta Neural Band has 18 hours of battery life and is water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The device uses electromyography (EMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture. Meta is betting this interface will be a new way users can control their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, a video leaked of Meta’s latest smart glasses. CNBC and Bloomberg previously reported that the smart glasses, which were internally codenamed Hypernova, would be unveiled at this year’s Connect conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that Meta Ray-Ban Display are far less capable than the Orion smart glasses Meta showed off at Connect 2024. That device featured augmented reality lenses and eye tracking, while this pair uses a much simpler display. It may be years before Meta ever sells Orion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Meta is hoping it can win the smart glasses race by being first to market with a real product. However, it seems likely that Google and Apple will launch smart glasses of their own in the years to come. Those devices will undoubtedly be able to integrate into Google and Apple’s respective operating systems, giving them a significant leg up over Meta.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta on Wednesday unveiled a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a built-in display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, a video leaked of Meta’s latest smart glasses. CNBC and Bloomberg previously reported that the smart glasses, which were internally codenamed Hypernova, would be unveiled at this year’s Connect conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that Meta Ray-Ban Display are far less capable than the Orion smart glasses Meta showed off at Connect 2024. That device featured augmented reality lenses and eye tracking, while this pair uses a much simpler display. It may be years before Meta ever sells Orion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Meta is hoping it can win the smart glasses race by being first to market with a real product. However, it seems likely that Google and Apple will launch smart glasses of their own in the years to come. Those devices will undoubtedly be able to integrate into Google and Apple’s respective operating systems, giving them a significant leg up over Meta.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:25:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] India leads the way on Google’s Nano Banana with a local creative twist (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s Nano Banana image-generation model, officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, has fueled global momentum for the Gemini app since launching last month. But in India, it has taken on a creative life of its own, with retro portraits and local trends going viral — even as privacy and safety concerns begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has emerged as the No. 1 country in terms of Nano Banana usage, according to David Sharon, multimodal generation lead for Gemini Apps at Google DeepMind, who spoke at a media session this week. The model’s popularity has also propelled the Gemini app to the top of the free app charts on both the App Store and Google Play in India. The app has also climbed to the top of global app stores’ charts, according to Appfigures.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given India’s scale — the world’s second-largest smartphone market and second-biggest online population after China — it is no surprise the country is leading in adoption. But what is catching Google’s attention is not just how many people are using Nano Banana, it is how: Millions of Indians are engaging with the AI model in ways that are uniquely local, highly creative, and in some cases, completely unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the standout trends is Indians using Nano Banana to re-create retro looks inspired by 1990s Bollywood, imagining how they might have appeared during that era, complete with period-specific fashion, hairstyles, and makeup. This trend is local to India, Sharon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A variation of the retro trend is what some are calling the “AI saree,” where users generate vintage-style portraits of themselves wearing traditional Indian attire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046990" height="699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-gemini-app-retro-look-sample.jpg" width="1364" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Nano Banana’s Retro trend sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another trend local to India is people generating their selfies in front of cityscapes and iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben and the U.K.’s retro telephone booths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We saw a lot of that in the beginning,” Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian users are also experimenting with Nano Banana to transform objects, create time-travel effects, and even reimagine themselves as retro postage stamps. Others are generating black-and-white portraits or using the model to visualize encounters with their younger selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these trends did not originate in India, but the country played a key role in helping them gain global attention. One example is the figurine trend, where people generate miniature versions of themselves, often placing them in front of a computer screen. The trend first emerged in Thailand, spread to Indonesia, and became global after gaining traction in India, Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046986" height="1920" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-gemini-app-nano-banana-figurine-sample_eba7c5.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Nano Banana’s Figurine samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to Nano Banana, Google has observed a trend where Indian users are utilizing its Veo 3 AI video-generation model on the Gemini app to create short videos from old photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All of this has helped drive Gemini’s popularity on both the App Store and Google Play in India. Between January and August, the app saw an average of 1.9 million monthly downloads in the country — about 55% higher than in the U.S. — accounting for 16.6% of global monthly downloads, per Appfigures data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India downloads have totaled 15.2 million this year until August; the U.S., on the other hand, has had 9.8 million downloads so far this year, per Appfigures data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Daily downloads of the Gemini app in India significantly surged following the release of the Nano Banana update, beginning on September 1 with 55,000 installs across both app stores. Downloads peaked at 414,000 on September 13 — a 667% increase — with Gemini holding the top overall spot on the iOS App Store since September 10 and on Google Play since September 12, including across all categories, Appfigures data shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3046991" height="1176" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gemini-app-daily-downloads.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite India leading in downloads, the country does not top in-app purchases on the Gemini app, which has generated an estimated $6.4 million in global consumer spending on iOS since launch, per Appfigures. The U.S. accounts for the largest share at $2.3 million (35%), while India contributes $95,000 (1.5%). However, India posted a record 18% month-over-month growth in spending, reaching $13,000 between September 1 and 16 — compared to an 11% global increase during the same period. That puts India seven percentage points above the global rate and more than 17 points ahead of the U.S., where growth was under 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, as with other AI apps, there are concerns about users uploading personal photos to Gemini to transform their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When a user asks us to fulfill their query, we do our best to fulfill that query. We don’t try to assume what the user’s intent is,” Sharon said while addressing questions on how Google is dealing with data misuse and privacy concerns among users in India and other top markets. “We’ve really tried to improve that, and we have improved that to be bold and fulfil your request.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google places a visible, diamond-shaped watermark on images generated by the Nano Banana model and also embeds a hidden marker using its SynthID tool to identify AI-generated content. SynthID allows Google to detect and flag whether an image was created using its models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sharon told reporters that Google is testing a detection platform with trusted testers, researchers, and other experts. The company also plans to launch a consumer-facing version that would allow anyone to check whether an image is AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is still day one, and we’re still learning, and we’re learning together. There are things that we might need to improve on in the future, and it’s really your feedback from users, press, academia, and experts that helps us improve,” Sharon said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s Nano Banana image-generation model, officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, has fueled global momentum for the Gemini app since launching last month.
