The integration supports over 400 core digital tasks, allowing users to compare personalised recommendations in platforms and complete payments without leaving the chatbot environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agentic transformation of commercial services lets the maximal integration of user services and enhances user stickiness,” Shaochen Wang, research analyst at Counterpoint Research, told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, referring to stronger long-term user engagement that creates sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The super app advantage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, ByteDance upgraded its Doubao AI chatbot in December to autonomously handle tasks, including ticket bookings, through integrations with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. The upgraded model was introduced on a ZTE-developed prototype smartphone as a system-level AI assistant; however, some planned features were later scaled back due to privacy and security concerns raised by rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tencent President Martin Lau indicated during the company’s May 2025 earnings call that AI agents could become core components of the WeChat ecosystem, which serves over one billion users with integrated messaging, payments, e-commerce and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positioning reflects China’s structural advantage in agentic AI deployment: integrated ecosystems that eliminate the fragmentation constraining Western competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI agents will be foundational to the evolution of super apps, with success depending on deep integration in payments, logistics, and social engagement,” Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester, told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;. “Chinese firms like Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance all benefit from integrated ecosystems, rich behavioural data, and consumer familiarity with super apps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western companies face more fragmented data environments and stricter privacy regulations that slow cross-service integration, despite leading in foundational AI model development and global reach, Dai noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Agentic AI’s enterprise trajectory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial applications signal broader enterprise implications as agentic AI moves from auxiliary tools to autonomous actors capable of executing complex workflows. Industry experts expect multi-agent systems to emerge as a defining trend in AI deployment this year, extending from consumer services into organisational production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a report by Global Times, Tian Feng, president of the Fast Think Institute and former dean of SenseTime’s Intelligence Industry Research Institute, predicted that the first AI agent to surpass 300 million monthly active users could emerge as early as 2026, becoming “an indispensable assistant for work and daily life” capable of autonomously executing cross-app, composite services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately half of all consumers already use AI when searching online, according to a 2025 McKinsey study. The research firm estimated that AI agents could generate more than $1 trillion in economic value for US businesses by 2030 through streamlining routine steps in consumer decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese cloud providers, including smaller players like JD Cloud and UCloud, have also begun supporting agentic AI tools, though high token use has driven some providers, like ByteDance’s Volcano Engine, to introduce fixed-subscription pricing models to address cost concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Divergent deployment strategies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrasting approaches between Chinese integration and Western scalability reflect fundamental differences in market structure and regulatory environments that will likely define competitive positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China will prioritise domestic integration and expansion in selected regions, while US firms focus on global scalability and governance,” Dai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US players pursuing agentic commerce include OpenAI, Perplexity, and Amazon, while Google explores positioning itself as a “matchmaker” between merchants, consumers and AI agents – approaches that reflect fragmented platform environments requiring interoperability not closed-loop integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the autonomous nature of agentic systems has raised regulatory questions in China. ByteDance warned users about security and privacy risks when announcing Doubao’s abilities, recommending deployment on dedicated devices not those containing sensitive information, given the tool’s access to device data, digital accounts and internet connectivity in multiple ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid commercialisation of agentic AI in China’s consumer sector provides enterprise decision-makers globally with early signals of how autonomous systems may reshape customer acquisition costs, platform economics and competitive moats as these abilities mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Philip Oroni)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Deloitte sounds alarm as AI agent deployment outruns safety frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

They’ve even said it’s &lt;em&gt;morally&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They established what they consider a new philosophy, and&amp;nbsp;they called it Vitalism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’re starting to make progress.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng&lt;/strong&gt;—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it&amp;nbsp;here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the&amp;nbsp;cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen people&amp;nbsp;draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their&amp;nbsp;plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers.&amp;nbsp;Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, powerful people who influence&amp;nbsp;state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter&amp;nbsp;Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led&amp;nbsp;Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?”&lt;/strong&gt; she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover.

At PepsiCo, AI is being tested in places where mistakes are costly and changes are hard to undo — factory layouts, production lines, and physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift is visible in how PepsiCo is using AI and digital twins to model and adjust its manufacturing facilities before making changes in the real world. Rather than experimenting with chat interfaces or office tools, the company is applying AI to one of its core problems: how to configure factories faster, with less risk, and fewer disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital twins are virtual models of physical systems. In manufacturing, they can simulate equipment placement, material flow, and production speed. When combined with AI, these models can test thousands of scenarios that would be impractical — or expensive — to try on a live production line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo has been working with partners to apply AI-driven digital twins to parts of its manufacturing network, with early pilots focused on improving how facilities are designed and adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is not automation for its own sake. It is cycle time. Instead of taking weeks or months to validate changes through physical trials, teams can test configurations virtually, identify problems earlier, and move faster when updates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-planning-bottleneck-to-operational-shortcut"&gt;From planning bottleneck to operational shortcut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In large consumer goods companies, factory changes tend to move slowly. Even small adjustments — a new line layout, different packaging flow, or equipment upgrade — can require long planning cycles, approvals, and staged testing. Each delay has knock-on effects on supply chains and product availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital twins offer a way around that bottleneck. By simulating production environments, teams can see how changes might affect throughput, safety, or downtime before touching the actual facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo’s early pilots showed faster validation times and signs of throughput improvement at initial sites, though the company has not published detailed metrics yet. What matters more than the numbers is the pattern: AI is being used to compress decision cycles in physical operations, not to replace workers or remove human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of use case fits a broader trend. Enterprises that move beyond pilot projects often focus on narrow, well-defined problems where AI can reduce friction in existing workflows. Manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare operations are showing more traction than open-ended knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-pepsico-treats-ai-as-operations-engineering-not-office-productivity"&gt;Why PepsiCo treats AI as operations engineering, not office productivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo’s approach also highlights a quieter shift in how AI programs are being justified inside large firms. The value is tied to operational outcomes — time saved, fewer disruptions, better planning — rather than general claims about productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction matters. Many enterprise AI efforts stall because they struggle to connect usage with measurable impact. Tools get deployed, but workflows stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital twins change that dynamic because they sit directly inside planning and engineering processes. If a simulated change cuts weeks off a factory upgrade, the benefit is visible. If it reduces downtime risk, operations teams can measure that over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This focus on process change, rather than tools, mirrors what is happening in other sectors. In healthcare, for example, Amazon is testing an AI assistant inside its One Medical app that uses patient history to reduce repetitive intake and support care interactions, according to comments from CEO Andy Jassy reported this week. The assistant is embedded in the care workflow, not offered as a standalone feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cases point to the same lesson: AI adoption moves faster when it fits into how work already gets done, instead of asking teams to invent new habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-for-other-enterprises"&gt;Why this matters for other enterprises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo’s digital-twin work is unlikely to be unique for long. Large manufacturers across food, chemicals, and industrial goods face similar planning constraints and cost pressures. Many already use simulation software. AI adds speed and scale to those models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more interesting is what this says about the next phase of enterprise AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the centre of gravity is shifting away from broad, generic tools toward focused systems tied to specific decisions. Second, success depends less on model quality and more on data quality, process ownership, and governance. A digital twin is only as useful as the operational data feeding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, this kind of AI work tends to stay out of the spotlight. It does not generate flashy demos, but it can reshape how companies plan capital spending and manage risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That also explains why many firms remain cautious. Building and maintaining accurate digital twins takes time, cross-team coordination, and deep knowledge of physical systems. The payoff comes from repeated use, not one-off wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepsico-s-manufacturing-ai-work-is-a-quiet-signal-worth-watching"&gt;PepsiCo’s manufacturing AI work is a quiet signal worth watching&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AI coverage, it is easy to focus on new models, agents, or interfaces. Stories like PepsiCo’s point in a different direction. They show AI being treated as infrastructure — something that sits underneath daily decisions and gradually changes how work flows through an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, the takeaway is not to copy the technology stack. It is to look for places where planning delays, validation cycles, or operational risk slow the business down. Those friction points are where AI has the best chance of sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo’s digital-twin pilots suggest that the factory floor may be one of the most practical testing grounds for AI today — not because it is trendy, but because the impact is easier to see when time and mistakes have a clear cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by NIKHIL)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Deloitte sounds alarm as AI agent deployment outruns safety frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

At PepsiCo, AI is being tested in places where mistakes are costly and changes are hard to undo — factory layouts, production lines, and physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift is visible in how PepsiCo is using AI and digital twins to model and adjust its manufacturing facilities before making changes in the real world. Rather than experimenting with chat interfaces or office tools, the company is applying AI to one of its core problems: how to configure factories faster, with less risk, and fewer disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital twins are virtual models of physical systems. In manufacturing, they can simulate equipment placement, material flow, and production speed. When combined with AI, these models can test thousands of scenarios that would be impractical — or expensive — to try on a live production line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo has been working with partners to apply AI-driven digital twins to parts of its manufacturing network, with early pilots focused on improving how facilities are designed and adjusted over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is not automation for its own sake.

However, less than two weeks on, Travelers’ leadership explained that the company’s true competitive advantage lies in expertise, not AIs alone, believing this is what will drive longer-term profit growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Travelers’ chief executive officer Alan Schnitzer, over 20,000 professionals at the company currently “use AI tools regularly.” He also commented on company claims that Travelers’ call centres are experiencing a boost in efficiency at the hands of AI, leading to claims call centre cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI technology and innovation driving growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers’ net profit has increased, according to Schnitzer, largely fuelled by the company’s intensive technology and innovation strategy. Travelers reportedly increased its total value of insurance policies it sold by nearly 7% a year on average between 2016 and 2025. Its underlying combined ratio improved by almost eight points, falling to 83.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnitzer explained that heavy investment in technology has coincided with improved profits. “Notwithstanding a increase in our technology spending, that improvement in underlying profitability includes a 3-point or 10% improvement in our expense ratio. Over the decade, we developed the competitive advantage of an innovation skill set. Now we’re bringing all that Part 1 know-how to Innovation 2.0 at Travelers, powered by AI – and not too far off quantum computing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation 1.0 relates to the company’s strategy and foundation to this success, and it has plans to move into a more advanced stage it’s calling Innovation 2.0, in which AI is the central driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Automation equals call centre culls&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnitzer noted how automation has directly reduced staffing needs and improved claims efficiency, something clearly seen in recent numbers. For instance, Schnitzer said that Travelers’ “claim call centre population is down by a third,” and steps are being taken to consolidate four claims call centres into two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efficiency gains have reduced loss adjustment expenses, improving the company’s loss ratio. Ultimately, investment in automation and analytics have helped Travelers “refine indemnity payouts and drive operational efficiencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnitzer stated that over 50% of all claims made to Travelers are now eligible for straight-through processing, and customers are adopting this processing approximately in two-thirds of cases. He went on to say that: “Another 15% of all claims are processed with advanced digital tools. All of those percentages are growing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite automated tools doing the bulk of claims work, the CEO said that some customers still prefer to call the company to report and discuss claims. Therefore, Travelers has set up an advanced natural language generative AI voice agent that handles initial phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnitzer heralded the success of this voice agent, saying: “Early customer adoption is exceeding our expectation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI and automation reshaping operations in Travelers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of AI and automation are far-reaching, beyond just claims call centres, according to Schnitzer. “Other use cases enhance underwriting decision quality and efficiency and improve the experience for customers, agents, brokers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Toczydlowski, executive vice president and president of business insurance for Travelers, spoke about how gen AI agents have been used to “efficiently mine” data sources, both internally and externally. These help the company “better understand and synthesise the risk characteristics.” Toczydlowski added that the recent agent additions have boosted the speed of underwriting processes and improved segmented pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how the company’s commercial underwriters are performing very well, enhanced by advanced tools used to evaluate risks. Tools include models that refine pricing and summarise past claims data, streamlining the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re not only executing with excellence in the market today, but they’re also helping to shape the transformation of our industry,” Toczydlowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Klein, executive vice president and president of personal insurance for Travelers, underscored AI’s importance in personal insurance, saying it is used to make renewal underwriting “more effective and efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein said, “we start with a proprietary AI-enabled predictive model that scores every account in the property portfolio. Based on this score, accounts with the highest probable risk of loss are presented to underwriters for review. From there, our renewal underwriting platform uses generative AI to consolidate data into summaries of relevant actionable information for our underwriters to evaluate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Klein said that there has been a 30% reduction in average handle times. Therefore, “the net result is that our underwriters focus their efforts on decisions most likely to improve profitability and do so more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Speciality insurance, Jeffrey Klenk, president of bond &amp;amp; speciality insurance at Travelers, commented on how AI has cut times to intake submissions from “hours to just minutes.” He also said AI has recently been implemented to streamline renewals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Innovation 2.0 – AI’s impact on jobs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite claims call centre headcounts already reduced, Schnitzer did not speculate on further cuts. Instead, he emphasised the increasing productivity AI has brought to Travelers. “What I would say is that per employee is up, thanks to some productivity and efficiency initiatives, and we expect per employee to continue to go up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers’ Innovation 1.0 strategy has been the key driver to the company’s strong 10-year profits, according to Schnitzer. Over the decade, we developed the competitive advantage of an innovation skill set. Now we’re bringing all that Part 1 know-how to Innovation 2.0 at Travelers, powered by AI – and not too far off quantum computing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes that AI is set to benefit the entire P/C landscape, highlighting how recent advanced AI tools are able to “understand and execute the complex stakeholder interactions, well-defined processes, data-intensive workflows and massive amounts of unstructured data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnitzer said human expertise with AI “amplifies existing strength,” and said Travelers is investing heavily in “AI and other sophisticated technology solutions.” He said “Dozens of scaled generative AI tools are already in production. Millions of transactions are now automated… And agentic AI isn’t a future aspiration. It’s embedded in our business operations today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI and automated technologies are poised to transform the insurance industry tenfold, as Travelers expects such technologies to “result in faster and more cost-effective delivery of new abilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From product development to new business prospecting to underwriting speed and quality, agent and customer service and more, AI is benefiting Travelers, its customers, and distribution partners, showcasing the technology’s vast impact in the business and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “GOES Satellites Capture Holiday Weather Travel Conditions” by NASA Goddard Photo and Video is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.
