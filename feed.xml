Wednesday was full of talks and presentations by scientists who are trying to understand the nitty-gritty of aging—all the way down to the molecular level. Once we can understand the complex biology of aging, we should be able to slow or prevent the onset of age-related diseases, they hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then my editor forwarded me a video of the leaders of Russia and China talking about immortality.&lt;/strong&gt; “These days at 70 years old you are still a child,” China’s Xi Jinping, 72, was translated as saying, according to footage livestreamed by CCTV to&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;media outlets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With the developments of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality,” Russia’s Vladimir Putin, also 72, is reported to have replied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un walk side by side" class="wp-image-1123157" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25246074253579.jpg?w=2460" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;SERGEI BOBYLEV, SPUTNIK, KREMLIN POOL PHOTO VIA AP&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a striking contrast between that radical vision and the incremental longevity science presented at the meeting. Repeated rounds of organ transplantation surgery aren’t likely to help anyone radically extend their lifespan anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, back to Putin’s proposal: the idea of continually replacing aged organs to stay young. It’s a simplistic way to think about aging. After all, aging is so complicated that researchers can’t agree on what causes it, why it occurs, or even how to define it, let alone “treat” it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having said that, there may be some merit to the idea of repairing worn-out body parts with biological or synthetic replacements.&lt;/strong&gt; Replacement therapies—including bioengineered organs—are being developed by multiple research teams. Some have already been tested in people. This week, let’s take a look at the idea of replacement therapies.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;No one fully understands why our organs start to fail with age. On the face of it, replacing them seems like a good idea. After all, we already know how to do organ transplants. They’ve been a part of medicine since the 1950s and have been used to&amp;nbsp;save hundreds of thousands of lives in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And replacing old organs with young ones might have more broadly beneficial effects.&lt;/strong&gt; When a young mouse is stitched to an old one, the older mouse benefits from the arrangement, and its health seems to improve.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that we don’t really know why. We don’t know what it is about young body tissues that makes them health-promoting. We don’t know how long these effects might last in a person. We don’t know how different organ transplants will compare, either. Might a young heart be more beneficial than a young liver? No one knows.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s before you consider the practicalities of organ transplantation. There is already a shortage of donor organs—thousands of people die on waiting lists. Transplantation requires major surgery and, typically, a lifetime of prescription drugs that damp down the immune system,&amp;nbsp;leaving a person more susceptible to certain infections and diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the idea of repeated organ transplantations shouldn’t really be a particularly appealing one. &lt;/strong&gt;“I don’t think that’s going to happen anytime soon,” says Jesse Poganik, who studies aging at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and is also in Manchester for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Poganik has been collaborating with transplant surgeons in his own research. “The surgeries are good, but they’re not simple,” he tells me. And they come with real risks. His own 24-year-old cousin developed a form of cancer after a liver and heart transplant. She died a few weeks ago, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when it comes to replacing worn-out organs, scientists are looking for both biological and synthetic alternatives.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been replacing body parts for centuries. Wooden toes were used as far back as the 15th century. Joint replacements have been around for more than a hundred years. And major innovations over the last 70 years have given us devices like pacemakers, hearing aids, brain implants, and artificial hearts.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists are exploring other ways to make tissues and organs, too. There are different approaches here, but they include everything from injecting stem cells to seeding “scaffolds” with cells in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1999, researchers used volunteers’ own cells to seed bladder-shaped collagen scaffolds. The resulting bioengineered bladders went on to be transplanted into seven people in&amp;nbsp;an initial trial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now scientists are working on more complicated organs.&lt;/strong&gt; Jean Hébert, a program manager at the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, has been exploring ways to gradually replace the cells in a person’s &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt;. The idea is that, eventually, the recipient will end up with a young brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hébert&amp;nbsp;showed my colleague Antonio Regalado how, in his early experiments, he removed parts of mice’s brains and replaced them with embryonic stem cells. That work seems a world away from the biochemical studies being presented at the British Society for Research on Ageing annual meeting in Manchester, where I am now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, one scientist described how he’d been testing potential longevity drugs on the tiny nematode worm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;. These worms live for only about 15 to 40 days, and his team can perform tens of thousands of experiments with them. About 40% of the drugs that extend lifespan in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; also help mice live longer, he told us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, that’s not an amazing hit rate. &lt;/strong&gt;And we don’t know how many of those drugs will work in people. Probably less than 40% of that 40%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other scientists presented work on chemical reactions happening at the cellular level. It was deep, basic science, and my takeaway was that there’s a lot aging researchers still don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will take years—if not decades—to get the full picture of aging at the molecular level. And if we rely on a series of experiments in worms, and then mice, and then humans, we’re unlikely to make progress for a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long time. In that context, the idea of replacement therapy feels like a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Replacement is a really exciting avenue because you don’t have to understand the biology of aging as much,” &lt;/strong&gt;says Sierra Lore, who studies aging at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lore says she started her research career studying aging at the molecular level, but she soon changed course. She now plans to focus her attention on replacement therapies. “I very quickly realized we’re decades away [from understanding the molecular processes that underlie aging],” she says. “Why don’t we just take what we already know—replacement—and try to understand and apply it better?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So perhaps Putin’s straightforward approach to delaying aging holds some merit. Whether it will grant him immortality is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

The new “Imagine Lens” is available to Snapchat+ Platinum and Lens+ subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Imagine Lens allows users to create, edit, and re-create Snaps by entering their own prompts. They can then share the image with their friends, post it to their Story, or share it outside of Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Snapchat already has numerous generative AI Lenses, the company notes that Imagine Lens is its first open prompt image-generation Lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can generate images using custom prompts, like “create an image of a grumpy cat” or “turn me into an alien.” The Lens also features pre-loaded prompts that people can use, such as “Turn me into a four to five panel comic where something unexpected but heroic happens,” “Make me into a funny caricature,” and “Make this person skydive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042845" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16x9.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Snap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Snapchat notes that users can always tap the caption bar to edit their prompt into anything they’d like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, Snap unveiled an AI text-to-image research model for mobile devices that it said would power some of Snapchat’s features in the future. While Snap didn’t confirm whether this model powers the new Lens, it did note that its Lenses are built using a combination of both in-house models and industry-leading AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Snapchat+ Platinum and Lens+ subscribers can find the new Lens in the front of the Lens Carousel or in the Exclusive category. After selecting the Lens, they can tap the caption to enter or edit the prompt. A Platinum subscription costs $15.99 per month, while a Lens+ subscription costs $8.99 per month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Snap has been seen as a leader in AR but has also been investing in AI over the past few years alongside nearly every other tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months ago, the company launched a stand-alone Lens Studio iOS app and web tool designed to make it easier for anyone to create AR Lenses using AI and simple tools. And in March, it rolled out its first-ever video generative AI Lenses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Snapchat is launching a new Lens that lets users create and edit images using a text-to-image AI generator, the company told TechCrunch exclusively.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Snap has been seen as a leader in AR but has also been investing in AI over the past few years alongside nearly every other tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months ago, the company launched a stand-alone Lens Studio iOS app and web tool designed to make it easier for anyone to create AR Lenses using AI and simple tools. And in March, it rolled out its first-ever video generative AI Lenses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/snapchats-new-lens-lets-you-create-ai-images-using-text-prompts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Download: longevity myths, and sewer-cleaning robots (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/05/1123207/the-download-longevity-myths-and-sewer-cleaning-robots/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin says organ transplants could grant immortality.

 &lt;p&gt;“With the developments of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality,” Russia’s Vladimir Putin, also 72, is reported to have replied.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reality, rounds of organ transplantation surgery aren’t likely to help anyone radically extend their lifespan anytime soon. And it’s a simplistic way to think about aging&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;a process so complicated that researchers can’t agree on what causes it, why it occurs, or even how to define it, let alone “treat” it.

But his previous business shut down in 2019, after halting two of its projects and selling off interests in three more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skelly contends he was early, not wrong.

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is set to produce its own artificial intelligence chip for the first time next year, as the ChatGPT maker attempts to address insatiable demand for computing power and reduce its reliance on chip giant Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chip, co-designed with US semiconductor giant Broadcom, would ship next year, according to multiple people familiar with the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom’s chief executive Hock Tan on Thursday referred to a mystery new customer committing to $10 billion in orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s move follows the strategy of tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Meta, which have designed their own specialised chips to run AI workloads. The industry has seen huge demand for the computing power to train and run AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI planned to put the chip to use internally, according to one person close to the project, rather than make them available to external customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year it began an initial collaboration with Broadcom, according to reports at the time, but the timeline for mass production of a successful chip design had previously been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a call with analysts, Tan announced that Broadcom had secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chip business, as it reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom does not disclose the names of these customers, but people familiar with the matter confirmed OpenAI was the new client. Broadcom and OpenAI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tan said the deal had lifted the company’s growth prospects by bringing “immediate and fairly substantial demand,” shipping chips for that customer “pretty strongly” from next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect that custom AI chips will take a growing share of the booming AI infrastructure market has helped propel Broadcom’s shares more than 30 percent higher this year. They rallied almost 9 percent in pre-market trading in New York on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC analysts have recently noted that they expect to see a much higher growth rate from Broadcom’s custom chip business compared with Nvidia’s chip business in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia continues to dominate the AI hardware space, with the Big Tech “hyperscalers” still representing a significant share of its customer base. But its growth has slowed relative to the astronomical figures it saw at the start of the AI investment boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman has been vocal about the demand for more computing power to serve the number of businesses and consumers using products such as ChatGPT, as well as to train and run AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was one of the earliest customers for Nvidia’s AI chips and has since proven to be a voracious consumer of its hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Altman said the company was prioritising compute “in light of the increased demand from [OpenAI’s latest model] GPT-5” and planned to double its compute fleet “over the next 5 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre’s JUPITER — Europe’s first exascale supercomputer — is officially live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiled today at the supercomputer’s inauguration ceremony in Jülich, JUPITER is accelerating innovative applications that are out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powered by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform, it’s enabling breakthrough research in climate, neuroscience, quantum simulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture, JUPITER can run 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second and is expected to offer up to 90 exaflops of AI performance, delivering more than double the speed for high-performance computing and AI workloads compared with the next-fastest system in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JUPITER marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development,” said Thomas Lippert, director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. “As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture. A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUPITER’s ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by a slew of Europe’s AI and industry leaders, politicians, researchers and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz highlighted how the supercomputer is driving national advancement and industrial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Jupiter is the first European supercomputer, and the first outside the U.S., to have reached this level,” Merz said. “Together today, we are witnesses to a historic European pioneering project.”" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/merz-quote-pulled-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some exceptional numbers behind JUPITER, which 18 Germany-based and 15 European teams are among the first to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips interconnected with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. 51,000 network connections let JUPITER transmit 3x more data than all global data traffic at any given moment.

JEDI, one rack of JUPITER, is the No. 1 most energy-efficient supercomputer." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jupiter-infographic-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate science, including weather prediction and simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) for European languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuroscience, including for drug discovery and mapping the human brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum simulation, to bring quantum computing closer to reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along with many other disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="Aerial view of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre campus, including the modular data center, on the far left, which houses JUPITER." class="full-width-layout__image" height="1151" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aerial-view-julich-campus-scaled.jpeg" width="2048" /&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre and a German consortium of nine European partners from research, industry and the media are tapping JUPITER for TrustLLM, a project that’s training the next generation of LLMs for various European languages. Such LLMs can ease workflows across virtually every industry by generating humanlike responses and improving productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience researcher Thorsten Hater at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre plans to use JUPITER to simulate the behavior of individual neurons on the subcellular level with the Arbor simulator. Such simulations will be crucial for developing therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JUPITER is poised to break the world record for a supercomputer’s ability to handle qubits, the basic units of information in quantum computing. A typical laptop’s memory can handle about 32 qubits. The current record on a supercomputer is 48 qubits. An exascale computer like JUPITER could surpass 50 qubits — a significant milestone for quantum simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Empowering European Researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany and beyond, JUPITER is powering Europe’s most challenging research initiatives, helping scale the continent’s AI leadership with optimal energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular dynamics simulation:&lt;/b&gt; The Max Planck Institute of Biophysics will use JUPITER to simulate the nuclear pore complex — the largest protein assembly in cells — to achieve atom-level insights, advance nuclear transport models and combat retroviruses like HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multilingual LLMs&lt;/b&gt;: With JUPITER, the University of Edinburgh will generate synthetic data to train LLMs that can reason over long documents in any language. More LLMs are being trained through the JUPITER Research and Early Access Program across Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Particle physics: &lt;/b&gt;The University of Wuppertal will use JUPITER to significantly increase the resolution of its microphysical computations, including to study the magnetic moment of an elementary particle, called muon, and potentially discover new particles and interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundation models for video: &lt;/b&gt;Using JUPITER, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich will develop spatio-temporal compression and diffusion architectures that enable the creation of high-quality, accessible video models to advance applications from medical imaging to autonomous driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal AI foundation models&lt;/b&gt;: The University of Lisbon will tap JUPITER to scale multimodal, multilingual, open language models — integrating concepts from machine learning, sparse modeling, information theory and cognitive science — so these LLMs can support all European languages and address the limitations of existing models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre’s JUPITER — Europe’s first exascale supercomputer — is officially live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiled today at the supercomputer’s inauguration ceremony in Jülich, JUPITER is accelerating innovative applications that are out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powered by the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform, it’s enabling breakthrough research in climate, neuroscience, quantum simulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Eviden’s BullSequana XH3000 liquid-cooled architecture, JUPITER can run 1 quintillion FP64 operations per second and is expected to offer up to 90 exaflops of AI performance, delivering more than double the speed for high-performance computing and AI workloads compared with the next-fastest system in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JUPITER marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development,” said Thomas Lippert, director of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. “As the world’s most advanced and versatile exascale system, it represents a unique innovation, opening up completely new possibilities for science and industry in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With JUPITER, Europe gains its most advanced AI supercomputer, built for large-scale simulation and AI, powered by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “JUPITER fuses high-performance computing and AI into a single architecture. A platform for next-generation scientific computing, it will accelerate breakthroughs across every domain — from modeling climate and renewable energy to advancing quantum research, designing new materials and building digital twins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz highlighted how the supercomputer is driving national advancement and industrial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="“Jupiter is the first European supercomputer, and the first outside the U.S., to have reached this level,” Merz said. “Together today, we are witnesses to a historic European pioneering project.”" class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/merz-quote-pulled-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some exceptional numbers behind JUPITER, which 18 Germany-based and 15 European teams are among the first to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__standard-image-section"&gt;
			&lt;img alt="24,000 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips interconnected with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. 51,000 network connections let JUPITER transmit 3x more data than all global data traffic at any given moment. Nearly 1 exabyte of storage. 50 specialized containers comprise JUPITER’s modular data center. JEDI, one rack of JUPITER, is the No. 1 most energy-efficient supercomputer." class="full-width-layout__image" height="819" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jupiter-infographic-1-scaled.jpg" width="2048" /&gt;	
	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUPITER, which stands for “Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,” gives European startups, enterprises and researchers a massive leap in computing power so they can quickly, efficiently create breakthroughs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate science, including weather prediction and simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) for European languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neuroscience, including for drug discovery and mapping the human brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum simulation, to bring quantum computing closer to reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along with many other disciplines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__full-width-image-section"&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is using JUPITER to simulate climate predictions with a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer, depicting extreme weather events such as violent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall much more realistically than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jülich Supercomputing Centre and a German consortium of nine European partners from research, industry and the media are tapping JUPITER for TrustLLM, a project that’s training the next generation of LLMs for various European languages. Such LLMs can ease workflows across virtually every industry by generating humanlike responses and improving productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience researcher Thorsten Hater at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre plans to use JUPITER to simulate the behavior of individual neurons on the subcellular level with the Arbor simulator. Such simulations will be crucial for developing therapies to combat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JUPITER is poised to break the world record for a supercomputer’s ability to handle qubits, the basic units of information in quantum computing. A typical laptop’s memory can handle about 32 qubits. The current record on a supercomputer is 48 qubits. An exascale computer like JUPITER could surpass 50 qubits — a significant milestone for quantum simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="full-width-layout__heading"&gt;Empowering European Researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany and beyond, JUPITER is powering Europe’s most challenging research initiatives, helping scale the continent’s AI leadership with optimal energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="full-width-layout__article-copy-section light"&gt;
	&lt;div class="full-width-layout__copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early flagship projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular dynamics simulation:&lt;/b&gt; The Max Planck Institute of Biophysics will use JUPITER to simulate the nuclear pore complex — the largest protein assembly in cells — to achieve atom-level insights, advance nuclear transport models and combat retroviruses like HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multilingual LLMs&lt;/b&gt;: With JUPITER, the University of Edinburgh will generate synthetic data to train LLMs that can reason over long documents in any language. More LLMs are being trained through the JUPITER Research and Early Access Program across Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Particle physics: &lt;/b&gt;The University of Wuppertal will use JUPITER to significantly increase the resolution of its microphysical computations, including to study the magnetic moment of an elementary particle, called muon, and potentially discover new particles and interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundation models for video: &lt;/b&gt;Using JUPITER, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich will develop spatio-temporal compression and diffusion architectures that enable the creation of high-quality, accessible video models to advance applications from medical imaging to autonomous driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multimodal AI foundation models&lt;/b&gt;: The University of Lisbon will tap JUPITER to scale multimodal, multilingual, open language models — integrating concepts from machine learning, sparse modeling, information theory and cognitive science — so these LLMs can support all European languages and address the limitations of existing models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Listed in Tesla’s proxy statement alongside a company-backed push to raise Musk’s 10-year pay package to $1 trillion, the proposal comes from Stephen Hawk, a Florida shareholder with a $2,000 stake of common stock. His supporting statement reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s integration of Grok into its vehicles demonstrates the tangible benefits of collaboration with xAI. As Tesla pivots toward AI-driven technologies, including Full Self-Driving and robotics, a strategic investment in xAI would secure access to advanced AI capabilities, enhance product innovation, and drive shareholder value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The board, which often suggests investors vote against shareholder proposals, is neutral on this one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Tesla does end up investing in xAI, it would be the second of Musk’s companies to do so. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, has committed to investing $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion equity raise. Analysts have speculated that SpaceX’s involvement in xAI could signal the AI firm is having trouble raising from outside investors.&amp;nbsp;(Musk also merged X, the company formerly known as Twitter, with xAI earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some Tesla shareholders have argued that xAI is a rival to Tesla, since Musk has often described his EV company as an AI company. Last year, shareholders sued Musk and the company for allowing Musk to start a rival AI firm, but the case was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hawk’s proposal comes as Tesla grapples with weakening EV sales and a lackluster robotaxi rollout. The company has attempted to direct investor attention away from those headwinds and toward Tesla’s AI efforts, which center on testing and deploying autonomous vehicles and Optimus, its humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk has argued that he requires more of a controlling stake in Tesla to lead the company’s AI efforts, rather than get distracted by his other AI company. Alongside the proposal to invest in xAI, shareholders will vote on a Tesla-backed 10-year compensation plan for Musk that could give him more than 25% control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filing comes as Tesla continues to appeal a Delaware judge’s decision to strike down Musk’s earlier $56 billion pay package. The new plan would tie Musk’s compensation to ambitious benchmarks, including boosting Tesla’s market value from about $1 trillion today to more than $8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Tesla’s not going to get to $8 trillion market cap based on FSD and robotaxi. To get to that $8 trillion, you kind of need xAI,” Gene Munster,&amp;nbsp;managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “We’re talking numbers that have historically been inconceivable. To get to those, we need things to happen that are inconceivable right now. And one of them is humanoid robots everywhere; that’s probably the biggest lever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The investor noted that xAI could help Tesla reach that market cap in several ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Just the excitement around xAI and Tesla together is going to move Tesla’s valuation higher,” he said, adding that potential returns from that investment and access to xAI’s resources, like compute, could help boost shareholder value and Tesla’s own AI ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s shareholder vote is scheduled for November 6 at 3 p.m. central time at Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas, and will stream live here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2224899009.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Tesla shareholders will soon vote whether to let the electric vehicle maker invest in Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, a proposal pitched as a way to strengthen Tesla’s ambitions in AI, robotics, and energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s integration of Grok into its vehicles demonstrates the tangible benefits of collaboration with xAI. As Tesla pivots toward AI-driven technologies, including Full Self-Driving and robotics, a strategic investment in xAI would secure access to advanced AI capabilities, enhance product innovation, and drive shareholder value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The board, which often suggests investors vote against shareholder proposals, is neutral on this one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Tesla does end up investing in xAI, it would be the second of Musk’s companies to do so. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, has committed to investing $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion equity raise. Analysts have speculated that SpaceX’s involvement in xAI could signal the AI firm is having trouble raising from outside investors.&amp;nbsp;(Musk also merged X, the company formerly known as Twitter, with xAI earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some Tesla shareholders have argued that xAI is a rival to Tesla, since Musk has often described his EV company as an AI company. Last year, shareholders sued Musk and the company for allowing Musk to start a rival AI firm, but the case was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hawk’s proposal comes as Tesla grapples with weakening EV sales and a lackluster robotaxi rollout. The company has attempted to direct investor attention away from those headwinds and toward Tesla’s AI efforts, which center on testing and deploying autonomous vehicles and Optimus, its humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk has argued that he requires more of a controlling stake in Tesla to lead the company’s AI efforts, rather than get distracted by his other AI company. Alongside the proposal to invest in xAI, shareholders will vote on a Tesla-backed 10-year compensation plan for Musk that could give him more than 25% control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The filing comes as Tesla continues to appeal a Delaware judge’s decision to strike down Musk’s earlier $56 billion pay package. The new plan would tie Musk’s compensation to ambitious benchmarks, including boosting Tesla’s market value from about $1 trillion today to more than $8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Tesla’s not going to get to $8 trillion market cap based on FSD and robotaxi. To get to that $8 trillion, you kind of need xAI,” Gene Munster,&amp;nbsp;managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “We’re talking numbers that have historically been inconceivable. To get to those, we need things to happen that are inconceivable right now. And one of them is humanoid robots everywhere; that’s probably the biggest lever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The investor noted that xAI could help Tesla reach that market cap in several ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Just the excitement around xAI and Tesla together is going to move Tesla’s valuation higher,” he said, adding that potential returns from that investment and access to xAI’s resources, like compute, could help boost shareholder value and Tesla’s own AI ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a post on X, Alex’s founder Daniel Edrisian said the startup’s team is joining OpenAI’s Codex division, which is building the company’s AI coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Y Combinator-backed Alex was founded in 2024 and sought to integrate AI models into Xcode. Apple, however, earlier this year updated Xcode to let users tap ChatGPT and other AI models without needing external tools. Edrisian didn’t mention if this was a reason his startup’s team has joined OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we started out, Xcode had no AI. Building a “Cursor for Xcode” sounded crazy, but we managed to do it anyway. And, over time, we built the best coding agent for iOS &amp;amp; MacOS apps,” Edrisian wrote in his post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a post on Alex’s blog, the startup said that it would continue supporting existing users, though the app will no longer be able to be downloaded after October 1. The company noted that the team won’t add new features to the tool, but would maintain the product as long as existing users are using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alex’s Y Combinator listing notes that the startup had three people working on the coding tool. It is not clear if all these employees are joining OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’ve asked OpenAI for a comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It offers an AI agent to solve a problem that data analytics products have struggled with for decades: The people who know how to run the big data infrastructure are not the ones who actually need to use the data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With LLMs, business managers can ask questions of their data in natural language. Isotopes’ agent, Aidnn, can provide answers and draft complex planning documents, gathering data from wherever it’s stored, like finance apps, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are countless agentic business analytics offerings out there, but Isotopes’ co-founders have a unique pedigree. Their product is so sophisticated, the startup has already applied for 10 patents, co-founder CEO Arun Murthy told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just over 20 years ago, when Murthy was in his mid-20s, he worked at Yahoo on the team that built an open source project called Hadoop. Hadoop spurred the initial Big Data frenzy of the 2010s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2011, Yahoo spun it out into a company called Hortonworks, with Murthy as co-founder and chief product officer. Just four years after launch, Hortonworks went public. But the rise of new cloud storage tech took its toll on Hadoop’s market, and Hortonworks eventually merged with its biggest rival, Cloudera. The merged company was taken private in 2021 after famed activist investor Carl Icahn got involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Murthy went to Cloudera for a few years during that turmoil, managing about 200 people. Yet, he says, even there he saw the age-old data access problem. He remembers quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts grilling execs on operating details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They couldn’t always answer because they didn’t have access to the data. “It was embarrassing,” he admits now. “We were a big data company selling this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2021, he left that job with no real plan on what to do next, and a VC introduced him to Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. After a few chats with Wang and a bit of consulting work, Murthy joined Scale as chief technology officer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was like “getting a PhD at Scale,” he describes. “Understanding what drives these models and how to improve them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But when his old buddy from Hortonworks, Prasanth Jayachandran, called him, the two decided to do their own AI startup. They persuaded their third-cofounder, Gopal Vijayaraghavan, also from the Hortonworks days, to join them&amp;nbsp;and in late 2024 founded Isotopes. Their seed round was led by Vab Goel at NTTVC. (Goel was previously at NorWest Ventures.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders’ backgrounds has allowed them to build an agent that can find data from wherever it is stored (be it Salesforce or Snowflake), but then also clean the data. The agent also maintains plenty of context memory to be useful for complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is far beyond a simple chatbot,” Murthy said. For example, if the team is asking Aidnn to draft a report on monthly recurring revenue trends, “the data that you want to chat with actually doesn’t exist, at least the form that you need to chat with. It’s a multistep plan, a very complex plan: extract metadata, read the data, clean and normalize, join the data, prorate revenue, aggregate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent also shows its steps, reasoning, assumptions, and points to anomalies in the data. It will even make recommendations on how to proceed. Isotopes also promises that enterprise customers can deploy without sharing any of their data to the AI model makers powering the agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, as sophisticated as Isotopes may be, the startup faces plenty of competition. Incumbents like Salesforce’s Tableau already offer agents (amid Salesforce’s major AI agent push), and plenty of other startup founders with impressive pedigrees are in the market, too, such as WisdomAI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Isotopes-AI-cofounders.jpeg?w=940" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Isotopes AI came out of stealth on Thursday with a healthy $20 million seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

The engine room of this growth is a thriving and rapidly expanding community of over 5,800 AI companies—a 58 percent increase since 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about big tech, either. The surge is being driven from the ground up by exciting startups. Small and medium-sized businesses make up over 90 percent of the new entrants, fuelling a wave of innovation across the country. This translates to real jobs, with employment in the sector jumping by a third to more than 86,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feryal Clark MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for AI and Digital Government, said: “This means that since 2022, the UK AI sector has grown 150 times faster than the economy at large. This growth reflects the increasing integration of AI across the economy, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and professional services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s fuelling this impressive expansion? A torrent of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence has not just returned; it has reignited, with a record £2.9 billion investment pouring into dedicated AI firms in 2024. The UK has also become a top destination for international capital, attracting £15 billion in inward investment projects this year, which are expected to create over 6,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While London and the South East remain the UK’s AI heartland, the boom is rippling out across the nation. Regions like the West Midlands, the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber have seen the number of local AI firms at least double since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, beneath the surface of these bullish headlines, the UK AI sector is suffering from growing pains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy and Governance at NTT DATA, “The sector is clearly booming, but the study also reveals the pressure points. Companies are struggling to find enough skilled people, and late-stage capital remains thin whilst the lines remain blurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the UK is a world-class incubator for new ideas, the report notes a frustrating lack of the later-stage growth funding needed to turn promising AI startups into global giants. As one investor put it, the UK is “very good at the start phase, but [that at] the scale up phase (beyond Series A), there’s a missing piece there”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond funding, businesses are calling for a clearer rulebook on how to operate. Grandi warns that long-term success of the UK AI sector depends on building trust, a task made harder by regulatory uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Successful AI adoption hinges on how much we can trust it,” Grandi says. “The government’s AI sector study shows rapid expansion alongside a security-first drift, but safety and ethics need to be kept firmly in view, or adoption will slow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to the EU’s more structured approach as a model for the clarity that companies are craving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firms need a rule book that they can apply. Legislation such as the EU AI Act is backed by practical guidance, and countries such as Ireland are already outlining compliance steps,” Grandi explains. “It’s this level of certainty that gives companies a clear path forward, and the UK must provide the same clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the mood on the ground around AI investment remains positive. 58 percent of AI firms expect their revenues to grow by 50 percent or more in the coming year. The growth potential for the UK AI sector is undeniable, but as Grandi concludes, seizing it will require confronting these issues head-on to achieve “responsible, inclusive, and commercially viable AI innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the UK Government itself, a three-month trial by the Department for Business &amp;amp; Trade of Microsoft Copilot yielded less exciting results. It’s perhaps a good thing, then, that US federal government workers are getting free access to Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switzerland releases 100% open AI model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This growth reflects the increasing integration of AI across the economy, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and professional services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s fuelling this impressive expansion? A torrent of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence has not just returned; it has reignited, with a record £2.9 billion investment pouring into dedicated AI firms in 2024. The UK has also become a top destination for international capital, attracting £15 billion in inward investment projects this year, which are expected to create over 6,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While London and the South East remain the UK’s AI heartland, the boom is rippling out across the nation. Regions like the West Midlands, the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber have seen the number of local AI firms at least double since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, beneath the surface of these bullish headlines, the UK AI sector is suffering from growing pains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Isabella Grandi, Director for Data Strategy and Governance at NTT DATA, “The sector is clearly booming, but the study also reveals the pressure points. Companies are struggling to find enough skilled people, and late-stage capital remains thin whilst the lines remain blurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the UK is a world-class incubator for new ideas, the report notes a frustrating lack of the later-stage growth funding needed to turn promising AI startups into global giants. As one investor put it, the UK is “very good at the start phase, but [that at] the scale up phase (beyond Series A), there’s a missing piece there”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond funding, businesses are calling for a clearer rulebook on how to operate. Grandi warns that long-term success of the UK AI sector depends on building trust, a task made harder by regulatory uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Successful AI adoption hinges on how much we can trust it,” Grandi says. “The government’s AI sector study shows rapid expansion alongside a security-first drift, but safety and ethics need to be kept firmly in view, or adoption will slow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to the EU’s more structured approach as a model for the clarity that companies are craving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firms need a rule book that they can apply. Legislation such as the EU AI Act is backed by practical guidance, and countries such as Ireland are already outlining compliance steps,” Grandi explains. “It’s this level of certainty that gives companies a clear path forward, and the UK must provide the same clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the mood on the ground around AI investment remains positive. 58 percent of AI firms expect their revenues to grow by 50 percent or more in the coming year. The growth potential for the UK AI sector is undeniable, but as Grandi concludes, seizing it will require confronting these issues head-on to achieve “responsible, inclusive, and commercially viable AI innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the UK Government itself, a three-month trial by the Department for Business &amp;amp; Trade of Microsoft Copilot yielded less exciting results. It’s perhaps a good thing, then, that US federal government workers are getting free access to Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switzerland releases 100% open AI model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users can now branch conversations into multiple parallel threads, serving as a useful reminder that AI chatbots aren't people with fixed viewpoints but rather malleable tools you can rewind and redirect. The company released the feature for all logged-in web users following years of user requests for the capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature works by letting users hover over any message in a ChatGPT conversation, click "More actions," and select "Branch in new chat." This creates a new conversation thread that includes all the conversation history up to that specific point, while preserving the original conversation intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it almost like creating a new copy of a "document" to edit while keeping the original version safe—except that "document" is an ongoing AI conversation with all its accumulated context. For example, a marketing team brainstorming ad copy can now create separate branches to test a formal tone, a humorous approach, or an entirely different strategy—all stemming from the same initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature addresses a longstanding limitation in the AI model where ChatGPT users who wanted to try different approaches had to either overwrite their existing conversation after a certain point by changing a previous prompt or start completely fresh. Branching allows exploring what-if scenarios easily—and unlike in a human conversation, you can try multiple different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study conducted by researchers from Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Technology suggested that linear dialogue interfaces for LLMs poorly serve scenarios involving "multiple layers, and many subtasks—such as brainstorming, structured knowledge learning, and large project analysis." The study found that linear interaction forces users to "repeatedly compare, modify, and copy previous content," increasing cognitive load and reducing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some software developers have already responded positively to the update, with some comparing the feature to Git, the version control system that lets programmers create separate branches of code to test changes without affecting the main codebase. The comparison makes sense: Both allow you to experiment with different approaches while preserving your original work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI frames the new feature as a response to user requests, the capability isn't new to the AI industry. Anthropic's Claude has offered conversation branching for over a year, allowing users to switch between branches with navigational arrow buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of conversational branching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen from recent headlines, many ChatGPT users intuitively interact with AI chatbots as if they're conversing with a consistent personality—asking ChatGPT for "its opinion" or treating responses as authoritative answers from a knowledgeable entity. This anthropomorphic approach can potentially limit productivity by encouraging users to accept a single AI-generated perspective rather than exploring multiple analytical approaches to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in a piece about how an AI system simulates a humanlike personality, "When you stop seeing an LLM as a 'person' that does work for you and start viewing it as a tool that enhances your own ideas, you can craft prompts to direct the engine's processing power, iterate to amplify its ability to make useful connections, and explore multiple perspectives in different chat sessions rather than accepting one fictional narrator's view as authoritative. You are providing direction to a connection machine—not consulting an oracle with its own agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no inherent authority in AI chatbot outputs, so conversational branching is an ideal way to explore that "multiple-perspective" potential. You are guiding the LLM's outputs with your prompting. Non-linear conversational branching is just one more feature to remind you that an AI chatbot's simulated perspective is mutable, changeable, and highly guided by your own inputs in addition to the training data that forged its underlying neural network. You are guiding the outputs every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, know that ChatGPT is highly capable of confabulating information on topics that aren't well-represented in the dataset and potentially misleading users in topics they aren't experts on, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we've seen from recent headlines, many ChatGPT users intuitively interact with AI chatbots as if they're conversing with a consistent personality—asking ChatGPT for "its opinion" or treating responses as authoritative answers from a knowledgeable entity. This anthropomorphic approach can potentially limit productivity by encouraging users to accept a single AI-generated perspective rather than exploring multiple analytical approaches to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote in a piece about how an AI system simulates a humanlike personality, "When you stop seeing an LLM as a 'person' that does work for you and start viewing it as a tool that enhances your own ideas, you can craft prompts to direct the engine's processing power, iterate to amplify its ability to make useful connections, and explore multiple perspectives in different chat sessions rather than accepting one fictional narrator's view as authoritative. You are providing direction to a connection machine—not consulting an oracle with its own agenda."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no inherent authority in AI chatbot outputs, so conversational branching is an ideal way to explore that "multiple-perspective" potential. You are guiding the LLM's outputs with your prompting. Non-linear conversational branching is just one more feature to remind you that an AI chatbot's simulated perspective is mutable, changeable, and highly guided by your own inputs in addition to the training data that forged its underlying neural network. You are guiding the outputs every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, know that ChatGPT is highly capable of confabulating information on topics that aren't well-represented in the dataset and potentially misleading users in topics they aren't experts on, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As first reported by Reuters, Warner Bros. says that Midjourney knowingly engaged in wrongful conduct, noting that the company previously restricted subscribers from generating content based on infringing images but recently lifted those protections.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, the return of any profits earned from the alleged infringement, and a halt to further violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Warner Bros.’ lawsuit follows a similar one filed in June by Walt Disney and Universal against Midjourney for copyright infringement involving characters such as Darth Vader, Bart Simpson, Shrek, and others. In this case, Midjourney has argued that using those works to train generative AI models is legal under the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;

The company also announced increased earnings for creators, new AI tools to boost creation, and other advancements in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new short-form video experience, called “Roblox Moments,” is launching in beta for users 13 and older. It allows users to capture clips of their gameplay, then edit and share those clips in a scrollable feed. Users can trim their clip to up to 30 seconds, add music, and write a description before sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, users can scroll through a feed of gameplay moments shared by the Roblox community, react to the clips using emojis, and jump into an experience right from a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Later this year, Roblox plans to open up API-based capabilities for creators to allow them to build their own in-game creation and discovery systems. For example, creators will be able to showcase trending clips and highlights from their own gameplay and create leaderboards for things like the coolest overtakes in a racing game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042874" height="474" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Moments_Examples_1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox says a gradual rollout of the feature will allow it to test and refine moderation to ensure all content is age-appropriate. All content is subject to moderation before posting, and users can report inappropriate videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the increased earnings for creators, Roblox is increasing the DevEx (Developer Exchange) rate, allowing creators to earn 8.5% more when they convert their earned Robux into cash. Now, 100,000 earned Robux will equal $380, rather than $350 when converted to cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is a significant step that reinforces the company’s dedication to fostering an economy where more creators can thrive and succeed,” the company shared with TechCrunch. “For example, the average revenue for a Top 1000 developer was almost $1 million, up 2.9x since 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of the new AI tools for creators, Roblox is launching a series of new updates that are designed to offer artistic freedom, enhanced functionality, and smarter development assistance, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators will be able to move beyond generating static 3D objects thanks to a new way of generating fully functional objects, starting with select vehicles and weapons categories. For example, a creator could provide the prompt “a sleek, futuristic red sports car,” and Roblox will generate an interactive car that can be driven. From there, creators can alter the car to their liking, such as allowing the doors of the car to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3042876" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Real-Time-Voice-Translation-Render.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Roblox’s new real-time voice chat translation capability will instantly translate voice chat into the listener’s native tongue starting next year for players speaking English, Spanish, French, and German.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox also announced new text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs to allow creators to build more immersive and interactive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The text-to-speech API enables instant narration and character dialogue with 10 customizable English voice presets (with more coming soon), like a nonplayable character (NPC) giving directions. The speech-to-text API supports voice commands, allowing gameplay actions like firing a cannon when a player says, “Fire!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roblox also announced new advancements in performance and fidelity, including a new mode called “Server Authority” that reduces in-game cheating and makes in-game physics interactions more realistic. Plus, avatars will soon have more lifelike motion, including running, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles with natural momentum. There will also be improvements in complex actions for avatars, like grasping items with fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Roblox plans to launch improvements that will allow its platform to run at a higher fidelity across devices without requiring additional effort from creators or sacrificing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The updates announced on Friday follow Roblox’s recent announcement that it’s expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to introduce age and content ratings for games and apps on its platform.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27- &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market this year has clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22 – &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18 – &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7 – &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5 – &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25 –&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal is reportedly on hold as the U.S. works through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China are tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days’ notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia isn’t counting on the U.S. backing off from its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD makes another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and were responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-non-core-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off non-core assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was &lt;/em&gt;originally published on &lt;em&gt;May 9, 2025, and is regularly updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1366897838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s been a tumultuous year for the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that never came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happened so far in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27- &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market this year has clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22 – &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18 – &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12 – &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11 – &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7 – &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5 – &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25 –&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company will no longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and is consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan includes a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it doesn’t provide any concrete information on what these restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel says will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel to begin layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren’t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia lays out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AMD acquires Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tensions start to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel may be starting to offload its non-core units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and were responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule is officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-spins-off-non-core-assets-announces-new-initiative"&gt;Intel spins off non-core assets, announces new initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;
