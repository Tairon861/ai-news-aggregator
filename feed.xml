            &lt;p&gt;For all their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often fall short when given challenging new tasks that require complex reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an accounting firm’s LLM might excel at summarizing financial reports, that same model could fail unexpectedly if tasked with predicting market trends or identifying fraudulent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make LLMs more adaptable, MIT researchers investigated how a certain training technique can be strategically deployed to boost a model’s performance on unfamiliar, difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They show that test-time training, a method that involves temporarily updating some of a model’s inner workings during deployment, can lead to a sixfold improvement in accuracy. The researchers developed a framework for implementing a test-time training strategy that uses examples of the new task to maximize these gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work could improve a model’s flexibility, enabling an off-the-shelf LLM to adapt to complex tasks that require planning or abstraction. This could lead to LLMs that would be more accurate in many applications that require logical deduction, from medical diagnostics to supply chain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genuine learning — what we did here with test-time training — is something these models can’t do on their own after they are shipped. They can’t gain new skills or get better at a task. But we have shown that if you push the model a little bit to do actual learning, you see that huge improvements in performance can happen,” says Ekin Akyürek PhD ’25, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akyürek is joined on the paper by graduate students Mehul Damani, Linlu Qiu, Han Guo, and Jyothish Pari; undergraduate Adam Zweiger; and senior authors Yoon Kim, an assistant professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS and a member of CSAIL. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling hard domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM users often try to improve the performance of their model on a new task using a technique called in-context learning. They feed the model a few examples of the new task as text prompts which guide the model’s outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in-context learning doesn’t always work for problems that require logic and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers investigated how test-time training can be used in conjunction with in-context learning to boost performance on these challenging tasks. Test-time training involves updating some model parameters — the internal variables it uses to make predictions — using a small amount of new data specific to the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored how test-time training interacts with in-context learning. They studied design choices that maximize the performance improvements one can coax out of a general-purpose LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that test-time training is a much stronger form of learning.&amp;nbsp;While simply providing examples can modestly boost accuracy, actually updating the model with those examples can lead to significantly better performance, particularly&amp;nbsp;in challenging domains,” Damani says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-context learning requires a small set of task examples, including problems and their solutions. The researchers use these examples to create a task-specific dataset needed for test-time training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand the size of this dataset, they create new inputs by slightly changing the problems and solutions in the examples, such as by horizontally flipping some input data. They find that training the model on the outputs of this new dataset leads to the best performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers only update a small number of model parameters using a technique called low-rank adaption, which improves the efficiency of the test-time training process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important because our method needs to be efficient if it is going to be deployed in the real world. We find that you can get huge improvements in accuracy with a very small amount of parameter training,” Akyürek says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing new skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamlining the process is key, since test-time training is employed on a per-instance basis, meaning a user would need to do this for each individual task. The updates to the model are only temporary, and the model reverts to its original form after making a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A model that usually takes less than a minute to answer a query might take five or 10 minutes to provide an answer with test-time training, Akyürek adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t want to do this for all user queries, but it is useful if you have a very hard task that you want to the model to solve well. There also might be tasks that are too challenging for an LLM to solve without this method,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their approach on two benchmark datasets of extremely complex problems, such as IQ puzzles. It boosted accuracy as much as sixfold over techniques that use only in-context learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks that involved structured patterns or those which used completely unfamiliar types of data showed the largest performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For simpler tasks, in-context learning might be OK. But updating the parameters themselves might develop a new skill in the model,” Damani says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to use these insights toward the development of models that continually learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term goal is an LLM that, given a query, can automatically determine if it needs to use test-time training to update parameters or if it can solve the task using in-context learning, and then implement the best test-time training strategy without the need for human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is supported, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. For those following this developing story in the news, the revelation was unnerving. For many scientists and engineers, though, it turned out to be—despite its seriousness—a little bit exciting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While possible impact locations included patches of empty ocean, the space rock, called 2024 YR4, also had several densely populated cities in its possible crosshairs, including Mumbai, Lagos, and Bogotá. If the asteroid did in fact hit such a metropolis, the best-case scenario was severe damage; the worst case was outright, total ruin. And for the first time, a group of United Nations–backed researchers began to have high-level discussions about the fate of the world: If this asteroid was going to hit the planet, what sort of spaceflight mission might be able to stop it? Would they ram a spacecraft into it to deflect it? Would they use nuclear weapons to try to swat it away or obliterate it completely?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, planetary defenders all over the world crewed their battle stations to see if we could avoid that fate—and despite the sometimes taxing new demands on their psyches and schedules, they remained some of the coolest customers in the galaxy. “I’ve had to cancel an appointment saying, &lt;em&gt;I cannot come—I have to save the planet&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and one of those who tracked down 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then, just as quick as history was made, experts declared that the danger had passed. On February 24, asteroid trackers issued the all-clear: Earth would be spared, just as many planetary defense researchers had felt assured it would.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising (and rising and rising) danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how, over a span of just two months, a sprawling network of global astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed 2024 YR4, the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was not an exercise,” says Hainaut. This was the real thing: “We really [had] to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;IN THE BEGINNING&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 27, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ASTEROID TERRESTRIAL-IMPACT LAST ALERT SYSTEM, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long ago, an asteroid in the space-rock highway between Mars and Jupiter felt a disturbance in the force: the gravitational pull of Jupiter itself, king of the planets. After some wobbling back and forth, this asteroid was thrown out of the belt, skipped around the sun, and found itself on an orbit that overlapped with Earth’s own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was the first one to see the detections of it,” Larry Denneau, of the University of Hawai‘i, recalls. “A tiny white pixel on a black background.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denneau is one of the principal investigators at the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopic network. It may have been just two days after Christmas, but as usual, he followed procedure as if it were any other day of the year and sent the observations of the tiny pixel onward to another NASA-funded facility, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s an alternate reality in which none of this happened. Fortunately, in our timeline, various space agencies—chiefly NASA, but also the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—invest millions of dollars every year in asteroid-spotting efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And while multiple nations host observatories capable of performing this work, the US clearly leads the way: Its planetary defense program provides funding to a suite of telescopic facilities solely dedicated to identifying potentially hazardous space rocks. (At least, it leads the way for the moment. The White House’s proposal for draconian budget cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation mean that several observatories and space missions linked to planetary defense are facing funding losses or outright terminations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers working at these observatories are tasked with finding threatening asteroids before they find us—because you can’t fight what you can’t see. “They are the first line of planetary defense,” says Kelly Fast, the acting planetary defense officer at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;ATLAS is one part of this skywatching project, and it consists of four telescopes: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and another in South Africa. They don’t operate the way you’d think, with astronomers peering through them all night. Instead, they operate “completely robotically and automatically,” says Denneau. Driven by coding scripts that he and his colleagues have developed, these mechanical eyes work in harmony to watch out for any suspicious space rocks. Astronomers usually monitor their survey of the sky from a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ATLAS telescopes are small, so they can’t see particularly distant objects. But they have a wide field of view, allowing them to see large patches of space at any one moment. “As long as the weather is good, we’re constantly monitoring the night sky, from the North Pole to the South Pole,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Larry Denneau" class="wp-image-1119829" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/denneau-larry.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Larry Denneau, a principal investigator at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescopic network.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they detect the starlight reflecting off a moving object, an operator, such as Denneau, gets an alert and visually verifies that the object is real and not some sort of imaging artifact. When a suspected asteroid (or comet) is identified, the observations are sent to the MPC, which is home to a bulletin board featuring (among other things) orbital data on all known asteroids and comets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the object isn’t already listed, a new discovery is announced, and other astronomers can perform follow-up observations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In just the past few years, ATLAS has detected more than 1,200 asteroids with near-Earth orbits. Finding ultimately harmless space rocks is routine work—so much so that when the new near-Earth asteroid was spotted by ATLAS’s Chilean telescope that December day, it didn’t even raise any eyebrows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau had simply been sitting at home,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;doing some late-night work on his computer. At the time, of course, he didn’t know that his telescope had just spied what would soon become a history-making asteroid—one that could alter the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MPC quickly confirmed the new space rock hadn’t already been “found,” and astronomers gave it a provisional designation: 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CATALINA SKY SURVEY, ARIZONA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the discovery was shared with another NASA-funded facility: the Catalina Sky Survey, a nest of three telescopes in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson that works out of the University of Arizona. “We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of its comet and asteroid spotters. Unlike ATLAS, these telescopes (although aided by automation) often have an in-person astronomer available to quickly alter the surveys in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119794" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kacper_teleskop.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of the comet and asteroid spotters at the Catalina Sky Survey north of Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when Catalina was alerted about what its peers at ATLAS had spotted, staff deployed its Schmidt telescope—a smaller one that excels at seeing bright objects moving extremely quickly. As they fed their own observations of 2024 YR4 to the MPC, Catalina engineer David Rankin looked back over imagery from the previous days and found the new asteroid lurking in a night-sky image taken on December 26. Around then, ATLAS also realized that it had caught sight of 2024 YR4 in a photograph from December 25.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combined observations confirmed it: The asteroid had made its closest approach to Earth on Christmas Day, meaning it was already heading back out into space. But where, exactly, was this space rock going? Where would it end up after it swung around the sun?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to that question was Earth, Davide Farnocchia would be one of the first to know. You could say he’s one of NASA’s watchers on the wall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he’s remarkably calm about his duties. When he first heard about 2024 YR4, he barely flinched. It was just another asteroid drifting through space not terribly far from Earth. It was another box to be ticked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it was logged by the MPC, it was Farnocchia’s job to try to plot out 2024 YR4’s possible paths through space, checking to see if any of them overlapped with our planet’s. He works at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) in California, where he’s partly responsible for keeping track of all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system. “We have 1.4 million objects to deal with,” he says, matter-of-factly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, astronomers would have had to stitch together multiple images of this asteroid and plot out its possible trajectories. Today, fortunately, Farnocchia has some help: He oversees the digital brain Sentry, an autonomous system he helped code. (Two other facilities in Italy perform similar work: the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, or NEOCC, and the privately owned Near-Earth Objects Dynamics Site, or NEODyS.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To chart their courses, Sentry uses every new observation of every known asteroid or comet listed on the MPC to continuously refine the orbits of all those objects, using the immutable laws of gravity and the gravitational influences of any planets, moons, or other sizable asteroids they pass. A recent update to the software means that even the ever-so-gentle push afforded by sunlight is accounted for. That allows Sentry to confidently project the motions of all these objects at least a century into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Davide Farnoccia" class="wp-image-1119827" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/farnocchia-david.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Davide Farnocchia, who helps track all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost all newly discovered asteroids are quickly found to pose no impact risk. But those that stand even an infinitesimally small chance of smashing into our planet within the next 100 years are placed on the Sentry Risk List until additional observations can rule out those awful possibilities. Better safe than sorry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In late December, with just a limited set of data, Sentry concluded that there was a non-negligible chance 2024 YR4 would strike Earth in 2032. Aegis, the equivalent software at Europe’s NEOCC site, agreed. No bother. More observations would very likely remove 2024 YR4 from the Risk List. Just another day at the office for Farnocchia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that an asteroid heading toward Earth isn’t always a problem. Small rocks burn up in the planet’s atmosphere several times a day; you’ve probably seen one already this year, on a moonless night. But above a certain size, these rocks turn from innocuous shooting stars into nuclear-esque explosions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflected starlight is great for initially spotting asteroids, but it’s a terrible way to determine how big they are. A large, dull rock reflects as much light as a bright, tiny rock, making them appear the same to many telescopes. And that’s a problem, considering that a rock around 30 feet long will explode loudly but inconsequentially in Earth’s atmosphere, while a 3,000-foot-long asteroid would slam into the ground and cause devastation on a global scale, imperiling all of civilization. Roughly speaking, if you double the size of an asteroid, it becomes eight times more energetic upon impact—so finding out the size of an Earthbound asteroid is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In those first few hours after it was discovered, and before anyone knew how shiny or dull its surface was, 2024 YR4 was estimated by astronomers to be as small as 65 feet across or as large as 500 feet. An object of the former size would blow up in mid-air, shattering windows over many miles and likely injuring thousands of people. At the latter size it would vaporize the heart of any city it struck, turning solid rock and metal into liquid and vapor, while its blast wave would devastate the rest of it, killing hundreds of thousands or even millions in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now the question was: Just how big &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; 2024 YR4?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;REFINING THE PICTURE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understandably dissatisfied with that level of imprecision, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), high up on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile’s Atacama Desert, entered the chat. As the name suggests, this flagship facility is vast, and it’s capable of really zooming in on distant objects. Or to put it another way: “The VLT is the largest, biggest, best telescope in the world,” says Hainaut, one of the facility’s operators, who usually commands it from half a world away in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reality, the VLT—which lends a hand to the European Space Agency in its asteroid-hunting duties—is actually made up of four massive telescopes, each fixed on four separate corners of the sky. They can be combined to act as a huge light bucket, allowing astronomers to see very faint asteroids. Four additional, smaller, movable telescopes can also team up with their bigger siblings to provide remarkably high-resolution images of even the stealthiest space rocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YR4-2.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much tech to oversee, the control room of the VLT looks a bit like the inside of the Death Star. “You have eight consoles, each of them with a dozen screens. It’s big, it’s large, it’s spectacular,” says Hainaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-January, the European Space Agency asked the VLT to study several asteroids that had somewhat suspicious near-Earth orbits—including 2024 YR4. With just a few lines of code, the VLT could easily train its sharp eyes on an asteroid like 2024 YR4, allowing astronomers to narrow down its size range. It was found to be at least 130 feet long (big enough to cause major damage in a city) and as much as 300 feet (able to annihilate one).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 29, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marco Fenucci" class="wp-image-1119830" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fenucci-marco.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the month, there was no mistaking it: 2024 YR4 stood a greater than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you see very often,” says Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at NEOCC. He admits that although it was “a serious thing,” this escalation was also “exciting to see”—something straight out of a sci-fi flick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sentry and Aegis, along with the systems at NEODyS, had been checking one another’s calculations. “There was a lot of care,” says Farnocchia, who explains that even though their programs worked wonders, their predictions were manually verified by multiple experts. When a rarity like 2024 YR4 comes along, he says, “you kind of switch gears, and you start being more cautious. You start screening everything that comes in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the klaxon emanating from these three data centers pushed the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a UN-backed planetary defense awareness group, to issue a public alert to the world’s governments: &lt;em&gt;The planet may be in peril.&lt;/em&gt; For the most part, it was at this moment that the media—and the wider public—became aware of the threat. Earth, we may have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau, along with plenty of other astronomers, received an urgent email from Fast at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office, requesting that all capable observatories track this hazardous asteroid. But there was one glaring problem. When 2024 YR4 was discovered on December 27, it was already two days after it had made its closest approach to Earth. And since it was heading back out into the shadows of space, it was quickly fading from sight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it gets too faint, “there’s not much ATLAS can do,” Denneau says. By the time of IAWN’s warning, planetary defenders had just weeks to try to track 2024 YR4 and refine the odds of its hitting Earth before they’d lose it to the darkness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if their scopes failed, the odds of an Earth impact would have stayed uncomfortably high until 2028, when the asteroid was due to make another flyby of the planet. That’d be just four short years before the space rock might actually hit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“In that situation, we would have been … in trouble,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The hunt was on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;PREPARING FOR THE WORST&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 5 and February 6, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE MISSION PLANNING ADVISORY GROUP, AUSTRIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early February, spaceflight mission specialists, including those at the UN-supported Space Mission Planning Advisory Group in Vienna, began high-level talks designed to sketch out ways in which 2024 YR4 could be either deflected away from Earth or obliterated—you know, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A range of options were available—including ramming it with several uncrewed spacecraft or assaulting it with nuclear weapons—but there was no silver bullet in this situation. Nobody had ever launched a nuclear explosive device into deep space before, and the geopolitical ramifications of any nuclear-armed nations doing so in the present day would prove deeply unwelcome. Asteroids are also extremely odd objects; some, perhaps including 2024 YR4, are less like single chunks of rock and more akin to multiple cliffs flying in formation. Hit an asteroid like that too hard and you could fail to deflect it—and instead turn an Earthbound cannonball into a spray of shotgun pellets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that early on, experts were concerned about whether they could prevent a potential disaster. Crucially, eight years was not actually much time to plan something of this scale. So they were keen to better pinpoint how likely, or unlikely, it was that 2024 YR4 was going to collide with the planet before any complex space mission planning began in earnest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people involved with these talks—from physicists at some of America’s most secretive nuclear weapons research laboratories to spaceflight researchers over in Europe—were not feeling close to anything resembling panic. But “the timeline was really short,” admits Hainaut. So there was an unprecedented tempo to their discussions. This wasn’t a drill. This was the real deal. What would they do to defend the planet if an asteroid impact couldn’t be ruled out?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, over the next few days, a handful of new observations came in. Each helped Sentry, Aegis, and the system at NEODyS rule out more of 2024 YR4’s possible future orbits. Unluckily, Earth remained a potential port of call for this pesky asteroid—and over time, our planet made up a higher proportion of those remaining possibilities. That meant that the odds of an Earth impact “started bubbling up,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a telescope in each of the four corners points to an asteroid" class="wp-image-1119775" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Redamonti_asteroid_7.2.25.jpg?w=1903" width="1903" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;EVA REDAMONTI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By February 6, they jumped to 2.3%—a one-in-43 chance of an impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“How much anxiety someone should feel over that—it’s hard to say,” Denneau says, with a slight shrug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, several elephantine asteroids have been found to stand a small chance of careening unceremoniously into the planet. Such incidents tend to follow a pattern. As more observations come in and the asteroid’s orbit becomes better known, an Earth impact trajectory remains a possibility while other outlying orbits are removed from the calculations—so for a time, the odds of an impact rise. Finally, with enough observations in hand, it becomes clear that the space rock will miss our world entirely, and the impact odds plummet to zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers expected this to repeat itself with 2024 YR4. But there was no guarantee. There’s no escaping the fact that one day, sooner or later, scientists will discover a dangerous asteroid that will punch Earth in the face—and raze a city in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, asteroids capable of trashing a city have found their way to Earth plenty of times before, and not just in the very distant past. In 1908, an 800-square-mile patch of forest in Siberia—one that was, fortunately, very sparsely populated—was decimated by a space rock just 180 feet long. It didn’t even hit the ground; it exploded in midair with the force of a 15-megaton blast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But only one other asteroid comparable in size to 2024 YR4 had its 2.3% figure beat: in 2004, Apophis—capable of causing continental-scale damage—had (briefly) stood a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapidly approaching uncharted waters, the powers that be at NASA decided to play a space-based wild card: the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A large dull asteroid reflects the same amount of light as a small shiny one, but that doesn’t mean astronomers sizing up an asteroid are helpless. If you view both asteroids in the infrared, the larger one glows brighter than the smaller one no matter the surface coating—making infrared, or the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum, a much better gauge of a space rock’s proportions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Observatories on Earth do have infrared capabilities, but our planet’s atmosphere gets in their way, making it hard for them to offer highly accurate readings of an asteroid’s size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), hanging out in space, doesn’t have that problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A collage of three images showing the black expanse of space. Two-thirds of the collage is taken up by the black background sprinkled with small, blurry galaxies in orange, blue, and white. There are two images in a column at the right side of the collage.

Observations were taken using both its NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to study the thermal properties of the asteroid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA, ESA, CSA, A. RIVKIN (APL), A. PAGAN (STSCI)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This observatory, which sits at a gravitationally stable point about a million miles from Earth, is polymathic. Its sniper-like scope can see in the infrared and allows it to peer at the edge of the observable universe, meaning it can study galaxies that formed not long after the Big Bang. It can even look at the light passing through the atmospheres of distant planets to ascertain their chemical makeups. And its remarkably sharp eye means it can also track the thermal glow of an asteroid long after all ground-based telescopes lose sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a fortuitous bit of timing, by the moment 2024 YR4 came along, planetary defenders had recently reasoned that JWST could theoretically be used to track ominous asteroids using its own infrared scope, should the need arise. So after IAWN’s warning went out, operators of JWST ran an analysis: Though the asteroid would vanish from most scopes by late March, this one might be able to see the rock until sometime in May, which would allow researchers to greatly refine their assessment of the asteroid’s orbit and its odds of making Earth impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understanding 2024 YR4’s trajectory was important, but “the size was the main motivator,” says Andy Rivkin, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the&amp;nbsp;proposal&amp;nbsp;to use JWST to observe the asteroid. The hope was that even if the impact odds remained high until 2028, JWST would find that 2024 YR4 was on the smaller side of the 130-to-300-feet size range—meaning it would still be a danger, but a far less catastrophic one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JWST proposal was accepted by NASA on February 5. But the earliest it could conduct its observations was early March. And time really wasn’t on Earth’s side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 7, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GEMINI SOUTH TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At this point, [2024 YR4] was too faint for the Catalina telescopes,” says Catalina’s Wierzchoś. “In our opinion, this was a big deal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Wierzchoś and his colleagues put in a rare emergency request to commandeer the Gemini Observatory, an internationally funded and run facility featuring two large, eagle-eyed telescopes—one in Chile and one atop Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano. Their request was granted, and on February 7, they trained the Chile-based Gemini South telescope onto 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119781" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gemini_South_Captures_Asteroid_2024_YR4_noirlab2514a.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This composite image  was captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS), by a team of astronomers. The hazy dot at the center is asteroid 2024 YR4.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of Earth impact dropped ever so slightly, to 2.2% —a minor, but still welcome, development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By this point, the roster of 2024 YR4 hunters also included the tiny team operating the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), which sits atop a tranquil mountain in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s myself and my husband,” says Eileen Ryan, the MRO director. “We’re the only two astronomers running the telescope. We have a daytime technician. It’s kind of a mom-and-pop organization.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the scope shouldn’t be underestimated. “We can see maybe a cell-phone-size object that’s illuminated at geosynchronous orbit,” Ryan says, referring to objects 22,000 miles away. But its most impressive feature is its mobility. While other observatories have slowly swiveling telescopes, MRO’s scope can move like the wind. “We can track the fastest objects,” she says, with a grin—noting that the telescope was built in part to watch missiles for the US Air Force. Its agility and long-distance vision explain why the Space Force is one of MRO’s major clients: It can be used to spy on satellites and spacecraft anywhere from low Earth orbit right out to the lunar regions. And that meant spying on the super-speedy, super-sneaky 2024 YR4 wasn’t a problem for MRO, whose own observations were vital in refining the asteroid’s impact odds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Eileen Ryan" class="wp-image-1119831" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ryan-eileen.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Eileen Ryan, the director of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in mid-February, MRO and all ground-based observatories came up against an unsolvable problem: The full moon was out, shining so brightly that it blinded any telescope that dared point at the night sky. “During the full moon, the observatories couldn’t observe for a week or so,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci. To most of us, the moon is a beautiful silvery orb. But to astronomers, it’s a hostile actor. “We abhor the moon,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All any of them could do was wait. Those tracking 2024 YR4 vacillated between being animated and slightly trepidatious. The thought that the asteroid could still stand a decent chance of impacting Earth after it faded from view did weigh a little on their minds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Farnocchia maintained his characteristic sangfroid throughout. “I try to stress about the things I can control,” he says. “All we can do is to explain what the situation is, and that we need new data to say more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the full moon finally faded into a crescent of light, the world’s largest telescopes sprang back into action for one last shot at glory. “The dark time came again,” says Hainaut, with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;New observations finally began to trickle in, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS readjusted their forecasts. It wasn’t great news: The odds of an Earth impact in 2032 jumped up to 3.1%, officially making 2024 YR4 the most dangerous asteroid ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This declaration made headlines across the world—and certainly made the curious public sit up and wonder if they had yet another apocalyptic concern to fret about. But, as ever, the asteroid hunters held fast in their prediction that sooner or later—ideally sooner—more observations would cause those impact odds to drop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We kept at it,” says Ryan. But time was running short; they started to “search for out-of-the-box ways to image this asteroid,” says Fenucci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defense researchers soon realized that 2024 YR4 wasn’t too far away from NASA’s Lucy spacecraft, a planetary science mission making a series of flybys of various asteroids. If Lucy could be redirected to catch up to 2024 YR4 instead, it would give humanity its best look at the rock, allowing Sentry and company to confirm or dispel our worst fears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, NASA ran the numbers, and it proved to be a nonstarter: 2024 YR4 was too speedy and too far for Lucy to pursue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was really starting to look as if JWST would be the last, best hope to track 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CHANGE OF FATE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 19, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE and MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just one day after 2024 YR made history, the VLT, MRO, and others caught sight of it again, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS voraciously consumed their new data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of an Earth impact suddenly dropped to 1.5%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers didn’t really have time to react to the possibility that this was a good sign—they just kept sending their observations onward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 20, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUBARU TELESCOPE, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet another observatory had been itching to get into the game for weeks, but it wasn’t until February 20 that Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, sitting atop Mauna Kea, finally caught 2024 YR4 shifting between the stars. He added his data to the stream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden, the asteroid lost its lethal luster. The odds of its hitting Earth were now just 0.3%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, you might expect that all those tracking it would be in a single control room somewhere, eyes glued to their screens, watching the odds drop before bursting into cheers and rapturous applause. But no—the astronomers who had spent so long observing this asteroid remained scattered across the globe. And instead of erupting into cheers, they exchanged modestly worded emails of congratulations—the digital equivalent of a nod or a handshake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Tsuyoshi Tera at a workstation with many monitors" class="wp-image-1119786" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20200715-subaru-fig-full_Terai.jpg?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In late February, data from Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, which sits atop Mauna Kea, confirmed that 2024 YR4 was not so lethal after all.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a relief,” says Terai. “I was very pleased that our data contributed to put an end to the risk of 2024 YR4.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 24, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few days later, and thanks to a litany of observations continuing to flood in, IAWN issued the all-clear. This once-ominous asteroid’s odds of inconveniencing our planet were at 0.004%—one in 25,000. Today, the odds of an Earth impact in 2032 are exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was kinda fun while it lasted,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defenders may have had a blast defending the world, but these astronomers still took the cosmic threat deeply seriously—and never once took their eyes off the prize. “In my mind, the observers and orbit teams were the stars of this story,” says Fast, NASA’s acting planetary defense officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Farnocchia shrugs off the entire thing. “It was the expected outcome,” he says. “We just didn’t know when that would happen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on it now, though, some 2024 YR4 trackers are allowing themselves to dwell on just how close this asteroid came to being a major danger. “It’s wild to watch it all play out,” says Denneau. “We were weeks away from having to spin up some serious mitigation planning.” But there was no need to work out how the save the world. It turned out that 2024 YR4 was never a threat to begin with—it just took a while to check.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And these experiences in handling a dicey space rock will only serve to make the world a safer place to live. One day, an asteroid very much like 2024 YR4 will be seen heading straight for Earth. And those tasked with tracking it will be officially battle-tested, and better prepared than ever to do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A POSTSCRIPT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the story of 2024 YR4 is not quite over—in fact, if this were a movie, it would have an after-credits scene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the Earth-impact odds fell off a cliff, JWST went ahead with its observations in March anyway. It found out that 2024 YR4 was 200 feet across—so large that a direct strike on a city would have proved horrifically lethal. Earth just didn’t have to worry about it anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the moon might. Thanks in part to JWST, astronomers calculated a 3.8% chance that 2024 YR4 will impact the lunar surface in 2032. Additional JWST observations in May bumped those odds up slightly, to 4.3%, and the orbit can no longer be refined until the asteroid’s next Earth flyby in 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It may hit the moon!” says Denneau. “Everybody’s still very excited about that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lunar collision would give astronomers a wonderful opportunity not only to study the physics of an asteroid impact, but also to demonstrate to the public just how good they are at precisely predicting the future motions of potentially lethal space rocks. “It’s a thing we can plan for without having to defend the Earth,” says Denneau.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If 2024 YR4 is truly going to smash into the moon, the impact—likely on the side facing Earth—would unleash an explosion equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. An expansive crater would be carved out in the blink of an eye, and a shower of debris would erupt in all directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this supersonic wreckage would pose any danger to Earth, but it would look spectacular: You’d be able to see the bright flash of the impact from terra firma with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If that does happen, it’ll be amazing,” says Denneau. It will be a spectacular way to see the saga of 2024 YR4—once a mere speck on his computer screen—come to an explosive end, from a front-row seat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. For those following this developing story in the news, the revelation was unnerving. For many scientists and engineers, though, it turned out to be—despite its seriousness—a little bit exciting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While possible impact locations included patches of empty ocean, the space rock, called 2024 YR4, also had several densely populated cities in its possible crosshairs, including Mumbai, Lagos, and Bogotá. If the asteroid did in fact hit such a metropolis, the best-case scenario was severe damage; the worst case was outright, total ruin. And for the first time, a group of United Nations–backed researchers began to have high-level discussions about the fate of the world: If this asteroid was going to hit the planet, what sort of spaceflight mission might be able to stop it? Would they ram a spacecraft into it to deflect it? Would they use nuclear weapons to try to swat it away or obliterate it completely?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, planetary defenders all over the world crewed their battle stations to see if we could avoid that fate—and despite the sometimes taxing new demands on their psyches and schedules, they remained some of the coolest customers in the galaxy. “I’ve had to cancel an appointment saying, &lt;em&gt;I cannot come—I have to save the planet&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and one of those who tracked down 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then, just as quick as history was made, experts declared that the danger had passed. On February 24, asteroid trackers issued the all-clear: Earth would be spared, just as many planetary defense researchers had felt assured it would.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising (and rising and rising) danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how, over a span of just two months, a sprawling network of global astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed 2024 YR4, the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was not an exercise,” says Hainaut. This was the real thing: “We really [had] to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;IN THE BEGINNING&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 27, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ASTEROID TERRESTRIAL-IMPACT LAST ALERT SYSTEM, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long ago, an asteroid in the space-rock highway between Mars and Jupiter felt a disturbance in the force: the gravitational pull of Jupiter itself, king of the planets. After some wobbling back and forth, this asteroid was thrown out of the belt, skipped around the sun, and found itself on an orbit that overlapped with Earth’s own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was the first one to see the detections of it,” Larry Denneau, of the University of Hawai‘i, recalls. “A tiny white pixel on a black background.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denneau is one of the principal investigators at the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopic network. It may have been just two days after Christmas, but as usual, he followed procedure as if it were any other day of the year and sent the observations of the tiny pixel onward to another NASA-funded facility, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s an alternate reality in which none of this happened. Fortunately, in our timeline, various space agencies—chiefly NASA, but also the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—invest millions of dollars every year in asteroid-spotting efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And while multiple nations host observatories capable of performing this work, the US clearly leads the way: Its planetary defense program provides funding to a suite of telescopic facilities solely dedicated to identifying potentially hazardous space rocks. (At least, it leads the way for the moment. The White House’s proposal for draconian budget cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation mean that several observatories and space missions linked to planetary defense are facing funding losses or outright terminations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers working at these observatories are tasked with finding threatening asteroids before they find us—because you can’t fight what you can’t see. “They are the first line of planetary defense,” says Kelly Fast, the acting planetary defense officer at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;ATLAS is one part of this skywatching project, and it consists of four telescopes: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and another in South Africa. They don’t operate the way you’d think, with astronomers peering through them all night. Instead, they operate “completely robotically and automatically,” says Denneau. Driven by coding scripts that he and his colleagues have developed, these mechanical eyes work in harmony to watch out for any suspicious space rocks. Astronomers usually monitor their survey of the sky from a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ATLAS telescopes are small, so they can’t see particularly distant objects. But they have a wide field of view, allowing them to see large patches of space at any one moment. “As long as the weather is good, we’re constantly monitoring the night sky, from the North Pole to the South Pole,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Larry Denneau" class="wp-image-1119829" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/denneau-larry.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Larry Denneau, a principal investigator at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescopic network.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they detect the starlight reflecting off a moving object, an operator, such as Denneau, gets an alert and visually verifies that the object is real and not some sort of imaging artifact. When a suspected asteroid (or comet) is identified, the observations are sent to the MPC, which is home to a bulletin board featuring (among other things) orbital data on all known asteroids and comets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the object isn’t already listed, a new discovery is announced, and other astronomers can perform follow-up observations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In just the past few years, ATLAS has detected more than 1,200 asteroids with near-Earth orbits. Finding ultimately harmless space rocks is routine work—so much so that when the new near-Earth asteroid was spotted by ATLAS’s Chilean telescope that December day, it didn’t even raise any eyebrows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau had simply been sitting at home,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;doing some late-night work on his computer. At the time, of course, he didn’t know that his telescope had just spied what would soon become a history-making asteroid—one that could alter the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MPC quickly confirmed the new space rock hadn’t already been “found,” and astronomers gave it a provisional designation: 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CATALINA SKY SURVEY, ARIZONA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the discovery was shared with another NASA-funded facility: the Catalina Sky Survey, a nest of three telescopes in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson that works out of the University of Arizona. “We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of its comet and asteroid spotters. Unlike ATLAS, these telescopes (although aided by automation) often have an in-person astronomer available to quickly alter the surveys in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119794" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kacper_teleskop.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of the comet and asteroid spotters at the Catalina Sky Survey north of Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when Catalina was alerted about what its peers at ATLAS had spotted, staff deployed its Schmidt telescope—a smaller one that excels at seeing bright objects moving extremely quickly. As they fed their own observations of 2024 YR4 to the MPC, Catalina engineer David Rankin looked back over imagery from the previous days and found the new asteroid lurking in a night-sky image taken on December 26. Around then, ATLAS also realized that it had caught sight of 2024 YR4 in a photograph from December 25.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combined observations confirmed it: The asteroid had made its closest approach to Earth on Christmas Day, meaning it was already heading back out into space. But where, exactly, was this space rock going? Where would it end up after it swung around the sun?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to that question was Earth, Davide Farnocchia would be one of the first to know. You could say he’s one of NASA’s watchers on the wall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he’s remarkably calm about his duties. When he first heard about 2024 YR4, he barely flinched. It was just another asteroid drifting through space not terribly far from Earth. It was another box to be ticked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it was logged by the MPC, it was Farnocchia’s job to try to plot out 2024 YR4’s possible paths through space, checking to see if any of them overlapped with our planet’s. He works at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) in California, where he’s partly responsible for keeping track of all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system. “We have 1.4 million objects to deal with,” he says, matter-of-factly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, astronomers would have had to stitch together multiple images of this asteroid and plot out its possible trajectories. Today, fortunately, Farnocchia has some help: He oversees the digital brain Sentry, an autonomous system he helped code. (Two other facilities in Italy perform similar work: the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, or NEOCC, and the privately owned Near-Earth Objects Dynamics Site, or NEODyS.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To chart their courses, Sentry uses every new observation of every known asteroid or comet listed on the MPC to continuously refine the orbits of all those objects, using the immutable laws of gravity and the gravitational influences of any planets, moons, or other sizable asteroids they pass. A recent update to the software means that even the ever-so-gentle push afforded by sunlight is accounted for. That allows Sentry to confidently project the motions of all these objects at least a century into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Davide Farnoccia" class="wp-image-1119827" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/farnocchia-david.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Davide Farnocchia, who helps track all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost all newly discovered asteroids are quickly found to pose no impact risk. But those that stand even an infinitesimally small chance of smashing into our planet within the next 100 years are placed on the Sentry Risk List until additional observations can rule out those awful possibilities. Better safe than sorry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In late December, with just a limited set of data, Sentry concluded that there was a non-negligible chance 2024 YR4 would strike Earth in 2032. Aegis, the equivalent software at Europe’s NEOCC site, agreed. No bother. More observations would very likely remove 2024 YR4 from the Risk List. Just another day at the office for Farnocchia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that an asteroid heading toward Earth isn’t always a problem. Small rocks burn up in the planet’s atmosphere several times a day; you’ve probably seen one already this year, on a moonless night. But above a certain size, these rocks turn from innocuous shooting stars into nuclear-esque explosions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflected starlight is great for initially spotting asteroids, but it’s a terrible way to determine how big they are. A large, dull rock reflects as much light as a bright, tiny rock, making them appear the same to many telescopes. And that’s a problem, considering that a rock around 30 feet long will explode loudly but inconsequentially in Earth’s atmosphere, while a 3,000-foot-long asteroid would slam into the ground and cause devastation on a global scale, imperiling all of civilization. Roughly speaking, if you double the size of an asteroid, it becomes eight times more energetic upon impact—so finding out the size of an Earthbound asteroid is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In those first few hours after it was discovered, and before anyone knew how shiny or dull its surface was, 2024 YR4 was estimated by astronomers to be as small as 65 feet across or as large as 500 feet. An object of the former size would blow up in mid-air, shattering windows over many miles and likely injuring thousands of people. At the latter size it would vaporize the heart of any city it struck, turning solid rock and metal into liquid and vapor, while its blast wave would devastate the rest of it, killing hundreds of thousands or even millions in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now the question was: Just how big &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; 2024 YR4?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;REFINING THE PICTURE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understandably dissatisfied with that level of imprecision, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), high up on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile’s Atacama Desert, entered the chat. As the name suggests, this flagship facility is vast, and it’s capable of really zooming in on distant objects. Or to put it another way: “The VLT is the largest, biggest, best telescope in the world,” says Hainaut, one of the facility’s operators, who usually commands it from half a world away in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reality, the VLT—which lends a hand to the European Space Agency in its asteroid-hunting duties—is actually made up of four massive telescopes, each fixed on four separate corners of the sky. They can be combined to act as a huge light bucket, allowing astronomers to see very faint asteroids. Four additional, smaller, movable telescopes can also team up with their bigger siblings to provide remarkably high-resolution images of even the stealthiest space rocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YR4-2.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much tech to oversee, the control room of the VLT looks a bit like the inside of the Death Star. “You have eight consoles, each of them with a dozen screens. It’s big, it’s large, it’s spectacular,” says Hainaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-January, the European Space Agency asked the VLT to study several asteroids that had somewhat suspicious near-Earth orbits—including 2024 YR4. With just a few lines of code, the VLT could easily train its sharp eyes on an asteroid like 2024 YR4, allowing astronomers to narrow down its size range. It was found to be at least 130 feet long (big enough to cause major damage in a city) and as much as 300 feet (able to annihilate one).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 29, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marco Fenucci" class="wp-image-1119830" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fenucci-marco.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the month, there was no mistaking it: 2024 YR4 stood a greater than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you see very often,” says Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at NEOCC. He admits that although it was “a serious thing,” this escalation was also “exciting to see”—something straight out of a sci-fi flick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sentry and Aegis, along with the systems at NEODyS, had been checking one another’s calculations. “There was a lot of care,” says Farnocchia, who explains that even though their programs worked wonders, their predictions were manually verified by multiple experts. When a rarity like 2024 YR4 comes along, he says, “you kind of switch gears, and you start being more cautious. You start screening everything that comes in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the klaxon emanating from these three data centers pushed the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a UN-backed planetary defense awareness group, to issue a public alert to the world’s governments: &lt;em&gt;The planet may be in peril.&lt;/em&gt; For the most part, it was at this moment that the media—and the wider public—became aware of the threat. Earth, we may have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau, along with plenty of other astronomers, received an urgent email from Fast at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office, requesting that all capable observatories track this hazardous asteroid. But there was one glaring problem. When 2024 YR4 was discovered on December 27, it was already two days after it had made its closest approach to Earth. And since it was heading back out into the shadows of space, it was quickly fading from sight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it gets too faint, “there’s not much ATLAS can do,” Denneau says. By the time of IAWN’s warning, planetary defenders had just weeks to try to track 2024 YR4 and refine the odds of its hitting Earth before they’d lose it to the darkness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if their scopes failed, the odds of an Earth impact would have stayed uncomfortably high until 2028, when the asteroid was due to make another flyby of the planet. That’d be just four short years before the space rock might actually hit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“In that situation, we would have been … in trouble,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The hunt was on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;PREPARING FOR THE WORST&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 5 and February 6, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE MISSION PLANNING ADVISORY GROUP, AUSTRIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early February, spaceflight mission specialists, including those at the UN-supported Space Mission Planning Advisory Group in Vienna, began high-level talks designed to sketch out ways in which 2024 YR4 could be either deflected away from Earth or obliterated—you know, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A range of options were available—including ramming it with several uncrewed spacecraft or assaulting it with nuclear weapons—but there was no silver bullet in this situation. Nobody had ever launched a nuclear explosive device into deep space before, and the geopolitical ramifications of any nuclear-armed nations doing so in the present day would prove deeply unwelcome. Asteroids are also extremely odd objects; some, perhaps including 2024 YR4, are less like single chunks of rock and more akin to multiple cliffs flying in formation. Hit an asteroid like that too hard and you could fail to deflect it—and instead turn an Earthbound cannonball into a spray of shotgun pellets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that early on, experts were concerned about whether they could prevent a potential disaster. Crucially, eight years was not actually much time to plan something of this scale. So they were keen to better pinpoint how likely, or unlikely, it was that 2024 YR4 was going to collide with the planet before any complex space mission planning began in earnest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people involved with these talks—from physicists at some of America’s most secretive nuclear weapons research laboratories to spaceflight researchers over in Europe—were not feeling close to anything resembling panic. But “the timeline was really short,” admits Hainaut. So there was an unprecedented tempo to their discussions. This wasn’t a drill. This was the real deal. What would they do to defend the planet if an asteroid impact couldn’t be ruled out?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, over the next few days, a handful of new observations came in. Each helped Sentry, Aegis, and the system at NEODyS rule out more of 2024 YR4’s possible future orbits. Unluckily, Earth remained a potential port of call for this pesky asteroid—and over time, our planet made up a higher proportion of those remaining possibilities. That meant that the odds of an Earth impact “started bubbling up,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a telescope in each of the four corners points to an asteroid" class="wp-image-1119775" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Redamonti_asteroid_7.2.25.jpg?w=1903" width="1903" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;EVA REDAMONTI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By February 6, they jumped to 2.3%—a one-in-43 chance of an impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“How much anxiety someone should feel over that—it’s hard to say,” Denneau says, with a slight shrug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, several elephantine asteroids have been found to stand a small chance of careening unceremoniously into the planet. Such incidents tend to follow a pattern. As more observations come in and the asteroid’s orbit becomes better known, an Earth impact trajectory remains a possibility while other outlying orbits are removed from the calculations—so for a time, the odds of an impact rise. Finally, with enough observations in hand, it becomes clear that the space rock will miss our world entirely, and the impact odds plummet to zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers expected this to repeat itself with 2024 YR4. But there was no guarantee. There’s no escaping the fact that one day, sooner or later, scientists will discover a dangerous asteroid that will punch Earth in the face—and raze a city in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, asteroids capable of trashing a city have found their way to Earth plenty of times before, and not just in the very distant past. In 1908, an 800-square-mile patch of forest in Siberia—one that was, fortunately, very sparsely populated—was decimated by a space rock just 180 feet long. It didn’t even hit the ground; it exploded in midair with the force of a 15-megaton blast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But only one other asteroid comparable in size to 2024 YR4 had its 2.3% figure beat: in 2004, Apophis—capable of causing continental-scale damage—had (briefly) stood a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapidly approaching uncharted waters, the powers that be at NASA decided to play a space-based wild card: the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A large dull asteroid reflects the same amount of light as a small shiny one, but that doesn’t mean astronomers sizing up an asteroid are helpless. If you view both asteroids in the infrared, the larger one glows brighter than the smaller one no matter the surface coating—making infrared, or the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum, a much better gauge of a space rock’s proportions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Observatories on Earth do have infrared capabilities, but our planet’s atmosphere gets in their way, making it hard for them to offer highly accurate readings of an asteroid’s size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), hanging out in space, doesn’t have that problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A collage of three images showing the black expanse of space. Two-thirds of the collage is taken up by the black background sprinkled with small, blurry galaxies in orange, blue, and white. There are two images in a column at the right side of the collage.

Observations were taken using both its NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to study the thermal properties of the asteroid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA, ESA, CSA, A. RIVKIN (APL), A. PAGAN (STSCI)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This observatory, which sits at a gravitationally stable point about a million miles from Earth, is polymathic. Its sniper-like scope can see in the infrared and allows it to peer at the edge of the observable universe, meaning it can study galaxies that formed not long after the Big Bang. It can even look at the light passing through the atmospheres of distant planets to ascertain their chemical makeups. And its remarkably sharp eye means it can also track the thermal glow of an asteroid long after all ground-based telescopes lose sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a fortuitous bit of timing, by the moment 2024 YR4 came along, planetary defenders had recently reasoned that JWST could theoretically be used to track ominous asteroids using its own infrared scope, should the need arise. So after IAWN’s warning went out, operators of JWST ran an analysis: Though the asteroid would vanish from most scopes by late March, this one might be able to see the rock until sometime in May, which would allow researchers to greatly refine their assessment of the asteroid’s orbit and its odds of making Earth impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understanding 2024 YR4’s trajectory was important, but “the size was the main motivator,” says Andy Rivkin, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the&amp;nbsp;proposal&amp;nbsp;to use JWST to observe the asteroid. The hope was that even if the impact odds remained high until 2028, JWST would find that 2024 YR4 was on the smaller side of the 130-to-300-feet size range—meaning it would still be a danger, but a far less catastrophic one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JWST proposal was accepted by NASA on February 5. But the earliest it could conduct its observations was early March. And time really wasn’t on Earth’s side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 7, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GEMINI SOUTH TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At this point, [2024 YR4] was too faint for the Catalina telescopes,” says Catalina’s Wierzchoś. “In our opinion, this was a big deal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Wierzchoś and his colleagues put in a rare emergency request to commandeer the Gemini Observatory, an internationally funded and run facility featuring two large, eagle-eyed telescopes—one in Chile and one atop Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano. Their request was granted, and on February 7, they trained the Chile-based Gemini South telescope onto 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119781" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gemini_South_Captures_Asteroid_2024_YR4_noirlab2514a.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This composite image  was captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS), by a team of astronomers. The hazy dot at the center is asteroid 2024 YR4.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of Earth impact dropped ever so slightly, to 2.2% —a minor, but still welcome, development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By this point, the roster of 2024 YR4 hunters also included the tiny team operating the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), which sits atop a tranquil mountain in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s myself and my husband,” says Eileen Ryan, the MRO director. “We’re the only two astronomers running the telescope. We have a daytime technician. It’s kind of a mom-and-pop organization.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the scope shouldn’t be underestimated. “We can see maybe a cell-phone-size object that’s illuminated at geosynchronous orbit,” Ryan says, referring to objects 22,000 miles away. But its most impressive feature is its mobility. While other observatories have slowly swiveling telescopes, MRO’s scope can move like the wind. “We can track the fastest objects,” she says, with a grin—noting that the telescope was built in part to watch missiles for the US Air Force. Its agility and long-distance vision explain why the Space Force is one of MRO’s major clients: It can be used to spy on satellites and spacecraft anywhere from low Earth orbit right out to the lunar regions. And that meant spying on the super-speedy, super-sneaky 2024 YR4 wasn’t a problem for MRO, whose own observations were vital in refining the asteroid’s impact odds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Eileen Ryan" class="wp-image-1119831" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ryan-eileen.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Eileen Ryan, the director of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in mid-February, MRO and all ground-based observatories came up against an unsolvable problem: The full moon was out, shining so brightly that it blinded any telescope that dared point at the night sky. “During the full moon, the observatories couldn’t observe for a week or so,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci. To most of us, the moon is a beautiful silvery orb. But to astronomers, it’s a hostile actor. “We abhor the moon,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All any of them could do was wait. Those tracking 2024 YR4 vacillated between being animated and slightly trepidatious. The thought that the asteroid could still stand a decent chance of impacting Earth after it faded from view did weigh a little on their minds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Farnocchia maintained his characteristic sangfroid throughout. “I try to stress about the things I can control,” he says. “All we can do is to explain what the situation is, and that we need new data to say more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the full moon finally faded into a crescent of light, the world’s largest telescopes sprang back into action for one last shot at glory. “The dark time came again,” says Hainaut, with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;New observations finally began to trickle in, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS readjusted their forecasts. It wasn’t great news: The odds of an Earth impact in 2032 jumped up to 3.1%, officially making 2024 YR4 the most dangerous asteroid ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This declaration made headlines across the world—and certainly made the curious public sit up and wonder if they had yet another apocalyptic concern to fret about. But, as ever, the asteroid hunters held fast in their prediction that sooner or later—ideally sooner—more observations would cause those impact odds to drop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We kept at it,” says Ryan. But time was running short; they started to “search for out-of-the-box ways to image this asteroid,” says Fenucci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defense researchers soon realized that 2024 YR4 wasn’t too far away from NASA’s Lucy spacecraft, a planetary science mission making a series of flybys of various asteroids. If Lucy could be redirected to catch up to 2024 YR4 instead, it would give humanity its best look at the rock, allowing Sentry and company to confirm or dispel our worst fears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, NASA ran the numbers, and it proved to be a nonstarter: 2024 YR4 was too speedy and too far for Lucy to pursue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was really starting to look as if JWST would be the last, best hope to track 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CHANGE OF FATE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 19, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE and MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just one day after 2024 YR made history, the VLT, MRO, and others caught sight of it again, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS voraciously consumed their new data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of an Earth impact suddenly dropped to 1.5%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers didn’t really have time to react to the possibility that this was a good sign—they just kept sending their observations onward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 20, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUBARU TELESCOPE, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet another observatory had been itching to get into the game for weeks, but it wasn’t until February 20 that Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, sitting atop Mauna Kea, finally caught 2024 YR4 shifting between the stars. He added his data to the stream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden, the asteroid lost its lethal luster. The odds of its hitting Earth were now just 0.3%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, you might expect that all those tracking it would be in a single control room somewhere, eyes glued to their screens, watching the odds drop before bursting into cheers and rapturous applause. But no—the astronomers who had spent so long observing this asteroid remained scattered across the globe. And instead of erupting into cheers, they exchanged modestly worded emails of congratulations—the digital equivalent of a nod or a handshake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Tsuyoshi Tera at a workstation with many monitors" class="wp-image-1119786" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20200715-subaru-fig-full_Terai.jpg?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In late February, data from Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, which sits atop Mauna Kea, confirmed that 2024 YR4 was not so lethal after all.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a relief,” says Terai. “I was very pleased that our data contributed to put an end to the risk of 2024 YR4.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 24, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few days later, and thanks to a litany of observations continuing to flood in, IAWN issued the all-clear. This once-ominous asteroid’s odds of inconveniencing our planet were at 0.004%—one in 25,000. Today, the odds of an Earth impact in 2032 are exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was kinda fun while it lasted,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defenders may have had a blast defending the world, but these astronomers still took the cosmic threat deeply seriously—and never once took their eyes off the prize. “In my mind, the observers and orbit teams were the stars of this story,” says Fast, NASA’s acting planetary defense officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Farnocchia shrugs off the entire thing. “It was the expected outcome,” he says. “We just didn’t know when that would happen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on it now, though, some 2024 YR4 trackers are allowing themselves to dwell on just how close this asteroid came to being a major danger. “It’s wild to watch it all play out,” says Denneau. “We were weeks away from having to spin up some serious mitigation planning.” But there was no need to work out how the save the world. It turned out that 2024 YR4 was never a threat to begin with—it just took a while to check.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And these experiences in handling a dicey space rock will only serve to make the world a safer place to live. One day, an asteroid very much like 2024 YR4 will be seen heading straight for Earth. And those tasked with tracking it will be officially battle-tested, and better prepared than ever to do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A POSTSCRIPT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the story of 2024 YR4 is not quite over—in fact, if this were a movie, it would have an after-credits scene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the Earth-impact odds fell off a cliff, JWST went ahead with its observations in March anyway. It found out that 2024 YR4 was 200 feet across—so large that a direct strike on a city would have proved horrifically lethal. Earth just didn’t have to worry about it anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the moon might. Thanks in part to JWST, astronomers calculated a 3.8% chance that 2024 YR4 will impact the lunar surface in 2032. Additional JWST observations in May bumped those odds up slightly, to 4.3%, and the orbit can no longer be refined until the asteroid’s next Earth flyby in 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It may hit the moon!” says Denneau. “Everybody’s still very excited about that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lunar collision would give astronomers a wonderful opportunity not only to study the physics of an asteroid impact, but also to demonstrate to the public just how good they are at precisely predicting the future motions of potentially lethal space rocks. “It’s a thing we can plan for without having to defend the Earth,” says Denneau.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If 2024 YR4 is truly going to smash into the moon, the impact—likely on the side facing Earth—would unleash an explosion equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. An expansive crater would be carved out in the blink of an eye, and a shower of debris would erupt in all directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this supersonic wreckage would pose any danger to Earth, but it would look spectacular: You’d be able to see the bright flash of the impact from terra firma with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If that does happen, it’ll be amazing,” says Denneau. It will be a spectacular way to see the saga of 2024 YR4—once a mere speck on his computer screen—come to an explosive end, from a front-row seat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

Despite their vastly different appetites for energy and data, large language models and human brains do share a good deal in common. They’re both made up of millions of subcomponents: biological neurons in the case of the brain, simulated “neurons” in the case of networks.

It’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology. Last week, the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. Both studies propose that these trained networks could help scientists advance their understanding of the human mind. But predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one of the studies, researchers transformed a large language model into what they refer to as a “foundation model of human cognition.” Out of the box, large language models aren’t great at mimicking human behavior—they behave logically in settings where humans abandon reason, such as casinos. So the researchers fine-tuned Llama 3.1, one of Meta’s open-source LLMs, on data from a range of 160 psychology experiments, which involved tasks like choosing from a set of “slot machines” to get the maximum payout or remembering sequences of letters. They called the resulting model Centaur.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with conventional psychological models, which use simple math equations, Centaur did a far better job of predicting behavior. Accurate predictions of how humans respond in psychology experiments are valuable in and of themselves: For example, scientists could use Centaur to pilot their experiments on a computer before recruiting, and paying, human participants. In their paper, however, the researchers propose that Centaur could be more than just a prediction machine. By interrogating the mechanisms that allow Centaur to effectively replicate human behavior, they argue, scientists could develop new theories about the inner workings of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But some psychologists doubt whether Centaur can tell us much about the mind at all.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, it’s better than conventional psychological models at predicting how humans behave—but it also has a billion times more parameters. And just because a model behaves like a human on the outside doesn’t mean that it functions like one on the inside. Olivia Guest, an assistant professor of computational cognitive science at Radboud University in the Netherlands, compares Centaur to a calculator, which can effectively predict the response a math whiz will give when asked to add two numbers. “I don’t know what you would learn about human addition by studying a calculator,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even if Centaur does capture something important about human psychology, scientists may struggle to extract any insight from the model’s millions of neurons. Though AI researchers are working hard to figure out how large language models work, they’ve barely managed to crack open the black box. Understanding an enormous neural-network model of the human mind may not prove much easier than understanding the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One alternative approach is to go small. &lt;/strong&gt;The second of the two &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; studies focuses on minuscule neural networks—some containing only a single neuron—that nevertheless can predict behavior in mice, rats, monkeys, and even humans. Because the networks are so small, it’s possible to track the activity of each individual neuron and use that data to figure out how the network is producing its behavioral predictions. And while there’s no guarantee that these models function like the brains they were trained to mimic, they can, at the very least, generate testable hypotheses about human and animal cognition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a cost to comprehensibility. Unlike Centaur, which was trained to mimic human behavior in dozens of different tasks, each tiny network can only predict behavior in one specific task. One network, for example, is specialized for making predictions about how people choose among different slot machines. “If the behavior is really complex, you need a large network,” says Marcelo Mattar, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who led the tiny-network study and also contributed to Centaur. “The compromise, of course, is that now understanding it is very, very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This trade-off between prediction and understanding is a key feature of neural-network-driven science. &lt;/strong&gt;(I also happen to be writing a book about it.) Studies like Mattar’s are making some progress toward closing that gap—as tiny as his networks are, they can predict behavior more accurately than traditional psychological models. So is the research into LLM interpretability happening at places like Anthropic.

Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors. But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants. Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and are home to many of the world’s pioneering private fusion efforts. The West has consequently developed many of the basic technologies that will make fusion power work. But in the past five years China’s support of fusion energy has surged, threatening to allow the country to dominate the industry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The industrial base available to support China’s nascent fusion energy industry could enable it to climb the learning curve much faster and more effectively than the West. Commercialization requires know-how, capabilities, and complementary assets, including supply chains and workforces in adjacent industries. And especially in comparison with China, the US and Europe have significantly under-supported the industrial assets needed for a fusion industry, such as thin-film processing and power electronics.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To compete, the US, allies, and partners must invest more heavily not only in fusion itself—which is already happening—but also in those adjacent technologies that are critical to the fusion industrial base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China’s trajectory to dominating fusion and the West’s potential route to competing can be understood by looking at today’s most promising scientific and engineering pathway to achieve grid-relevant fusion energy. That pathway relies on the tokamak, a technology that uses a magnetic field to confine ionized gas—called plasma—and ultimately fuse nuclei. This process releases energy that is converted from heat to electricity. Tokamaks consist of several critical systems, including plasma confinement and heating, fuel production and processing, blankets and heat flux management, and power conversion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A close look at the adjacent industries needed to build these critical systems clearly shows China’s advantage while also providing a glimpse into the challenges of building a fusion industrial base in the US or Europe. China has leadership in three of these six key industries, and the West is at risk of losing leadership in two more. China’s industrial might in thin-film processing, large metal-alloy structures, and power electronics provides a strong foundation to establish the upstream supply chain for fusion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The importance of thin-film processing is evident in the plasma confinement system. Tokamaks use strong electromagnets to keep the fusion plasma in place, and the magnetic coils must be made from superconducting materials. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconductors are the highest-performing materials available in sufficient quantity to be viable for use in fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The REBCO industry, which relies on thin-film processing technologies, currently has low production volumes spanning globally distributed manufacturers. However, as the fusion industry grows, the manufacturing base for REBCO will likely consolidate among the industry players who are able to rapidly take advantage of economies of scale. China is today’s world leader in thin-film, high-volume manufacturing for solar panels and flat-panel displays, with the associated expert workforce, tooling sector, infrastructure, and upstream materials supply chain. Without significant attention and investment on the part of the West, China is well positioned to dominate REBCO thin-film processing for fusion magnets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in a full-scale tokamak are as tall as a three-story building. Structures made using strong metal alloys are needed to hold these electromagnets around the large vacuum vessel that physically contains the magnetically confined plasma. Similar large-scale, complex metal structures are required for shipbuilding, aerospace, oil and gas infrastructure, and turbines. But fusion plants will require new versions of the alloys that are radiation-tolerant, able to withstand cryogenic temperatures, and corrosion-resistant. China’s manufacturing capacity and its metallurgical research efforts position it well to outcompete other global suppliers in making the necessary specialty metal alloys and machining them into the complex structures needed for fusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A tokamak also requires large-scale power electronics. Here again China dominates. Similar systems are found in the high-speed rail (HSR) industry, renewable microgrids, and arc furnaces. As of 2024, China had deployed over 48,000 kilometers of HSR. That is three times the length of Europe’s HSR network and 55 times as long as the Acela network in the US, which is slower than HSR. While other nations have a presence, China’s expertise is more recent and is being applied on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But this is not the end of the story. The West still has an opportunity to lead the other three adjacent industries important to the fusion supply chain: cryo-plants, fuel processing, and blankets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in an operational tokamak need to be kept at cryogenic temperatures of around 20 Kelvin to remain superconducting. This requires large-scale, multi-megawatt cryogenic cooling plants. Here, the country best set up to lead the industry is less clear. The two major global suppliers of cryo-plants are Europe-based Linde Engineering and Air Liquide Engineering; the US has Air Products and Chemicals and Chart Industries. But they are not alone: China’s domestic champions in the cryogenic sector include Hangyang Group, SASPG, Kaifeng Air Separation, and SOPC. Each of these regions already has an industrial base that could scale up to meet the demands of fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fuel production for fusion is a nascent part of the industrial base requiring processing technologies for light-isotope gases—hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium. Some processing of light-isotope gases is already done at small scale in medicine, hydrogen weapons production, and scientific research in the US, Europe, and China. But the scale needed for the fusion industry does not exist in today’s industrial base, presenting a major opportunity to develop the needed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Similarly, blankets and heat flux management are an opportunity for the West. The blanket is the medium used to absorb energy from the fusion reaction and to breed tritium. Commercial-scale blankets will require entirely novel technology. To date, no adjacent industries have relevant commercial expertise in liquid lithium, lead-lithium eutectic, or fusion-specific molten salts that are required for blanket technology. Some overlapping blanket technologies are in early-stage development by the nuclear fission industry. As the largest producer of beryllium in the world, the US has an opportunity to capture leadership because that element is a key material in leading fusion blanket concepts. But the use of beryllium must be coupled with technology development programs for the other specialty blanket components.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These six industries will prove critical to scaling fusion energy. In some, such as thin-film processing and large metal-alloy structures, China already has a sizable advantage. Crucially, China recognizes the importance of these adjacent industries and is actively harnessing them in its fusion efforts. For example, China launched a fusion consortium that consists of industrial giants spanning the steel, machine tooling, electric grid, power generation, and aerospace sectors. It will be extremely difficult for the West to catch up in these areas, but policymakers and business leaders must pay attention and try to create robust alternative supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the industrial area of greatest strength, cryo-plants could continue to be an opportunity for leadership in the West. Bolstering Western cryo-plant production by creating demand for natural-gas liquefaction will be a major boon to the future cryo-plant supply chain that will support fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and European countries also have an opportunity to lead in the emerging industrial areas of fuel processing and blanket technologies. Doing so will require policymakers to work with companies to ensure that public and private funding is allocated to these critical emerging supply chains. Governments may well need to serve as early customers and provide debt financing for significant capital investment. Governments can also do better to incentivize private capital and equity financing—for example, through favorable capital-gains taxation. In lagging areas of thin-film and alloy production, the US and Europe will likely need partners, such as South Korea and Japan, that have the industrial bases to compete globally with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to connect and capitalize multiple industries and supply chains will require long-term thinking and clear leadership. A focus on the demand side of these complementary industries is essential. Fusion is a decade away from maturation, so its supplier base must be derisked and made profitable in the near term by focusing on other primary demand markets that contribute to our economic vitality. To name a few, policymakers can support modernization of the grid to bolster domestic demand for power electronics and domestic semiconductor manufacturing to support thin-film processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The West must also focus on the demand for energy production itself. As the world’s largest energy consumer, China will leverage demand from its massive domestic market to climb the learning curve and bolster national champions. This is a strategy that China has wielded with tremendous success to dominate global manufacturing, most recently in the electric-vehicle industry. Taken together, supply- and demand-side investment have been a winning strategy for China.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The competition to lead the future of fusion energy is here. Now is the moment for the US and its Western allies to start investing in the foundational innovation ecosystem needed for a vibrant and resilient industrial base to support it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel F.

Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors. But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants. Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and are home to many of the world’s pioneering private fusion efforts. The West has consequently developed many of the basic technologies that will make fusion power work. But in the past five years China’s support of fusion energy has surged, threatening to allow the country to dominate the industry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The industrial base available to support China’s nascent fusion energy industry could enable it to climb the learning curve much faster and more effectively than the West. Commercialization requires know-how, capabilities, and complementary assets, including supply chains and workforces in adjacent industries. And especially in comparison with China, the US and Europe have significantly under-supported the industrial assets needed for a fusion industry, such as thin-film processing and power electronics.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To compete, the US, allies, and partners must invest more heavily not only in fusion itself—which is already happening—but also in those adjacent technologies that are critical to the fusion industrial base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China’s trajectory to dominating fusion and the West’s potential route to competing can be understood by looking at today’s most promising scientific and engineering pathway to achieve grid-relevant fusion energy. That pathway relies on the tokamak, a technology that uses a magnetic field to confine ionized gas—called plasma—and ultimately fuse nuclei. This process releases energy that is converted from heat to electricity. Tokamaks consist of several critical systems, including plasma confinement and heating, fuel production and processing, blankets and heat flux management, and power conversion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A close look at the adjacent industries needed to build these critical systems clearly shows China’s advantage while also providing a glimpse into the challenges of building a fusion industrial base in the US or Europe. China has leadership in three of these six key industries, and the West is at risk of losing leadership in two more. China’s industrial might in thin-film processing, large metal-alloy structures, and power electronics provides a strong foundation to establish the upstream supply chain for fusion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The importance of thin-film processing is evident in the plasma confinement system. Tokamaks use strong electromagnets to keep the fusion plasma in place, and the magnetic coils must be made from superconducting materials. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconductors are the highest-performing materials available in sufficient quantity to be viable for use in fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The REBCO industry, which relies on thin-film processing technologies, currently has low production volumes spanning globally distributed manufacturers. However, as the fusion industry grows, the manufacturing base for REBCO will likely consolidate among the industry players who are able to rapidly take advantage of economies of scale. China is today’s world leader in thin-film, high-volume manufacturing for solar panels and flat-panel displays, with the associated expert workforce, tooling sector, infrastructure, and upstream materials supply chain. Without significant attention and investment on the part of the West, China is well positioned to dominate REBCO thin-film processing for fusion magnets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in a full-scale tokamak are as tall as a three-story building. Structures made using strong metal alloys are needed to hold these electromagnets around the large vacuum vessel that physically contains the magnetically confined plasma. Similar large-scale, complex metal structures are required for shipbuilding, aerospace, oil and gas infrastructure, and turbines. But fusion plants will require new versions of the alloys that are radiation-tolerant, able to withstand cryogenic temperatures, and corrosion-resistant. China’s manufacturing capacity and its metallurgical research efforts position it well to outcompete other global suppliers in making the necessary specialty metal alloys and machining them into the complex structures needed for fusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A tokamak also requires large-scale power electronics. Here again China dominates. Similar systems are found in the high-speed rail (HSR) industry, renewable microgrids, and arc furnaces. As of 2024, China had deployed over 48,000 kilometers of HSR. That is three times the length of Europe’s HSR network and 55 times as long as the Acela network in the US, which is slower than HSR. While other nations have a presence, China’s expertise is more recent and is being applied on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But this is not the end of the story. The West still has an opportunity to lead the other three adjacent industries important to the fusion supply chain: cryo-plants, fuel processing, and blankets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in an operational tokamak need to be kept at cryogenic temperatures of around 20 Kelvin to remain superconducting. This requires large-scale, multi-megawatt cryogenic cooling plants. Here, the country best set up to lead the industry is less clear. The two major global suppliers of cryo-plants are Europe-based Linde Engineering and Air Liquide Engineering; the US has Air Products and Chemicals and Chart Industries. But they are not alone: China’s domestic champions in the cryogenic sector include Hangyang Group, SASPG, Kaifeng Air Separation, and SOPC. Each of these regions already has an industrial base that could scale up to meet the demands of fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fuel production for fusion is a nascent part of the industrial base requiring processing technologies for light-isotope gases—hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium. Some processing of light-isotope gases is already done at small scale in medicine, hydrogen weapons production, and scientific research in the US, Europe, and China. But the scale needed for the fusion industry does not exist in today’s industrial base, presenting a major opportunity to develop the needed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Similarly, blankets and heat flux management are an opportunity for the West. The blanket is the medium used to absorb energy from the fusion reaction and to breed tritium. Commercial-scale blankets will require entirely novel technology. To date, no adjacent industries have relevant commercial expertise in liquid lithium, lead-lithium eutectic, or fusion-specific molten salts that are required for blanket technology. Some overlapping blanket technologies are in early-stage development by the nuclear fission industry. As the largest producer of beryllium in the world, the US has an opportunity to capture leadership because that element is a key material in leading fusion blanket concepts. But the use of beryllium must be coupled with technology development programs for the other specialty blanket components.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These six industries will prove critical to scaling fusion energy. In some, such as thin-film processing and large metal-alloy structures, China already has a sizable advantage. Crucially, China recognizes the importance of these adjacent industries and is actively harnessing them in its fusion efforts. For example, China launched a fusion consortium that consists of industrial giants spanning the steel, machine tooling, electric grid, power generation, and aerospace sectors. It will be extremely difficult for the West to catch up in these areas, but policymakers and business leaders must pay attention and try to create robust alternative supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the industrial area of greatest strength, cryo-plants could continue to be an opportunity for leadership in the West. Bolstering Western cryo-plant production by creating demand for natural-gas liquefaction will be a major boon to the future cryo-plant supply chain that will support fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and European countries also have an opportunity to lead in the emerging industrial areas of fuel processing and blanket technologies. Doing so will require policymakers to work with companies to ensure that public and private funding is allocated to these critical emerging supply chains. Governments may well need to serve as early customers and provide debt financing for significant capital investment. Governments can also do better to incentivize private capital and equity financing—for example, through favorable capital-gains taxation. In lagging areas of thin-film and alloy production, the US and Europe will likely need partners, such as South Korea and Japan, that have the industrial bases to compete globally with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to connect and capitalize multiple industries and supply chains will require long-term thinking and clear leadership. A focus on the demand side of these complementary industries is essential. Fusion is a decade away from maturation, so its supplier base must be derisked and made profitable in the near term by focusing on other primary demand markets that contribute to our economic vitality. To name a few, policymakers can support modernization of the grid to bolster domestic demand for power electronics and domestic semiconductor manufacturing to support thin-film processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The West must also focus on the demand for energy production itself. As the world’s largest energy consumer, China will leverage demand from its massive domestic market to climb the learning curve and bolster national champions. This is a strategy that China has wielded with tremendous success to dominate global manufacturing, most recently in the electric-vehicle industry. Taken together, supply- and demand-side investment have been a winning strategy for China.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The competition to lead the future of fusion energy is here. Now is the moment for the US and its Western allies to start investing in the foundational innovation ecosystem needed for a vibrant and resilient industrial base to support it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel F.

 &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI landscape is defined by the ways in which neural networks are unlike human brains. A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite that, it’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the prestigious journal Nature published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. However, predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.

Earth would be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how a sprawling network of astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Robin George Andrews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is part of the Big Story series: &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s most important, ambitious reporting.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How scientists are trying to use AI to unlock the human mind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI landscape is defined by the ways in which neural networks are unlike human brains. A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite that, it’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the prestigious journal Nature published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. However, predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.

Brunner, Edlyn V. Levine, Fiona E. Murray, &amp;amp; Rory Burke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Fusion energy holds the potential to shift a geopolitical landscape that is currently configured around fossil fuels. Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.

In 2013, the columnist Adrian Wooldridge coined a word that eventually did both. Writing for the Economist, he warned of the coming “techlash,” a revolt against Silicon Valley’s rich and powerful, fueled by the public’s growing realization that these “sovereigns of cyberspace” weren’t the benevolent bright-future bringers they claimed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wooldridge didn’t say precisely when this techlash would arrive, it’s clear today that a dramatic shift in public opinion toward Big Tech and its leaders did in fact ­happen—and is arguably still happening. It’s worth investigating why, and what we can do to start taking some of that power back.
