But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. For those following this developing story in the news, the revelation was unnerving. For many scientists and engineers, though, it turned out to be—despite its seriousness—a little bit exciting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While possible impact locations included patches of empty ocean, the space rock, called 2024 YR4, also had several densely populated cities in its possible crosshairs, including Mumbai, Lagos, and Bogotá. If the asteroid did in fact hit such a metropolis, the best-case scenario was severe damage; the worst case was outright, total ruin. And for the first time, a group of United Nations–backed researchers began to have high-level discussions about the fate of the world: If this asteroid was going to hit the planet, what sort of spaceflight mission might be able to stop it? Would they ram a spacecraft into it to deflect it? Would they use nuclear weapons to try to swat it away or obliterate it completely?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, planetary defenders all over the world crewed their battle stations to see if we could avoid that fate—and despite the sometimes taxing new demands on their psyches and schedules, they remained some of the coolest customers in the galaxy. “I’ve had to cancel an appointment saying, &lt;em&gt;I cannot come—I have to save the planet&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and one of those who tracked down 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then, just as quick as history was made, experts declared that the danger had passed. On February 24, asteroid trackers issued the all-clear: Earth would be spared, just as many planetary defense researchers had felt assured it would.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising (and rising and rising) danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how, over a span of just two months, a sprawling network of global astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed 2024 YR4, the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was not an exercise,” says Hainaut. This was the real thing: “We really [had] to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;IN THE BEGINNING&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 27, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ASTEROID TERRESTRIAL-IMPACT LAST ALERT SYSTEM, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long ago, an asteroid in the space-rock highway between Mars and Jupiter felt a disturbance in the force: the gravitational pull of Jupiter itself, king of the planets. After some wobbling back and forth, this asteroid was thrown out of the belt, skipped around the sun, and found itself on an orbit that overlapped with Earth’s own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was the first one to see the detections of it,” Larry Denneau, of the University of Hawai‘i, recalls. “A tiny white pixel on a black background.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denneau is one of the principal investigators at the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopic network. It may have been just two days after Christmas, but as usual, he followed procedure as if it were any other day of the year and sent the observations of the tiny pixel onward to another NASA-funded facility, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s an alternate reality in which none of this happened. Fortunately, in our timeline, various space agencies—chiefly NASA, but also the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—invest millions of dollars every year in asteroid-spotting efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And while multiple nations host observatories capable of performing this work, the US clearly leads the way: Its planetary defense program provides funding to a suite of telescopic facilities solely dedicated to identifying potentially hazardous space rocks. (At least, it leads the way for the moment. The White House’s proposal for draconian budget cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation mean that several observatories and space missions linked to planetary defense are facing funding losses or outright terminations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers working at these observatories are tasked with finding threatening asteroids before they find us—because you can’t fight what you can’t see. “They are the first line of planetary defense,” says Kelly Fast, the acting planetary defense officer at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;ATLAS is one part of this skywatching project, and it consists of four telescopes: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and another in South Africa. They don’t operate the way you’d think, with astronomers peering through them all night. Instead, they operate “completely robotically and automatically,” says Denneau. Driven by coding scripts that he and his colleagues have developed, these mechanical eyes work in harmony to watch out for any suspicious space rocks. Astronomers usually monitor their survey of the sky from a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ATLAS telescopes are small, so they can’t see particularly distant objects. But they have a wide field of view, allowing them to see large patches of space at any one moment. “As long as the weather is good, we’re constantly monitoring the night sky, from the North Pole to the South Pole,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Larry Denneau" class="wp-image-1119851" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/denneau-larry_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Larry Denneau, a principal investigator at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescopic network.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they detect the starlight reflecting off a moving object, an operator, such as Denneau, gets an alert and visually verifies that the object is real and not some sort of imaging artifact. When a suspected asteroid (or comet) is identified, the observations are sent to the MPC, which is home to a bulletin board featuring (among other things) orbital data on all known asteroids and comets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the object isn’t already listed, a new discovery is announced, and other astronomers can perform follow-up observations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In just the past few years, ATLAS has detected more than 1,200 asteroids with near-Earth orbits. Finding ultimately harmless space rocks is routine work—so much so that when the new near-Earth asteroid was spotted by ATLAS’s Chilean telescope that December day, it didn’t even raise any eyebrows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau had simply been sitting at home,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;doing some late-night work on his computer. At the time, of course, he didn’t know that his telescope had just spied what would soon become a history-making asteroid—one that could alter the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MPC quickly confirmed the new space rock hadn’t already been “found,” and astronomers gave it a provisional designation: 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CATALINA SKY SURVEY, ARIZONA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the discovery was shared with another NASA-funded facility: the Catalina Sky Survey, a nest of three telescopes in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson that works out of the University of Arizona. “We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of its comet and asteroid spotters. Unlike ATLAS, these telescopes (although aided by automation) often have an in-person astronomer available to quickly alter the surveys in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119794" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kacper_teleskop.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of the comet and asteroid spotters at the Catalina Sky Survey north of Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when Catalina was alerted about what its peers at ATLAS had spotted, staff deployed its Schmidt telescope—a smaller one that excels at seeing bright objects moving extremely quickly. As they fed their own observations of 2024 YR4 to the MPC, Catalina engineer David Rankin looked back over imagery from the previous days and found the new asteroid lurking in a night-sky image taken on December 26. Around then, ATLAS also realized that it had caught sight of 2024 YR4 in a photograph from December 25.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combined observations confirmed it: The asteroid had made its closest approach to Earth on Christmas Day, meaning it was already heading back out into space. But where, exactly, was this space rock going? Where would it end up after it swung around the sun?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to that question was Earth, Davide Farnocchia would be one of the first to know. You could say he’s one of NASA’s watchers on the wall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he’s remarkably calm about his duties. When he first heard about 2024 YR4, he barely flinched. It was just another asteroid drifting through space not terribly far from Earth. It was another box to be ticked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it was logged by the MPC, it was Farnocchia’s job to try to plot out 2024 YR4’s possible paths through space, checking to see if any of them overlapped with our planet’s. He works at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) in California, where he’s partly responsible for keeping track of all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system. “We have 1.4 million objects to deal with,” he says, matter-of-factly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, astronomers would have had to stitch together multiple images of this asteroid and plot out its possible trajectories. Today, fortunately, Farnocchia has some help: He oversees the digital brain Sentry, an autonomous system he helped code. (Two other facilities in Italy perform similar work: the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, or NEOCC, and the privately owned Near-Earth Objects Dynamics Site, or NEODyS.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To chart their courses, Sentry uses every new observation of every known asteroid or comet listed on the MPC to continuously refine the orbits of all those objects, using the immutable laws of gravity and the gravitational influences of any planets, moons, or other sizable asteroids they pass. A recent update to the software means that even the ever-so-gentle push afforded by sunlight is accounted for. That allows Sentry to confidently project the motions of all these objects at least a century into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Davide Farnocchia" class="wp-image-1119852" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/farnocchia-david_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Davide Farnocchia, who helps track all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost all newly discovered asteroids are quickly found to pose no impact risk. But those that stand even an infinitesimally small chance of smashing into our planet within the next 100 years are placed on the Sentry Risk List until additional observations can rule out those awful possibilities. Better safe than sorry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In late December, with just a limited set of data, Sentry concluded that there was a non-negligible chance 2024 YR4 would strike Earth in 2032. Aegis, the equivalent software at Europe’s NEOCC site, agreed. No bother. More observations would very likely remove 2024 YR4 from the Risk List. Just another day at the office for Farnocchia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that an asteroid heading toward Earth isn’t always a problem. Small rocks burn up in the planet’s atmosphere several times a day; you’ve probably seen one already this year, on a moonless night. But above a certain size, these rocks turn from innocuous shooting stars into nuclear-esque explosions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflected starlight is great for initially spotting asteroids, but it’s a terrible way to determine how big they are. A large, dull rock reflects as much light as a bright, tiny rock, making them appear the same to many telescopes. And that’s a problem, considering that a rock around 30 feet long will explode loudly but inconsequentially in Earth’s atmosphere, while a 3,000-foot-long asteroid would slam into the ground and cause devastation on a global scale, imperiling all of civilization. Roughly speaking, if you double the size of an asteroid, it becomes eight times more energetic upon impact—so finding out the size of an Earthbound asteroid is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In those first few hours after it was discovered, and before anyone knew how shiny or dull its surface was, 2024 YR4 was estimated by astronomers to be as small as 65 feet across or as large as 500 feet. An object of the former size would blow up in mid-air, shattering windows over many miles and likely injuring thousands of people. At the latter size it would vaporize the heart of any city it struck, turning solid rock and metal into liquid and vapor, while its blast wave would devastate the rest of it, killing hundreds of thousands or even millions in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now the question was: Just how big &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; 2024 YR4?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;REFINING THE PICTURE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understandably dissatisfied with that level of imprecision, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), high up on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile’s Atacama Desert, entered the chat. As the name suggests, this flagship facility is vast, and it’s capable of really zooming in on distant objects. Or to put it another way: “The VLT is the largest, biggest, best telescope in the world,” says Hainaut, one of the facility’s operators, who usually commands it from half a world away in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reality, the VLT—which lends a hand to the European Space Agency in its asteroid-hunting duties—is actually made up of four massive telescopes, each fixed on four separate corners of the sky. They can be combined to act as a huge light bucket, allowing astronomers to see very faint asteroids. Four additional, smaller, movable telescopes can also team up with their bigger siblings to provide remarkably high-resolution images of even the stealthiest space rocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YR4-2.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In this sequence of infrared images taken by ESO's VLT, the individual image frames have been aligned so that the asteroid remains in the center as other stars appear to move around it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="video-credit"&gt;ESO/O. HAINAUT ET AL.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much tech to oversee, the control room of the VLT looks a bit like the inside of the Death Star. “You have eight consoles, each of them with a dozen screens. It’s big, it’s large, it’s spectacular,” says Hainaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-January, the European Space Agency asked the VLT to study several asteroids that had somewhat suspicious near-Earth orbits—including 2024 YR4. With just a few lines of code, the VLT could easily train its sharp eyes on an asteroid like 2024 YR4, allowing astronomers to narrow down its size range. It was found to be at least 130 feet long (big enough to cause major damage in a city) and as much as 300 feet (able to annihilate one).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 29, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marco Fenucci" class="wp-image-1119854" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fenucci-marco_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the month, there was no mistaking it: 2024 YR4 stood a greater than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you see very often,” says Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at NEOCC. He admits that although it was “a serious thing,” this escalation was also “exciting to see”—something straight out of a sci-fi flick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sentry and Aegis, along with the systems at NEODyS, had been checking one another’s calculations. “There was a lot of care,” says Farnocchia, who explains that even though their programs worked wonders, their predictions were manually verified by multiple experts. When a rarity like 2024 YR4 comes along, he says, “you kind of switch gears, and you start being more cautious. You start screening everything that comes in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the klaxon emanating from these three data centers pushed the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a UN-backed planetary defense awareness group, to issue a public alert to the world’s governments: &lt;em&gt;The planet may be in peril.&lt;/em&gt; For the most part, it was at this moment that the media—and the wider public—became aware of the threat. Earth, we may have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau, along with plenty of other astronomers, received an urgent email from Fast at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office, requesting that all capable observatories track this hazardous asteroid. But there was one glaring problem. When 2024 YR4 was discovered on December 27, it was already two days after it had made its closest approach to Earth. And since it was heading back out into the shadows of space, it was quickly fading from sight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it gets too faint, “there’s not much ATLAS can do,” Denneau says. By the time of IAWN’s warning, planetary defenders had just weeks to try to track 2024 YR4 and refine the odds of its hitting Earth before they’d lose it to the darkness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if their scopes failed, the odds of an Earth impact would have stayed uncomfortably high until 2028, when the asteroid was due to make another flyby of the planet. That’d be just four short years before the space rock might actually hit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“In that situation, we would have been … in trouble,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The hunt was on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;PREPARING FOR THE WORST&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 5 and February 6, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE MISSION PLANNING ADVISORY GROUP, AUSTRIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early February, spaceflight mission specialists, including those at the UN-supported Space Mission Planning Advisory Group in Vienna, began high-level talks designed to sketch out ways in which 2024 YR4 could be either deflected away from Earth or obliterated—you know, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A range of options were available—including ramming it with several uncrewed spacecraft or assaulting it with nuclear weapons—but there was no silver bullet in this situation. Nobody had ever launched a nuclear explosive device into deep space before, and the geopolitical ramifications of any nuclear-armed nations doing so in the present day would prove deeply unwelcome. Asteroids are also extremely odd objects; some, perhaps including 2024 YR4, are less like single chunks of rock and more akin to multiple cliffs flying in formation. Hit an asteroid like that too hard and you could fail to deflect it—and instead turn an Earthbound cannonball into a spray of shotgun pellets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that early on, experts were concerned about whether they could prevent a potential disaster. Crucially, eight years was not actually much time to plan something of this scale. So they were keen to better pinpoint how likely, or unlikely, it was that 2024 YR4 was going to collide with the planet before any complex space mission planning began in earnest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people involved with these talks—from physicists at some of America’s most secretive nuclear weapons research laboratories to spaceflight researchers over in Europe—were not feeling close to anything resembling panic. But “the timeline was really short,” admits Hainaut. So there was an unprecedented tempo to their discussions. This wasn’t a drill. This was the real deal. What would they do to defend the planet if an asteroid impact couldn’t be ruled out?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, over the next few days, a handful of new observations came in. Each helped Sentry, Aegis, and the system at NEODyS rule out more of 2024 YR4’s possible future orbits. Unluckily, Earth remained a potential port of call for this pesky asteroid—and over time, our planet made up a higher proportion of those remaining possibilities. That meant that the odds of an Earth impact “started bubbling up,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a telescope in each of the four corners points to an asteroid" class="wp-image-1119775" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Redamonti_asteroid_7.2.25.jpg?w=1903" width="1903" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;EVA REDAMONTI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By February 6, they jumped to 2.3%—a one-in-43 chance of an impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“How much anxiety someone should feel over that—it’s hard to say,” Denneau says, with a slight shrug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, several elephantine asteroids have been found to stand a small chance of careening unceremoniously into the planet. Such incidents tend to follow a pattern. As more observations come in and the asteroid’s orbit becomes better known, an Earth impact trajectory remains a possibility while other outlying orbits are removed from the calculations—so for a time, the odds of an impact rise. Finally, with enough observations in hand, it becomes clear that the space rock will miss our world entirely, and the impact odds plummet to zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers expected this to repeat itself with 2024 YR4. But there was no guarantee. There’s no escaping the fact that one day, sooner or later, scientists will discover a dangerous asteroid that will punch Earth in the face—and raze a city in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, asteroids capable of trashing a city have found their way to Earth plenty of times before, and not just in the very distant past. In 1908, an 800-square-mile patch of forest in Siberia—one that was, fortunately, very sparsely populated—was decimated by a space rock just 180 feet long. It didn’t even hit the ground; it exploded in midair with the force of a 15-megaton blast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But only one other asteroid comparable in size to 2024 YR4 had its 2.3% figure beat: in 2004, Apophis—capable of causing continental-scale damage—had (briefly) stood a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapidly approaching uncharted waters, the powers that be at NASA decided to play a space-based wild card: the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A large dull asteroid reflects the same amount of light as a small shiny one, but that doesn’t mean astronomers sizing up an asteroid are helpless. If you view both asteroids in the infrared, the larger one glows brighter than the smaller one no matter the surface coating—making infrared, or the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum, a much better gauge of a space rock’s proportions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Observatories on Earth do have infrared capabilities, but our planet’s atmosphere gets in their way, making it hard for them to offer highly accurate readings of an asteroid’s size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), hanging out in space, doesn’t have that problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A collage of three images showing the black expanse of space. Two-thirds of the collage is taken up by the black background sprinkled with small, blurry galaxies in orange, blue, and white. There are two images in a column at the right side of the collage. On the right side of the main image, not far from the top, a very faint dot is outlined with a white square. At the right, there are two zoomed in views of this area.

Observations were taken using both its NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to study the thermal properties of the asteroid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA, ESA, CSA, A. RIVKIN (APL), A. PAGAN (STSCI)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This observatory, which sits at a gravitationally stable point about a million miles from Earth, is polymathic. Its sniper-like scope can see in the infrared and allows it to peer at the edge of the observable universe, meaning it can study galaxies that formed not long after the Big Bang. It can even look at the light passing through the atmospheres of distant planets to ascertain their chemical makeups. And its remarkably sharp eye means it can also track the thermal glow of an asteroid long after all ground-based telescopes lose sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a fortuitous bit of timing, by the moment 2024 YR4 came along, planetary defenders had recently reasoned that JWST could theoretically be used to track ominous asteroids using its own infrared scope, should the need arise. So after IAWN’s warning went out, operators of JWST ran an analysis: Though the asteroid would vanish from most scopes by late March, this one might be able to see the rock until sometime in May, which would allow researchers to greatly refine their assessment of the asteroid’s orbit and its odds of making Earth impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understanding 2024 YR4’s trajectory was important, but “the size was the main motivator,” says Andy Rivkin, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the&amp;nbsp;proposal&amp;nbsp;to use JWST to observe the asteroid. The hope was that even if the impact odds remained high until 2028, JWST would find that 2024 YR4 was on the smaller side of the 130-to-300-feet size range—meaning it would still be a danger, but a far less catastrophic one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JWST proposal was accepted by NASA on February 5. But the earliest it could conduct its observations was early March. And time really wasn’t on Earth’s side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 7, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GEMINI SOUTH TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At this point, [2024 YR4] was too faint for the Catalina telescopes,” says Catalina’s Wierzchoś. “In our opinion, this was a big deal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Wierzchoś and his colleagues put in a rare emergency request to commandeer the Gemini Observatory, an internationally funded and run facility featuring two large, eagle-eyed telescopes—one in Chile and one atop Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano. Their request was granted, and on February 7, they trained the Chile-based Gemini South telescope onto 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119781" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gemini_South_Captures_Asteroid_2024_YR4_noirlab2514a.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This composite image  was captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS), by a team of astronomers. The hazy dot at the center is asteroid 2024 YR4.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;INTERNATIONAL GEMINI OBSERVATORY/NOIRLAB/NSF/AURA/M. ZAMANI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The odds of Earth impact dropped ever so slightly, to 2.2% —a minor, but still welcome, development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By this point, the roster of 2024 YR4 hunters also included the tiny team operating the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), which sits atop a tranquil mountain in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s myself and my husband,” says Eileen Ryan, the MRO director. “We’re the only two astronomers running the telescope. We have a daytime technician. It’s kind of a mom-and-pop organization.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the scope shouldn’t be underestimated. “We can see maybe a cell-phone-size object that’s illuminated at geosynchronous orbit,” Ryan says, referring to objects 22,000 miles away. But its most impressive feature is its mobility. While other observatories have slowly swiveling telescopes, MRO’s scope can move like the wind. “We can track the fastest objects,” she says, with a grin—noting that the telescope was built in part to watch missiles for the US Air Force. Its agility and long-distance vision explain why the Space Force is one of MRO’s major clients: It can be used to spy on satellites and spacecraft anywhere from low Earth orbit right out to the lunar regions. And that meant spying on the super-speedy, super-sneaky 2024 YR4 wasn’t a problem for MRO, whose own observations were vital in refining the asteroid’s impact odds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Eileen Ryan" class="wp-image-1119855" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ryan-eileen_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Eileen Ryan, the director of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in mid-February, MRO and all ground-based observatories came up against an unsolvable problem: The full moon was out, shining so brightly that it blinded any telescope that dared point at the night sky. “During the full moon, the observatories couldn’t observe for a week or so,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci. To most of us, the moon is a beautiful silvery orb. But to astronomers, it’s a hostile actor. “We abhor the moon,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All any of them could do was wait. Those tracking 2024 YR4 vacillated between being animated and slightly trepidatious. The thought that the asteroid could still stand a decent chance of impacting Earth after it faded from view did weigh a little on their minds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Farnocchia maintained his characteristic sangfroid throughout. “I try to stress about the things I can control,” he says. “All we can do is to explain what the situation is, and that we need new data to say more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the full moon finally faded into a crescent of light, the world’s largest telescopes sprang back into action for one last shot at glory. “The dark time came again,” says Hainaut, with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;New observations finally began to trickle in, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS readjusted their forecasts. It wasn’t great news: The odds of an Earth impact in 2032 jumped up to 3.1%, officially making 2024 YR4 the most dangerous asteroid ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This declaration made headlines across the world—and certainly made the curious public sit up and wonder if they had yet another apocalyptic concern to fret about. But, as ever, the asteroid hunters held fast in their prediction that sooner or later—ideally sooner—more observations would cause those impact odds to drop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We kept at it,” says Ryan. But time was running short; they started to “search for out-of-the-box ways to image this asteroid,” says Fenucci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defense researchers soon realized that 2024 YR4 wasn’t too far away from NASA’s Lucy spacecraft, a planetary science mission making a series of flybys of various asteroids. If Lucy could be redirected to catch up to 2024 YR4 instead, it would give humanity its best look at the rock, allowing Sentry and company to confirm or dispel our worst fears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, NASA ran the numbers, and it proved to be a nonstarter: 2024 YR4 was too speedy and too far for Lucy to pursue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was really starting to look as if JWST would be the last, best hope to track 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CHANGE OF FATE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 19, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE and MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just one day after 2024 YR made history, the VLT, MRO, and others caught sight of it again, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS voraciously consumed their new data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of an Earth impact suddenly dropped to 1.5%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers didn’t really have time to react to the possibility that this was a good sign—they just kept sending their observations onward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 20, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUBARU TELESCOPE, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet another observatory had been itching to get into the game for weeks, but it wasn’t until February 20 that Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, sitting atop Mauna Kea, finally caught 2024 YR4 shifting between the stars. He added his data to the stream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden, the asteroid lost its lethal luster. The odds of its hitting Earth were now just 0.3%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, you might expect that all those tracking it would be in a single control room somewhere, eyes glued to their screens, watching the odds drop before bursting into cheers and rapturous applause. But no—the astronomers who had spent so long observing this asteroid remained scattered across the globe. And instead of erupting into cheers, they exchanged modestly worded emails of congratulations—the digital equivalent of a nod or a handshake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Tsuyoshi Tera at a workstation with many monitors" class="wp-image-1119786" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20200715-subaru-fig-full_Terai.jpg?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In late February, data from Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, which sits atop Mauna Kea, confirmed that 2024 YR4 was not so lethal after all.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a relief,” says Terai. “I was very pleased that our data contributed to put an end to the risk of 2024 YR4.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 24, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few days later, and thanks to a litany of observations continuing to flood in, IAWN issued the all-clear. This once-ominous asteroid’s odds of inconveniencing our planet were at 0.004%—one in 25,000. Today, the odds of an Earth impact in 2032 are exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was kinda fun while it lasted,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defenders may have had a blast defending the world, but these astronomers still took the cosmic threat deeply seriously—and never once took their eyes off the prize. “In my mind, the observers and orbit teams were the stars of this story,” says Fast, NASA’s acting planetary defense officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Farnocchia shrugs off the entire thing. “It was the expected outcome,” he says. “We just didn’t know when that would happen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on it now, though, some 2024 YR4 trackers are allowing themselves to dwell on just how close this asteroid came to being a major danger. “It’s wild to watch it all play out,” says Denneau. “We were weeks away from having to spin up some serious mitigation planning.” But there was no need to work out how the save the world. It turned out that 2024 YR4 was never a threat to begin with—it just took a while to check.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And these experiences in handling a dicey space rock will only serve to make the world a safer place to live. One day, an asteroid very much like 2024 YR4 will be seen heading straight for Earth. And those tasked with tracking it will be officially battle-tested, and better prepared than ever to do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A POSTSCRIPT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the story of 2024 YR4 is not quite over—in fact, if this were a movie, it would have an after-credits scene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the Earth-impact odds fell off a cliff, JWST went ahead with its observations in March anyway. It found out that 2024 YR4 was 200 feet across—so large that a direct strike on a city would have proved horrifically lethal. Earth just didn’t have to worry about it anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the moon might. Thanks in part to JWST, astronomers calculated a 3.8% chance that 2024 YR4 will impact the lunar surface in 2032. Additional JWST observations in May bumped those odds up slightly, to 4.3%, and the orbit can no longer be refined until the asteroid’s next Earth flyby in 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It may hit the moon!” says Denneau. “Everybody’s still very excited about that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lunar collision would give astronomers a wonderful opportunity not only to study the physics of an asteroid impact, but also to demonstrate to the public just how good they are at precisely predicting the future motions of potentially lethal space rocks. “It’s a thing we can plan for without having to defend the Earth,” says Denneau.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If 2024 YR4 is truly going to smash into the moon, the impact—likely on the side facing Earth—would unleash an explosion equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. An expansive crater would be carved out in the blink of an eye, and a shower of debris would erupt in all directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this supersonic wreckage would pose any danger to Earth, but it would look spectacular: You’d be able to see the bright flash of the impact from terra firma with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If that does happen, it’ll be amazing,” says Denneau. It will be a spectacular way to see the saga of 2024 YR4—once a mere speck on his computer screen—come to an explosive end, from a front-row seat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. For those following this developing story in the news, the revelation was unnerving. For many scientists and engineers, though, it turned out to be—despite its seriousness—a little bit exciting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While possible impact locations included patches of empty ocean, the space rock, called 2024 YR4, also had several densely populated cities in its possible crosshairs, including Mumbai, Lagos, and Bogotá. If the asteroid did in fact hit such a metropolis, the best-case scenario was severe damage; the worst case was outright, total ruin. And for the first time, a group of United Nations–backed researchers began to have high-level discussions about the fate of the world: If this asteroid was going to hit the planet, what sort of spaceflight mission might be able to stop it? Would they ram a spacecraft into it to deflect it? Would they use nuclear weapons to try to swat it away or obliterate it completely?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, planetary defenders all over the world crewed their battle stations to see if we could avoid that fate—and despite the sometimes taxing new demands on their psyches and schedules, they remained some of the coolest customers in the galaxy. “I’ve had to cancel an appointment saying, &lt;em&gt;I cannot come—I have to save the planet&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and one of those who tracked down 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then, just as quick as history was made, experts declared that the danger had passed. On February 24, asteroid trackers issued the all-clear: Earth would be spared, just as many planetary defense researchers had felt assured it would.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising (and rising and rising) danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how, over a span of just two months, a sprawling network of global astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed 2024 YR4, the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was not an exercise,” says Hainaut. This was the real thing: “We really [had] to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;IN THE BEGINNING&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 27, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ASTEROID TERRESTRIAL-IMPACT LAST ALERT SYSTEM, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long ago, an asteroid in the space-rock highway between Mars and Jupiter felt a disturbance in the force: the gravitational pull of Jupiter itself, king of the planets. After some wobbling back and forth, this asteroid was thrown out of the belt, skipped around the sun, and found itself on an orbit that overlapped with Earth’s own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was the first one to see the detections of it,” Larry Denneau, of the University of Hawai‘i, recalls. “A tiny white pixel on a black background.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denneau is one of the principal investigators at the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopic network. It may have been just two days after Christmas, but as usual, he followed procedure as if it were any other day of the year and sent the observations of the tiny pixel onward to another NASA-funded facility, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s an alternate reality in which none of this happened. Fortunately, in our timeline, various space agencies—chiefly NASA, but also the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—invest millions of dollars every year in asteroid-spotting efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And while multiple nations host observatories capable of performing this work, the US clearly leads the way: Its planetary defense program provides funding to a suite of telescopic facilities solely dedicated to identifying potentially hazardous space rocks. (At least, it leads the way for the moment. The White House’s proposal for draconian budget cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation mean that several observatories and space missions linked to planetary defense are facing funding losses or outright terminations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers working at these observatories are tasked with finding threatening asteroids before they find us—because you can’t fight what you can’t see. “They are the first line of planetary defense,” says Kelly Fast, the acting planetary defense officer at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;ATLAS is one part of this skywatching project, and it consists of four telescopes: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and another in South Africa. They don’t operate the way you’d think, with astronomers peering through them all night. Instead, they operate “completely robotically and automatically,” says Denneau. Driven by coding scripts that he and his colleagues have developed, these mechanical eyes work in harmony to watch out for any suspicious space rocks. Astronomers usually monitor their survey of the sky from a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ATLAS telescopes are small, so they can’t see particularly distant objects. But they have a wide field of view, allowing them to see large patches of space at any one moment. “As long as the weather is good, we’re constantly monitoring the night sky, from the North Pole to the South Pole,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Larry Denneau" class="wp-image-1119851" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/denneau-larry_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Larry Denneau, a principal investigator at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescopic network.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they detect the starlight reflecting off a moving object, an operator, such as Denneau, gets an alert and visually verifies that the object is real and not some sort of imaging artifact. When a suspected asteroid (or comet) is identified, the observations are sent to the MPC, which is home to a bulletin board featuring (among other things) orbital data on all known asteroids and comets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the object isn’t already listed, a new discovery is announced, and other astronomers can perform follow-up observations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In just the past few years, ATLAS has detected more than 1,200 asteroids with near-Earth orbits. Finding ultimately harmless space rocks is routine work—so much so that when the new near-Earth asteroid was spotted by ATLAS’s Chilean telescope that December day, it didn’t even raise any eyebrows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau had simply been sitting at home,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;doing some late-night work on his computer. At the time, of course, he didn’t know that his telescope had just spied what would soon become a history-making asteroid—one that could alter the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MPC quickly confirmed the new space rock hadn’t already been “found,” and astronomers gave it a provisional designation: 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CATALINA SKY SURVEY, ARIZONA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the discovery was shared with another NASA-funded facility: the Catalina Sky Survey, a nest of three telescopes in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson that works out of the University of Arizona. “We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of its comet and asteroid spotters. Unlike ATLAS, these telescopes (although aided by automation) often have an in-person astronomer available to quickly alter the surveys in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119794" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kacper_teleskop.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of the comet and asteroid spotters at the Catalina Sky Survey north of Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when Catalina was alerted about what its peers at ATLAS had spotted, staff deployed its Schmidt telescope—a smaller one that excels at seeing bright objects moving extremely quickly. As they fed their own observations of 2024 YR4 to the MPC, Catalina engineer David Rankin looked back over imagery from the previous days and found the new asteroid lurking in a night-sky image taken on December 26. Around then, ATLAS also realized that it had caught sight of 2024 YR4 in a photograph from December 25.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The combined observations confirmed it: The asteroid had made its closest approach to Earth on Christmas Day, meaning it was already heading back out into space. But where, exactly, was this space rock going? Where would it end up after it swung around the sun?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the answer to that question was Earth, Davide Farnocchia would be one of the first to know. You could say he’s one of NASA’s watchers on the wall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he’s remarkably calm about his duties. When he first heard about 2024 YR4, he barely flinched. It was just another asteroid drifting through space not terribly far from Earth. It was another box to be ticked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it was logged by the MPC, it was Farnocchia’s job to try to plot out 2024 YR4’s possible paths through space, checking to see if any of them overlapped with our planet’s. He works at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) in California, where he’s partly responsible for keeping track of all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system. “We have 1.4 million objects to deal with,” he says, matter-of-factly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, astronomers would have had to stitch together multiple images of this asteroid and plot out its possible trajectories. Today, fortunately, Farnocchia has some help: He oversees the digital brain Sentry, an autonomous system he helped code. (Two other facilities in Italy perform similar work: the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, or NEOCC, and the privately owned Near-Earth Objects Dynamics Site, or NEODyS.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To chart their courses, Sentry uses every new observation of every known asteroid or comet listed on the MPC to continuously refine the orbits of all those objects, using the immutable laws of gravity and the gravitational influences of any planets, moons, or other sizable asteroids they pass. A recent update to the software means that even the ever-so-gentle push afforded by sunlight is accounted for. That allows Sentry to confidently project the motions of all these objects at least a century into the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Davide Farnocchia" class="wp-image-1119852" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/farnocchia-david_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Davide Farnocchia, who helps track all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system at NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost all newly discovered asteroids are quickly found to pose no impact risk. But those that stand even an infinitesimally small chance of smashing into our planet within the next 100 years are placed on the Sentry Risk List until additional observations can rule out those awful possibilities. Better safe than sorry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In late December, with just a limited set of data, Sentry concluded that there was a non-negligible chance 2024 YR4 would strike Earth in 2032. Aegis, the equivalent software at Europe’s NEOCC site, agreed. No bother. More observations would very likely remove 2024 YR4 from the Risk List. Just another day at the office for Farnocchia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that an asteroid heading toward Earth isn’t always a problem. Small rocks burn up in the planet’s atmosphere several times a day; you’ve probably seen one already this year, on a moonless night. But above a certain size, these rocks turn from innocuous shooting stars into nuclear-esque explosions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflected starlight is great for initially spotting asteroids, but it’s a terrible way to determine how big they are. A large, dull rock reflects as much light as a bright, tiny rock, making them appear the same to many telescopes. And that’s a problem, considering that a rock around 30 feet long will explode loudly but inconsequentially in Earth’s atmosphere, while a 3,000-foot-long asteroid would slam into the ground and cause devastation on a global scale, imperiling all of civilization. Roughly speaking, if you double the size of an asteroid, it becomes eight times more energetic upon impact—so finding out the size of an Earthbound asteroid is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In those first few hours after it was discovered, and before anyone knew how shiny or dull its surface was, 2024 YR4 was estimated by astronomers to be as small as 65 feet across or as large as 500 feet. An object of the former size would blow up in mid-air, shattering windows over many miles and likely injuring thousands of people. At the latter size it would vaporize the heart of any city it struck, turning solid rock and metal into liquid and vapor, while its blast wave would devastate the rest of it, killing hundreds of thousands or even millions in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now the question was: Just how big &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; 2024 YR4?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;REFINING THE PICTURE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understandably dissatisfied with that level of imprecision, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), high up on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile’s Atacama Desert, entered the chat. As the name suggests, this flagship facility is vast, and it’s capable of really zooming in on distant objects. Or to put it another way: “The VLT is the largest, biggest, best telescope in the world,” says Hainaut, one of the facility’s operators, who usually commands it from half a world away in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In reality, the VLT—which lends a hand to the European Space Agency in its asteroid-hunting duties—is actually made up of four massive telescopes, each fixed on four separate corners of the sky. They can be combined to act as a huge light bucket, allowing astronomers to see very faint asteroids. Four additional, smaller, movable telescopes can also team up with their bigger siblings to provide remarkably high-resolution images of even the stealthiest space rocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YR4-2.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In this sequence of infrared images taken by ESO's VLT, the individual image frames have been aligned so that the asteroid remains in the center as other stars appear to move around it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="video-credit"&gt;ESO/O. HAINAUT ET AL.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With so much tech to oversee, the control room of the VLT looks a bit like the inside of the Death Star. “You have eight consoles, each of them with a dozen screens. It’s big, it’s large, it’s spectacular,” says Hainaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-January, the European Space Agency asked the VLT to study several asteroids that had somewhat suspicious near-Earth orbits—including 2024 YR4. With just a few lines of code, the VLT could easily train its sharp eyes on an asteroid like 2024 YR4, allowing astronomers to narrow down its size range. It was found to be at least 130 feet long (big enough to cause major damage in a city) and as much as 300 feet (able to annihilate one).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 29, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marco Fenucci" class="wp-image-1119854" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fenucci-marco_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the month, there was no mistaking it: 2024 YR4 stood a greater than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you see very often,” says Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at NEOCC. He admits that although it was “a serious thing,” this escalation was also “exciting to see”—something straight out of a sci-fi flick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sentry and Aegis, along with the systems at NEODyS, had been checking one another’s calculations. “There was a lot of care,” says Farnocchia, who explains that even though their programs worked wonders, their predictions were manually verified by multiple experts. When a rarity like 2024 YR4 comes along, he says, “you kind of switch gears, and you start being more cautious. You start screening everything that comes in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the klaxon emanating from these three data centers pushed the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a UN-backed planetary defense awareness group, to issue a public alert to the world’s governments: &lt;em&gt;The planet may be in peril.&lt;/em&gt; For the most part, it was at this moment that the media—and the wider public—became aware of the threat. Earth, we may have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Denneau, along with plenty of other astronomers, received an urgent email from Fast at NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office, requesting that all capable observatories track this hazardous asteroid. But there was one glaring problem. When 2024 YR4 was discovered on December 27, it was already two days after it had made its closest approach to Earth. And since it was heading back out into the shadows of space, it was quickly fading from sight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once it gets too faint, “there’s not much ATLAS can do,” Denneau says. By the time of IAWN’s warning, planetary defenders had just weeks to try to track 2024 YR4 and refine the odds of its hitting Earth before they’d lose it to the darkness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if their scopes failed, the odds of an Earth impact would have stayed uncomfortably high until 2028, when the asteroid was due to make another flyby of the planet. That’d be just four short years before the space rock might actually hit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“In that situation, we would have been … in trouble,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The hunt was on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;PREPARING FOR THE WORST&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 5 and February 6, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE MISSION PLANNING ADVISORY GROUP, AUSTRIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early February, spaceflight mission specialists, including those at the UN-supported Space Mission Planning Advisory Group in Vienna, began high-level talks designed to sketch out ways in which 2024 YR4 could be either deflected away from Earth or obliterated—you know, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A range of options were available—including ramming it with several uncrewed spacecraft or assaulting it with nuclear weapons—but there was no silver bullet in this situation. Nobody had ever launched a nuclear explosive device into deep space before, and the geopolitical ramifications of any nuclear-armed nations doing so in the present day would prove deeply unwelcome. Asteroids are also extremely odd objects; some, perhaps including 2024 YR4, are less like single chunks of rock and more akin to multiple cliffs flying in formation. Hit an asteroid like that too hard and you could fail to deflect it—and instead turn an Earthbound cannonball into a spray of shotgun pellets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that early on, experts were concerned about whether they could prevent a potential disaster. Crucially, eight years was not actually much time to plan something of this scale. So they were keen to better pinpoint how likely, or unlikely, it was that 2024 YR4 was going to collide with the planet before any complex space mission planning began in earnest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people involved with these talks—from physicists at some of America’s most secretive nuclear weapons research laboratories to spaceflight researchers over in Europe—were not feeling close to anything resembling panic. But “the timeline was really short,” admits Hainaut. So there was an unprecedented tempo to their discussions. This wasn’t a drill. This was the real deal. What would they do to defend the planet if an asteroid impact couldn’t be ruled out?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, over the next few days, a handful of new observations came in. Each helped Sentry, Aegis, and the system at NEODyS rule out more of 2024 YR4’s possible future orbits. Unluckily, Earth remained a potential port of call for this pesky asteroid—and over time, our planet made up a higher proportion of those remaining possibilities. That meant that the odds of an Earth impact “started bubbling up,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a telescope in each of the four corners points to an asteroid" class="wp-image-1119775" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Redamonti_asteroid_7.2.25.jpg?w=1903" width="1903" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;EVA REDAMONTI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By February 6, they jumped to 2.3%—a one-in-43 chance of an impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“How much anxiety someone should feel over that—it’s hard to say,” Denneau says, with a slight shrug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the past, several elephantine asteroids have been found to stand a small chance of careening unceremoniously into the planet. Such incidents tend to follow a pattern. As more observations come in and the asteroid’s orbit becomes better known, an Earth impact trajectory remains a possibility while other outlying orbits are removed from the calculations—so for a time, the odds of an impact rise. Finally, with enough observations in hand, it becomes clear that the space rock will miss our world entirely, and the impact odds plummet to zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers expected this to repeat itself with 2024 YR4. But there was no guarantee. There’s no escaping the fact that one day, sooner or later, scientists will discover a dangerous asteroid that will punch Earth in the face—and raze a city in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, asteroids capable of trashing a city have found their way to Earth plenty of times before, and not just in the very distant past. In 1908, an 800-square-mile patch of forest in Siberia—one that was, fortunately, very sparsely populated—was decimated by a space rock just 180 feet long. It didn’t even hit the ground; it exploded in midair with the force of a 15-megaton blast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But only one other asteroid comparable in size to 2024 YR4 had its 2.3% figure beat: in 2004, Apophis—capable of causing continental-scale damage—had (briefly) stood a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapidly approaching uncharted waters, the powers that be at NASA decided to play a space-based wild card: the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A large dull asteroid reflects the same amount of light as a small shiny one, but that doesn’t mean astronomers sizing up an asteroid are helpless. If you view both asteroids in the infrared, the larger one glows brighter than the smaller one no matter the surface coating—making infrared, or the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum, a much better gauge of a space rock’s proportions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Observatories on Earth do have infrared capabilities, but our planet’s atmosphere gets in their way, making it hard for them to offer highly accurate readings of an asteroid’s size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), hanging out in space, doesn’t have that problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A collage of three images showing the black expanse of space. Two-thirds of the collage is taken up by the black background sprinkled with small, blurry galaxies in orange, blue, and white. There are two images in a column at the right side of the collage.

Observations were taken using both its NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to study the thermal properties of the asteroid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA, ESA, CSA, A. RIVKIN (APL), A. PAGAN (STSCI)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This observatory, which sits at a gravitationally stable point about a million miles from Earth, is polymathic. Its sniper-like scope can see in the infrared and allows it to peer at the edge of the observable universe, meaning it can study galaxies that formed not long after the Big Bang. It can even look at the light passing through the atmospheres of distant planets to ascertain their chemical makeups. And its remarkably sharp eye means it can also track the thermal glow of an asteroid long after all ground-based telescopes lose sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a fortuitous bit of timing, by the moment 2024 YR4 came along, planetary defenders had recently reasoned that JWST could theoretically be used to track ominous asteroids using its own infrared scope, should the need arise. So after IAWN’s warning went out, operators of JWST ran an analysis: Though the asteroid would vanish from most scopes by late March, this one might be able to see the rock until sometime in May, which would allow researchers to greatly refine their assessment of the asteroid’s orbit and its odds of making Earth impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Understanding 2024 YR4’s trajectory was important, but “the size was the main motivator,” says Andy Rivkin, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the&amp;nbsp;proposal&amp;nbsp;to use JWST to observe the asteroid. The hope was that even if the impact odds remained high until 2028, JWST would find that 2024 YR4 was on the smaller side of the 130-to-300-feet size range—meaning it would still be a danger, but a far less catastrophic one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JWST proposal was accepted by NASA on February 5. But the earliest it could conduct its observations was early March. And time really wasn’t on Earth’s side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 7, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GEMINI SOUTH TELESCOPE, CHILE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“At this point, [2024 YR4] was too faint for the Catalina telescopes,” says Catalina’s Wierzchoś. “In our opinion, this was a big deal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Wierzchoś and his colleagues put in a rare emergency request to commandeer the Gemini Observatory, an internationally funded and run facility featuring two large, eagle-eyed telescopes—one in Chile and one atop Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano. Their request was granted, and on February 7, they trained the Chile-based Gemini South telescope onto 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119781" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gemini_South_Captures_Asteroid_2024_YR4_noirlab2514a.jpg?w=1800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This composite image  was captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS), by a team of astronomers.

ZAMANI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The odds of Earth impact dropped ever so slightly, to 2.2% —a minor, but still welcome, development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By this point, the roster of 2024 YR4 hunters also included the tiny team operating the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), which sits atop a tranquil mountain in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s myself and my husband,” says Eileen Ryan, the MRO director. “We’re the only two astronomers running the telescope. We have a daytime technician. It’s kind of a mom-and-pop organization.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the scope shouldn’t be underestimated. “We can see maybe a cell-phone-size object that’s illuminated at geosynchronous orbit,” Ryan says, referring to objects 22,000 miles away. But its most impressive feature is its mobility. While other observatories have slowly swiveling telescopes, MRO’s scope can move like the wind. “We can track the fastest objects,” she says, with a grin—noting that the telescope was built in part to watch missiles for the US Air Force. Its agility and long-distance vision explain why the Space Force is one of MRO’s major clients: It can be used to spy on satellites and spacecraft anywhere from low Earth orbit right out to the lunar regions. And that meant spying on the super-speedy, super-sneaky 2024 YR4 wasn’t a problem for MRO, whose own observations were vital in refining the asteroid’s impact odds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Eileen Ryan" class="wp-image-1119855" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ryan-eileen_1.jpg?w=694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Eileen Ryan, the director of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY PHOTO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in mid-February, MRO and all ground-based observatories came up against an unsolvable problem: The full moon was out, shining so brightly that it blinded any telescope that dared point at the night sky. “During the full moon, the observatories couldn’t observe for a week or so,” says NEOCC’s Fenucci. To most of us, the moon is a beautiful silvery orb. But to astronomers, it’s a hostile actor. “We abhor the moon,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All any of them could do was wait. Those tracking 2024 YR4 vacillated between being animated and slightly trepidatious. The thought that the asteroid could still stand a decent chance of impacting Earth after it faded from view did weigh a little on their minds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Farnocchia maintained his characteristic sangfroid throughout. “I try to stress about the things I can control,” he says. “All we can do is to explain what the situation is, and that we need new data to say more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CENTER FOR NEAR-EARTH OBJECT STUDIES, CALIFORNIA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the full moon finally faded into a crescent of light, the world’s largest telescopes sprang back into action for one last shot at glory. “The dark time came again,” says Hainaut, with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;New observations finally began to trickle in, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS readjusted their forecasts. It wasn’t great news: The odds of an Earth impact in 2032 jumped up to 3.1%, officially making 2024 YR4 the most dangerous asteroid ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This declaration made headlines across the world—and certainly made the curious public sit up and wonder if they had yet another apocalyptic concern to fret about. But, as ever, the asteroid hunters held fast in their prediction that sooner or later—ideally sooner—more observations would cause those impact odds to drop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We kept at it,” says Ryan. But time was running short; they started to “search for out-of-the-box ways to image this asteroid,” says Fenucci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defense researchers soon realized that 2024 YR4 wasn’t too far away from NASA’s Lucy spacecraft, a planetary science mission making a series of flybys of various asteroids. If Lucy could be redirected to catch up to 2024 YR4 instead, it would give humanity its best look at the rock, allowing Sentry and company to confirm or dispel our worst fears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, NASA ran the numbers, and it proved to be a nonstarter: 2024 YR4 was too speedy and too far for Lucy to pursue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was really starting to look as if JWST would be the last, best hope to track 2024 YR4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CHANGE OF FATE&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 19, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERY LARGE TELESCOPE, CHILE and MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY, NEW MEXICO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just one day after 2024 YR made history, the VLT, MRO, and others caught sight of it again, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS voraciously consumed their new data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odds of an Earth impact suddenly dropped to 1.5%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Astronomers didn’t really have time to react to the possibility that this was a good sign—they just kept sending their observations onward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 20, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUBARU TELESCOPE, HAWAII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet another observatory had been itching to get into the game for weeks, but it wasn’t until February 20 that Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, sitting atop Mauna Kea, finally caught 2024 YR4 shifting between the stars. He added his data to the stream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden, the asteroid lost its lethal luster. The odds of its hitting Earth were now just 0.3%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, you might expect that all those tracking it would be in a single control room somewhere, eyes glued to their screens, watching the odds drop before bursting into cheers and rapturous applause. But no—the astronomers who had spent so long observing this asteroid remained scattered across the globe. And instead of erupting into cheers, they exchanged modestly worded emails of congratulations—the digital equivalent of a nod or a handshake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Tsuyoshi Tera at a workstation with many monitors" class="wp-image-1119786" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20200715-subaru-fig-full_Terai.jpg?w=2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In late February, data from Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan’s Subaru Telescope, which sits atop Mauna Kea, confirmed that 2024 YR4 was not so lethal after all.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a relief,” says Terai. “I was very pleased that our data contributed to put an end to the risk of 2024 YR4.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 24, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL ASTEROID WARNING NETWORK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few days later, and thanks to a litany of observations continuing to flood in, IAWN issued the all-clear. This once-ominous asteroid’s odds of inconveniencing our planet were at 0.004%—one in 25,000. Today, the odds of an Earth impact in 2032 are exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was kinda fun while it lasted,” says Denneau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Planetary defenders may have had a blast defending the world, but these astronomers still took the cosmic threat deeply seriously—and never once took their eyes off the prize. “In my mind, the observers and orbit teams were the stars of this story,” says Fast, NASA’s acting planetary defense officer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Farnocchia shrugs off the entire thing. “It was the expected outcome,” he says. “We just didn’t know when that would happen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on it now, though, some 2024 YR4 trackers are allowing themselves to dwell on just how close this asteroid came to being a major danger. “It’s wild to watch it all play out,” says Denneau. “We were weeks away from having to spin up some serious mitigation planning.” But there was no need to work out how the save the world. It turned out that 2024 YR4 was never a threat to begin with—it just took a while to check.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And these experiences in handling a dicey space rock will only serve to make the world a safer place to live. One day, an asteroid very much like 2024 YR4 will be seen heading straight for Earth. And those tasked with tracking it will be officially battle-tested, and better prepared than ever to do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A POSTSCRIPT&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, DEEP SPACE, ONE MILLION MILES FROM EARTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the story of 2024 YR4 is not quite over—in fact, if this were a movie, it would have an after-credits scene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the Earth-impact odds fell off a cliff, JWST went ahead with its observations in March anyway. It found out that 2024 YR4 was 200 feet across—so large that a direct strike on a city would have proved horrifically lethal. Earth just didn’t have to worry about it anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the moon might. Thanks in part to JWST, astronomers calculated a 3.8% chance that 2024 YR4 will impact the lunar surface in 2032. Additional JWST observations in May bumped those odds up slightly, to 4.3%, and the orbit can no longer be refined until the asteroid’s next Earth flyby in 2028.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It may hit the moon!” says Denneau. “Everybody’s still very excited about that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lunar collision would give astronomers a wonderful opportunity not only to study the physics of an asteroid impact, but also to demonstrate to the public just how good they are at precisely predicting the future motions of potentially lethal space rocks. “It’s a thing we can plan for without having to defend the Earth,” says Denneau.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If 2024 YR4 is truly going to smash into the moon, the impact—likely on the side facing Earth—would unleash an explosion equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. An expansive crater would be carved out in the blink of an eye, and a shower of debris would erupt in all directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this supersonic wreckage would pose any danger to Earth, but it would look spectacular: You’d be able to see the bright flash of the impact from terra firma with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If that does happen, it’ll be amazing,” says Denneau. It will be a spectacular way to see the saga of 2024 YR4—once a mere speck on his computer screen—come to an explosive end, from a front-row seat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But neural networks are, after all, &lt;em&gt;neural&lt;/em&gt;—they’re inspired by brains. Despite their vastly different appetites for energy and data, large language models and human brains do share a good deal in common. They’re both made up of millions of subcomponents: biological neurons in the case of the brain, simulated “neurons” in the case of networks. They’re the only two things on Earth that can fluently and flexibly produce language. &lt;strong&gt;And scientists barely understand how either of them works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can testify to those similarities: I came to journalism, and to AI, by way of six years of neuroscience graduate school. It’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology. Last week, the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. Both studies propose that these trained networks could help scientists advance their understanding of the human mind. But predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one of the studies, researchers transformed a large language model into what they refer to as a “foundation model of human cognition.” Out of the box, large language models aren’t great at mimicking human behavior—they behave logically in settings where humans abandon reason, such as casinos. So the researchers fine-tuned Llama 3.1, one of Meta’s open-source LLMs, on data from a range of 160 psychology experiments, which involved tasks like choosing from a set of “slot machines” to get the maximum payout or remembering sequences of letters. They called the resulting model Centaur.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with conventional psychological models, which use simple math equations, Centaur did a far better job of predicting behavior. Accurate predictions of how humans respond in psychology experiments are valuable in and of themselves: For example, scientists could use Centaur to pilot their experiments on a computer before recruiting, and paying, human participants. In their paper, however, the researchers propose that Centaur could be more than just a prediction machine. By interrogating the mechanisms that allow Centaur to effectively replicate human behavior, they argue, scientists could develop new theories about the inner workings of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But some psychologists doubt whether Centaur can tell us much about the mind at all.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, it’s better than conventional psychological models at predicting how humans behave—but it also has a billion times more parameters. And just because a model behaves like a human on the outside doesn’t mean that it functions like one on the inside. Olivia Guest, an assistant professor of computational cognitive science at Radboud University in the Netherlands, compares Centaur to a calculator, which can effectively predict the response a math whiz will give when asked to add two numbers. “I don’t know what you would learn about human addition by studying a calculator,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even if Centaur does capture something important about human psychology, scientists may struggle to extract any insight from the model’s millions of neurons. Though AI researchers are working hard to figure out how large language models work, they’ve barely managed to crack open the black box. Understanding an enormous neural-network model of the human mind may not prove much easier than understanding the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One alternative approach is to go small. &lt;/strong&gt;The second of the two &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; studies focuses on minuscule neural networks—some containing only a single neuron—that nevertheless can predict behavior in mice, rats, monkeys, and even humans. Because the networks are so small, it’s possible to track the activity of each individual neuron and use that data to figure out how the network is producing its behavioral predictions. And while there’s no guarantee that these models function like the brains they were trained to mimic, they can, at the very least, generate testable hypotheses about human and animal cognition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a cost to comprehensibility. Unlike Centaur, which was trained to mimic human behavior in dozens of different tasks, each tiny network can only predict behavior in one specific task. One network, for example, is specialized for making predictions about how people choose among different slot machines. “If the behavior is really complex, you need a large network,” says Marcelo Mattar, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who led the tiny-network study and also contributed to Centaur. “The compromise, of course, is that now understanding it is very, very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This trade-off between prediction and understanding is a key feature of neural-network-driven science. &lt;/strong&gt;(I also happen to be writing a book about it.) Studies like Mattar’s are making some progress toward closing that gap—as tiny as his networks are, they can predict behavior more accurately than traditional psychological models. So is the research into LLM interpretability happening at places like Anthropic. For now, however, our understanding of complex systems—from humans to climate systems to proteins—is lagging farther and farther behind our ability to make predictions about them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in&amp;nbsp;The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors. But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants. Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and are home to many of the world’s pioneering private fusion efforts. The West has consequently developed many of the basic technologies that will make fusion power work. But in the past five years China’s support of fusion energy has surged, threatening to allow the country to dominate the industry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The industrial base available to support China’s nascent fusion energy industry could enable it to climb the learning curve much faster and more effectively than the West. Commercialization requires know-how, capabilities, and complementary assets, including supply chains and workforces in adjacent industries. And especially in comparison with China, the US and Europe have significantly under-supported the industrial assets needed for a fusion industry, such as thin-film processing and power electronics.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To compete, the US, allies, and partners must invest more heavily not only in fusion itself—which is already happening—but also in those adjacent technologies that are critical to the fusion industrial base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China’s trajectory to dominating fusion and the West’s potential route to competing can be understood by looking at today’s most promising scientific and engineering pathway to achieve grid-relevant fusion energy. That pathway relies on the tokamak, a technology that uses a magnetic field to confine ionized gas—called plasma—and ultimately fuse nuclei. This process releases energy that is converted from heat to electricity. Tokamaks consist of several critical systems, including plasma confinement and heating, fuel production and processing, blankets and heat flux management, and power conversion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A close look at the adjacent industries needed to build these critical systems clearly shows China’s advantage while also providing a glimpse into the challenges of building a fusion industrial base in the US or Europe. China has leadership in three of these six key industries, and the West is at risk of losing leadership in two more. China’s industrial might in thin-film processing, large metal-alloy structures, and power electronics provides a strong foundation to establish the upstream supply chain for fusion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The importance of thin-film processing is evident in the plasma confinement system. Tokamaks use strong electromagnets to keep the fusion plasma in place, and the magnetic coils must be made from superconducting materials. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconductors are the highest-performing materials available in sufficient quantity to be viable for use in fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The REBCO industry, which relies on thin-film processing technologies, currently has low production volumes spanning globally distributed manufacturers. However, as the fusion industry grows, the manufacturing base for REBCO will likely consolidate among the industry players who are able to rapidly take advantage of economies of scale. China is today’s world leader in thin-film, high-volume manufacturing for solar panels and flat-panel displays, with the associated expert workforce, tooling sector, infrastructure, and upstream materials supply chain. Without significant attention and investment on the part of the West, China is well positioned to dominate REBCO thin-film processing for fusion magnets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in a full-scale tokamak are as tall as a three-story building. Structures made using strong metal alloys are needed to hold these electromagnets around the large vacuum vessel that physically contains the magnetically confined plasma. Similar large-scale, complex metal structures are required for shipbuilding, aerospace, oil and gas infrastructure, and turbines. But fusion plants will require new versions of the alloys that are radiation-tolerant, able to withstand cryogenic temperatures, and corrosion-resistant. China’s manufacturing capacity and its metallurgical research efforts position it well to outcompete other global suppliers in making the necessary specialty metal alloys and machining them into the complex structures needed for fusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A tokamak also requires large-scale power electronics. Here again China dominates. Similar systems are found in the high-speed rail (HSR) industry, renewable microgrids, and arc furnaces. As of 2024, China had deployed over 48,000 kilometers of HSR. That is three times the length of Europe’s HSR network and 55 times as long as the Acela network in the US, which is slower than HSR. While other nations have a presence, China’s expertise is more recent and is being applied on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But this is not the end of the story. The West still has an opportunity to lead the other three adjacent industries important to the fusion supply chain: cryo-plants, fuel processing, and blankets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electromagnets in an operational tokamak need to be kept at cryogenic temperatures of around 20 Kelvin to remain superconducting. This requires large-scale, multi-megawatt cryogenic cooling plants. Here, the country best set up to lead the industry is less clear. The two major global suppliers of cryo-plants are Europe-based Linde Engineering and Air Liquide Engineering; the US has Air Products and Chemicals and Chart Industries. But they are not alone: China’s domestic champions in the cryogenic sector include Hangyang Group, SASPG, Kaifeng Air Separation, and SOPC. Each of these regions already has an industrial base that could scale up to meet the demands of fusion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fuel production for fusion is a nascent part of the industrial base requiring processing technologies for light-isotope gases—hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium. Some processing of light-isotope gases is already done at small scale in medicine, hydrogen weapons production, and scientific research in the US, Europe, and China. But the scale needed for the fusion industry does not exist in today’s industrial base, presenting a major opportunity to develop the needed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Similarly, blankets and heat flux management are an opportunity for the West. The blanket is the medium used to absorb energy from the fusion reaction and to breed tritium. Commercial-scale blankets will require entirely novel technology. To date, no adjacent industries have relevant commercial expertise in liquid lithium, lead-lithium eutectic, or fusion-specific molten salts that are required for blanket technology. Some overlapping blanket technologies are in early-stage development by the nuclear fission industry. As the largest producer of beryllium in the world, the US has an opportunity to capture leadership because that element is a key material in leading fusion blanket concepts. But the use of beryllium must be coupled with technology development programs for the other specialty blanket components.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These six industries will prove critical to scaling fusion energy. In some, such as thin-film processing and large metal-alloy structures, China already has a sizable advantage. Crucially, China recognizes the importance of these adjacent industries and is actively harnessing them in its fusion efforts. For example, China launched a fusion consortium that consists of industrial giants spanning the steel, machine tooling, electric grid, power generation, and aerospace sectors. It will be extremely difficult for the West to catch up in these areas, but policymakers and business leaders must pay attention and try to create robust alternative supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the industrial area of greatest strength, cryo-plants could continue to be an opportunity for leadership in the West. Bolstering Western cryo-plant production by creating demand for natural-gas liquefaction will be a major boon to the future cryo-plant supply chain that will support fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and European countries also have an opportunity to lead in the emerging industrial areas of fuel processing and blanket technologies. Doing so will require policymakers to work with companies to ensure that public and private funding is allocated to these critical emerging supply chains. Governments may well need to serve as early customers and provide debt financing for significant capital investment. Governments can also do better to incentivize private capital and equity financing—for example, through favorable capital-gains taxation. In lagging areas of thin-film and alloy production, the US and Europe will likely need partners, such as South Korea and Japan, that have the industrial bases to compete globally with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to connect and capitalize multiple industries and supply chains will require long-term thinking and clear leadership. A focus on the demand side of these complementary industries is essential. Fusion is a decade away from maturation, so its supplier base must be derisked and made profitable in the near term by focusing on other primary demand markets that contribute to our economic vitality. To name a few, policymakers can support modernization of the grid to bolster domestic demand for power electronics and domestic semiconductor manufacturing to support thin-film processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The West must also focus on the demand for energy production itself. As the world’s largest energy consumer, China will leverage demand from its massive domestic market to climb the learning curve and bolster national champions. This is a strategy that China has wielded with tremendous success to dominate global manufacturing, most recently in the electric-vehicle industry. Taken together, supply- and demand-side investment have been a winning strategy for China.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The competition to lead the future of fusion energy is here. Now is the moment for the US and its Western allies to start investing in the foundational innovation ecosystem needed for a vibrant and resilient industrial base to support it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel F.

Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors. But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants.

Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. Then, just days later on February 24, experts declared that the danger had passed.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How scientists are trying to use AI to unlock the human mind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI landscape is defined by the ways in which neural networks are unlike human brains. A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite that, it’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the prestigious journal Nature published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. However, predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.

But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. Then, just days later on February 24, experts declared that the danger had passed. Earth would be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it’d miss us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of how a sprawling network of astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Robin George Andrews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is part of the Big Story series: &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s most important, ambitious reporting.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How scientists are trying to use AI to unlock the human mind&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI landscape is defined by the ways in which neural networks are unlike human brains. A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite that, it’s a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the prestigious journal Nature published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. However, predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.

Brunner, Edlyn V. Levine, Fiona E. Murray, &amp;amp; Rory Burke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Fusion energy holds the potential to shift a geopolitical landscape that is currently configured around fossil fuels. Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.

The fraudsters &lt;strong&gt;used voice over internet protocol technology &lt;/strong&gt;to&amp;nbsp;dupe victims into believing the calls came from their grandchildren in the US, customizing conversations using banks of personal data, including ages, addresses, and the estimated incomes of their victims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) &lt;strong&gt;has also made it possible to clone a voice &lt;/strong&gt;with nothing more than an hour of YouTube footage and an $11 subscription. And fraudsters are using such tools to create increasingly more sophisticated attacks to deceive victims with alarming success. But phone scams are just one way that bad actors are weaponizing technology to refine and scale attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119046" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MITTR_Plaid2025_V10_Cover61625.png?w=1555" width="1555" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic identity fraud now costs banks $6 billion a year, &lt;strong&gt;making it the fastest-growing financial crime in the US &lt;/strong&gt;Criminals are able to exploit personal data breaches to fabricate “Frankenstein IDs.” Cheap credential-stuffing software can be used to test thousands of stolen credentials across multiple platforms in a matter of minutes. And text-to-speech tools powered by AI can bypass voice authentication systems with ease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Technology is both catalyzing and transformative,” says John Pitts, head of industry relations and digital trust at Plaid. “Catalyzing in that it has accelerated and&amp;nbsp;made more intense longstanding types of fraud. And transformative in that it has created windows for new, scaled-up types of fraud.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In advance-fee scams, for instance, where fraudsters pose as benefactors gifting large sums in exchange for an upfront fee, scammers can use AI to identify victims at a far greater rate and at a much lower&amp;nbsp;cost than ever before. They can then use AI tools to carry out tens of thousands, if not millions, of simultaneous digital conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Download the full report.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

The fraudsters &lt;strong&gt;used voice over internet protocol technology &lt;/strong&gt;to&amp;nbsp;dupe victims into believing the calls came from their grandchildren in the US, customizing conversations using banks of personal data, including ages, addresses, and the estimated incomes of their victims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) &lt;strong&gt;has also made it possible to clone a voice &lt;/strong&gt;with nothing more than an hour of YouTube footage and an $11 subscription. And fraudsters are using such tools to create increasingly more sophisticated attacks to deceive victims with alarming success. But phone scams are just one way that bad actors are weaponizing technology to refine and scale attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1119046" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MITTR_Plaid2025_V10_Cover61625.png?w=1555" width="1555" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic identity fraud now costs banks $6 billion a year, &lt;strong&gt;making it the fastest-growing financial crime in the US &lt;/strong&gt;Criminals are able to exploit personal data breaches to fabricate “Frankenstein IDs.” Cheap credential-stuffing software can be used to test thousands of stolen credentials across multiple platforms in a matter of minutes. And text-to-speech tools powered by AI can bypass voice authentication systems with ease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Technology is both catalyzing and transformative,” says John Pitts, head of industry relations and digital trust at Plaid. “Catalyzing in that it has accelerated and&amp;nbsp;made more intense longstanding types of fraud. And transformative in that it has created windows for new, scaled-up types of fraud.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In advance-fee scams, for instance, where fraudsters pose as benefactors gifting large sums in exchange for an upfront fee, scammers can use AI to identify victims at a far greater rate and at a much lower&amp;nbsp;cost than ever before. They can then use AI tools to carry out tens of thousands, if not millions, of simultaneous digital conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Download the full report.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

From creating the world’s largest airport factory during World War II at Willow Run to establishing the first successful polio vaccine trials in Ann Arbor to the invention of the snowboard in Muskegon, Michigan has a long history of turning innovation into lasting impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, with the creation of a new role, chief innovation ecosystem officer, at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), the state is doubling down on its ambition to become a modern engine of innovation, one that is both rooted in its industrial past and designed for the evolving demands of the 21st century economy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do you knit together risk capital founders, businesses, universities, and state government, all of the key stakeholders that need to be at the table together to build a more effective innovation ecosystem?” asks Ben Marchionna, the first to hold this groundbreaking new position.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leaning on his background in hard tech startups and national security, Marchionna aims to bring a “builder's thinking” to the state government. “I'm sort of wired for that—rapid prototyping, iterating, scaling, and driving that muscle into the state government ecosystem,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But these efforts aren’t about creating a copycat Silicon Valley. Michigan’s approach is uniquely its own. “We want to develop the thing that makes the most sense for the ingredients that Michigan can bring to bear to this challenge,” says Marchionna.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This includes cultivating both mom-and-pop businesses and tech unicorns, while tapping into the state’s talent, research, and manufacturing DNA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an era where economic development often feels siloed, partisan, and reactive, Michigan is experimenting with a model centered on long-term value and community-oriented innovation. “You can lead by example in a lot of these ways, and that flywheel really can get going in a beautiful way when you step out of the prescriptive innovation culture mindset,” says Marchionna.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Transcript&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan Tatum:&lt;/em&gt; From MIT Technology Review. I'm Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's episode is brought to you in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our topic today is building a statewide innovation economy. Now, the U.S. state of Michigan has long been recognized as a leader in vehicle and mobility innovation. Detroit put it on the map, but did you know it's also the birthplace of the snowboard or that the University of Michigan filed more than 600 invention disclosures in 2024, second only to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or that in the past five years, 40% of the largest global IPOs have been Michigan built companies?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two words for you: innovation ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My guest is Ben Marchionna, chief innovation ecosystem officer at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the MEDC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Ben, thank you ever so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben Marchionna:&lt;/em&gt; Thanks, Megan. Really pleased to be here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. And just to set some context to get us started, I wondered if we could take a kind of high-level look at the economic development landscape. I mean, you joined the MEDC team last year as Michigan's first chief innovation ecosystem officer. In fact, you were the first to hold such a role in the country, I believe. I wondered if you could talk a bit about your unique mission and how this economic development approach differs from efforts in other states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, sure would love to. Probably worth pointing out that while I've been in this role for about a year now, it was indeed a first-of-its-kind role in the state of Michigan and first of its kind in the country. The slight difference in the terminology, chief innovation ecosystem officer, it differs a little bit from what folks might think of as a chief innovation officer. I'm not all that focused on driving innovation within government, which is what some other chief innovation officers would be focused on around the country. Instead, you can think of my role as Michigan's chief architect for innovation, if you will. So, how do you knit together risk capital founders, businesses, universities, and state government, all of the key stakeholders that need to be at the table together to build a more effective innovation ecosystem? I talk a lot about building connective tissues that can achieve one plus one equals three outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michigan's got all kinds of really interesting ingredients and has the foundation to take advantage of the moment in a really interesting way over the next decades as we look to supercharge some of the growth of our innovation ecosystem development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My charter is relatively simple. It's to help make sure that Michigan wins in a now hyper-competitive global economy. And to do that, I end up being super focused on orienting us towards a growth and innovation-driven economy. That can mean a lot of different things, but I ultimately came to the MEDC and the role within the state with a builder's mindset. My background is not in traditional economic development, it's in not government at all. I spent the last 10 years building hard tech startups, one in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and another one in the Northern Virginia area. Before that, I spent a number of years at, think of it like, an innovation factory at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in the Mojave Desert, working on national security projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'm sort of wired for that, builder's thinking, rapid prototyping, iterating, scaling, and driving that muscle into the state government ecosystem. I think it's important that the government also figure out how to pull out all the stops and be able to move at the speed that founders expect. A bias towards action, if you will. And so this is ultimately what my mission is. There are a lot of real interesting things that the state of Michigan can bring to bear to building our innovation ecosystem. And I think, tackling it with this sort of a mindset, I am absolutely optimistic for the future that we've got ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. It almost sounds like your role is sort of building a statewide startup incubator of sorts. As we mentioned in the opening, Michigan actually has a really interesting innovation history even in addition to the advances in the automotive industry. I wondered if you could talk a bit more about that history and why Michigan, in particular, is poised to support that sort of statewide startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, absolutely. And I would even broaden it. Building the startup ecosystem is one of the essential layers, but to be able to successfully do that, we have to bring in the research universities, we have to bring in the corporate innovation ecosystem, we have to bring in the risk capital, et cetera. So yes, absolutely, startups are important. And equally as important are all of these other elements that are necessary for a startup ecosystem to thrive, but are also the levers that are just sitting there waiting for us to pull them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we can get into some of the details over the course of our chat today on the auto industry and how this fits into it, but Michigan does a lot more than just automotive stuff. And you noted, I think, the surfboard as an example in the intro. Absolutely correct. We have a reputation as Motor City, but Michigan's innovation record is a lot weirder in a fun way and richer than just cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 20th century, mostly industrial moonshot innovation. So first paved mile of concrete was in Detroit in 1909. A few years later, this is when the auto sector started to really come about with Henry Ford's moving assembly line. Everyone tends to know about those details. But during World War II, Willow Run Airport sort of smack between Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan they had the biggest airplane factory in the world. They were cranking out B-24 bombers once every 63 minutes, and I've actually been to the office that Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh shared. It's still at the airport. And it was pretty cool because Henry Ford had a window built into the office that looked sort of around the corner so that he could tick off as airplanes rolled out of the hanger and make sure that they were following the same high rate production mentality that the auto sector was able to develop over the decades prior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And so they came in to help make sure that you could leverage that industrial sector to drive very rapid production, the at-scale mentality, which is also a really important part of the notion of re-industrialization that is taking hold across the country now. Happy to get into that a bit, but yeah, Willow Run, I don't think most folks realize that that was the biggest airplane factory in the world sitting right here in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all of this provided the mass production DNA that was able to help build the statewide supplier base. And today, yes, we use that for automotive, EVs, space hardware, batteries, you name it. But this is the foundation, I think, that we've got to be able to build on in the future. In the few decades since you saw innovations in sports, space, advanced materials, it's like the sixties to the eighties. You said the snowboard. That was invented in Muskegon on the west side of the state in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical's here in a really big way. They've pioneered silicone and advanced plastics in Michigan. University of Michigan's Dr. Thomas Francis is the world's first successful polio vaccine trials that were pioneered out of Ann Arbor, and that Big 10 research horsepower that we've got in the state, between the University of Michigan, Michigan State University. We also have Wayne State University in Detroit, which is a powerhouse. And then Michigan Tech University in the Upper Peninsula just recently became an R1 research institution, which essentially means those top-tier research powerhouses and that culture of tinkering matter a lot today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think in more recent history, you saw design and digital innovations emerge. I don't think a lot of people appreciate that Herman Miller and Steelcase reinvented office ergonomics on the west side of the state, or that Stryker is based in Kalamazoo. They became a global medical device powerhouse over the last couple of decades, too. Michigan's first unicorn, Duo Security, the two-factor authentication among many other things that they do there, was sold to Cisco in 2018 for 2.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, the first unicorn in the few years since we've had another 10 unicorns. And I think probably what would be surprising to a lot of people is it's in sectors well beyond mobility, it's marketplace like StockX, FinTech, logistics, cybersecurity, of course. It's a little bit of everything, and I think that goes to show that some of the fabric that exists within Michigan is a lot richer than what people think of, Motor City. We can scale software, we can scale life sciences innovation. It's not just metal bending, and I talked about re-industrialization earlier. So I think about where we are today, there's a hard tech renaissance and a broad portfolio of other high-growth sectors that Michigan's poised to do really well in, leveraging all of that industrial base that has been around for the last century. I'm just super excited about the future and where we can take things from here.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; I mean, genuinely, a really rich and diverse history of innovation that you've described there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; That's right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; And last year, when Michigan's Governor Whitmer announced this new initiative and your position, she noted the need to foster this sort of culture of innovation. And we hear that a lot that terminal in the context of company cultures. It's interesting to hear in the context of a U.S. state's economy. I wonder what your strategy is for building out this ecosystem, and how do you foster a state's innovation culture?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, it's an awesome point, and I think I mentioned earlier that I came into the role with this builder’s mentality. For me, this is how I am wired to think. This is how a lot of the companies and other founders that I spent a lot of time with, this is how they think. And so bringing this to the state government, I think of Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, their motto, the English translation at least of it, is “Step by Step, Ferociously.” And I think about that as a lot as a proxy for how I do that within the state government. There's a lot of iterative work that needs to happen, a lot of coaching and storytelling that happens to help folks understand how to think with that builder's mindset. The wonderful news is that when you start having that conversation, this is one of those in these complicated political times, this is a pretty bipartisan thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of how to build small businesses that create thriving main street communities while also supporting high-growth, high-tech startups that can drive prosperity for all, and population growth, while also being able to cover corporate innovation and technology transfer out of universities. All of these things touch every corner of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Michigan's a surprisingly large and very geographically diverse state. Most of the things that we tend to be known for outside the state are in a pretty small corner of Southeast Michigan. That's the Motor City part, but we do a lot and we have a lot of really interesting hubs for innovation and hubs for entrepreneurship, like I said, from the small mom-and-pop manufacturing shop or interest in clothing business all the way through to these insane life sciences innovations being spun out of the university. Being able to drive this culture of innovation ends up being applicable really across the board, and it just gets people really fired up when you start talking about this, fired up in a good way, which is, I think, what's really fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There's this notion of accelerating the talent flywheel and making sure that the state can invest in the cultivation of really rich communities and connections, and this founder culture. That stuff happens organically, generally, and when you talk about building startup ecosystems, it's not like the state shows up and says, "Now you're going to be more innovative and that works." That is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so to be able to develop those things, it's much more about this notion of ecosystem building and getting the ingredients and puzzle pieces in the right place, applying a little bit of funding here and there, or loosening a restriction here or there, and then letting the founders do what they do best, which is build. And so this is what I think I end up being super passionate about within the state. You can lead by example in a lot of these ways, and that flywheel that I mentioned really can get going in a beautiful way when you step out of the prescriptive innovation culture mindset.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; And given that role, I wonder what milestones the campaign has experienced in your first year? Could you share some highlights and some developing projects that you're really excited about?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; We had a recent one, I think that was pretty tremendous. Just a couple of months ago, Governor Whitmer signed into law a bipartisan legislation called the Michigan Innovation Fund. This was a multi-year effort that resulted in the state's biggest investment in the innovation ecosystem development in over two decades. A lot of this funding is going to early stage venture capital firms that will be able to support the broad seeding of new companies and ideas, keep talent within the state from some of those top tier research institutions, bring in really high quality companies that early stage, growth stage companies from out of state, and then develop or supercharge some of that innovation ecosystem fabric that ties those things together. So that connective tissue that I talked about, and that was an incredible win to launch the year with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was just back in January, and now we're working to get some of those funds out over the course of the next month or two so we can put them to use. What was really interesting about that was, it wasn't just a top-down thing. This was supported from the top all the way up to and including Governor Whitmer. I mentioned bipartisan support within Michigan's legislature and then bottom-up from all of the ecosystem partners, the founders, the investors advocating as a whole block, which I think is really powerful. Rather than trying to go for one-off things, this huge coalition of the willing got together organically and advocated for, hey, this is why this is such a great moment. This is the time to invest. And Governor Whitmer and the legislators, they heard that call, and we got something done, and so that happened relatively quickly. Like I said, biggest investment in the last two decades, and I think we're poised to have some really great successes in the coming year as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another really interesting one that I haven't seen other states do yet, Governor Whitmer, around a year ago, signed an executive order called the Infrastructure for Innovation. Essentially, what that does is it opens up state department and agency assets to startups in the name of moving the ball forward on innovation projects. And so if you're a startup and you need access to some very hard-to-find, very expensive, maybe like a test facility, you can use something that the state has, and all of the processes to get that done are streamlined so that you're not beating your head against a wall. Similarly, the universities and even federal labs and corporate resources, while an executive order can't compel those folks to do that, we've been finding tremendous buy-in from those stakeholders who want to volunteer access to their resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That does a lot of really good things, certainly for the founders, that provides them the launchpad that they need. But for those corporations and universities, and whatnot, a lot of them have these very expensive assets sitting around wildly underutilized, and they would be happy to have people come in and use them. That also gives them exposure to some of the bleeding-edge technology that a lot of these startups today are developing. I thought that was a really cool example of state government leadership using some of the tools that are available to a governor to get things moving. We've had a lot of early wins with startups here that have been able to leverage what that executive order was able to do for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we are talking about the MIT Technology Review to tie in an MIT piece here, we also started a Team Michigan for MIT's REAP program. It's the Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program, and this is one of the global thought leaders on best practices for innovation ecosystem development. And so we've got a cohort of about a dozen key leaders from across all of those different stakeholders who need to have a seat at the table for this ecosystem development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We go out to Cambridge twice a year for a multi-day workshop, and we get to talk about what we've learned as best practices, and then also learn from other cohorts from around the world on what they've done that is great. And then also get to hear some of the academic best practices that the MIT faculty have discovered as part of this area of expertise. And so that's been a very interesting way for us to be able to connect outside of the state government boundaries, if you will. You sort of get out there and see where the leading edge is and then come back and be able to talk about the things that we learned from all of these other global cohorts. So always important to be focused on best practices when you're trying to do new things, especially in government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Sounds like there are some really fantastic initiatives going on. It sounds like a very busy first year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; It's been a very busy first year couldn't be more thrilled about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. And in early 2023, I know that Newlab partnered with Michigan Central to establish a startup incubator too, which brought in more than a hundred startups just in its first 14 months. I wonder if you could talk a bit about how the incubator fits in with the statewide startup ecosystem and the importance of partnerships, too, for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben: &lt;/em&gt;Yeah, a key element, and I think the partnerships piece is essential here. Newlab is one of the larger components of the Southeast Michigan and especially the Detroit innovation ecosystem development. They will hit their two-year launch anniversary in just a couple of weeks, here I think. This will be mid-May, it will be two years and in that time, they've now got 140 plus startups all working out of their space, and Newlab they're actually headquartered in Brooklyn, New York, but they run this big startup accelerator incubator out of Detroit as well and so this is sort of their second flagship location. They've been a phenomenal partner, and so speaking of the partnerships, what do those do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They de-risk the technologies to help enable broader adoptions. Corporations can provide early revenues, the state can provide non-dilutive grant matching. Universities can bring IP and this renewable source of talent generation, and being able to stitch together all of those pieces can create some really interesting unlocks for startups to grow. But again, also this broader entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem to really be able to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newlab has been thrilled with their partnership in Southeast Michigan, and I think it's a model that can be tailored across the state so that, depending on what assets are available in your backyard, you can make sure that you can best harness those for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;Fantastic. What's the long-term vision for the state's innovation landscape when you think about it in five, 10 years from now? What do you envisage?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Amazing question. This is probably what I get most excited about. I think earlier we talked about the Willow Run B-24 bomber plant. That is what made Michigan known as the arsenal of democracy back in the day. I want Michigan to be the arsenal of innovation. We're not trying to recreate a Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley does certain things, not trying to recreate what El Segundo wants to do in hard tech or New York City in FinTech, and all of these other things. We want to develop the thing that makes the most sense for the ingredients that Michigan can bring to bear to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that becoming the Midwest arsenal of innovation, that's something that Michigan is very well poised to use as a springboard for the decades to come. I want us to be the default launch pad for building a hard tech company, a life sciences company, an agricultural tech company. You name it. If you've got a design prototype and want to mass produce something, don't want to hop coast, you want to be somewhere that has a tremendous quality of life, an affordable place, somewhere that government is at the table and willing to move fast, this is a place to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can be difficult to do in some of the more established ecosystems, especially post-covid, as a lot of them are going through really big transition periods. Michigan's already a top 10 state for business in the next 10 years. I want us to be a top 10 state for employment, top 10 state for household median income for post-secondary education attainment, and net talent migration. Those are my four top tens that I want to see in the next 10 years. And we covered a lot of topics today, but I think those are the reasons that I am super optimistic about being able to accomplish those.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. Well, I'm tempted to move to Michigan, so I'm sure plenty of other people will be now, too. Thank you so much, Ben. That was really fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben: &lt;/em&gt;Thanks, Megan. Really delighted to be here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;That was Ben Marchionna, chief innovation ecosystem officer at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, whom I spoke with from Brighton, England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That's it for this episode of Business Lab.

From creating the world’s largest airport factory during World War II at Willow Run to establishing the first successful polio vaccine trials in Ann Arbor to the invention of the snowboard in Muskegon, Michigan has a long history of turning innovation into lasting impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, with the creation of a new role, chief innovation ecosystem officer, at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), the state is doubling down on its ambition to become a modern engine of innovation, one that is both rooted in its industrial past and designed for the evolving demands of the 21st century economy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do you knit together risk capital founders, businesses, universities, and state government, all of the key stakeholders that need to be at the table together to build a more effective innovation ecosystem?” asks Ben Marchionna, the first to hold this groundbreaking new position.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leaning on his background in hard tech startups and national security, Marchionna aims to bring a “builder's thinking” to the state government. “I'm sort of wired for that—rapid prototyping, iterating, scaling, and driving that muscle into the state government ecosystem,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But these efforts aren’t about creating a copycat Silicon Valley. Michigan’s approach is uniquely its own. “We want to develop the thing that makes the most sense for the ingredients that Michigan can bring to bear to this challenge,” says Marchionna.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This includes cultivating both mom-and-pop businesses and tech unicorns, while tapping into the state’s talent, research, and manufacturing DNA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In an era where economic development often feels siloed, partisan, and reactive, Michigan is experimenting with a model centered on long-term value and community-oriented innovation. “You can lead by example in a lot of these ways, and that flywheel really can get going in a beautiful way when you step out of the prescriptive innovation culture mindset,” says Marchionna.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Transcript&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan Tatum:&lt;/em&gt; From MIT Technology Review. I'm Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's episode is brought to you in partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our topic today is building a statewide innovation economy. Now, the U.S. state of Michigan has long been recognized as a leader in vehicle and mobility innovation. Detroit put it on the map, but did you know it's also the birthplace of the snowboard or that the University of Michigan filed more than 600 invention disclosures in 2024, second only to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or that in the past five years, 40% of the largest global IPOs have been Michigan built companies?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two words for you: innovation ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My guest is Ben Marchionna, chief innovation ecosystem officer at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the MEDC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Ben, thank you ever so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben Marchionna:&lt;/em&gt; Thanks, Megan. Really pleased to be here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. And just to set some context to get us started, I wondered if we could take a kind of high-level look at the economic development landscape. I mean, you joined the MEDC team last year as Michigan's first chief innovation ecosystem officer. In fact, you were the first to hold such a role in the country, I believe. I wondered if you could talk a bit about your unique mission and how this economic development approach differs from efforts in other states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, sure would love to. Probably worth pointing out that while I've been in this role for about a year now, it was indeed a first-of-its-kind role in the state of Michigan and first of its kind in the country. The slight difference in the terminology, chief innovation ecosystem officer, it differs a little bit from what folks might think of as a chief innovation officer. I'm not all that focused on driving innovation within government, which is what some other chief innovation officers would be focused on around the country. Instead, you can think of my role as Michigan's chief architect for innovation, if you will. So, how do you knit together risk capital founders, businesses, universities, and state government, all of the key stakeholders that need to be at the table together to build a more effective innovation ecosystem? I talk a lot about building connective tissues that can achieve one plus one equals three outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michigan's got all kinds of really interesting ingredients and has the foundation to take advantage of the moment in a really interesting way over the next decades as we look to supercharge some of the growth of our innovation ecosystem development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My charter is relatively simple. It's to help make sure that Michigan wins in a now hyper-competitive global economy. And to do that, I end up being super focused on orienting us towards a growth and innovation-driven economy. That can mean a lot of different things, but I ultimately came to the MEDC and the role within the state with a builder's mindset. My background is not in traditional economic development, it's in not government at all. I spent the last 10 years building hard tech startups, one in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and another one in the Northern Virginia area. Before that, I spent a number of years at, think of it like, an innovation factory at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in the Mojave Desert, working on national security projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I'm sort of wired for that, builder's thinking, rapid prototyping, iterating, scaling, and driving that muscle into the state government ecosystem. I think it's important that the government also figure out how to pull out all the stops and be able to move at the speed that founders expect. A bias towards action, if you will. And so this is ultimately what my mission is. There are a lot of real interesting things that the state of Michigan can bring to bear to building our innovation ecosystem. And I think, tackling it with this sort of a mindset, I am absolutely optimistic for the future that we've got ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. It almost sounds like your role is sort of building a statewide startup incubator of sorts. As we mentioned in the opening, Michigan actually has a really interesting innovation history even in addition to the advances in the automotive industry. I wondered if you could talk a bit more about that history and why Michigan, in particular, is poised to support that sort of statewide startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, absolutely. And I would even broaden it. Building the startup ecosystem is one of the essential layers, but to be able to successfully do that, we have to bring in the research universities, we have to bring in the corporate innovation ecosystem, we have to bring in the risk capital, et cetera. So yes, absolutely, startups are important. And equally as important are all of these other elements that are necessary for a startup ecosystem to thrive, but are also the levers that are just sitting there waiting for us to pull them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we can get into some of the details over the course of our chat today on the auto industry and how this fits into it, but Michigan does a lot more than just automotive stuff. And you noted, I think, the surfboard as an example in the intro. Absolutely correct. We have a reputation as Motor City, but Michigan's innovation record is a lot weirder in a fun way and richer than just cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 20th century, mostly industrial moonshot innovation. So first paved mile of concrete was in Detroit in 1909. A few years later, this is when the auto sector started to really come about with Henry Ford's moving assembly line. Everyone tends to know about those details. But during World War II, Willow Run Airport sort of smack between Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan they had the biggest airplane factory in the world. They were cranking out B-24 bombers once every 63 minutes, and I've actually been to the office that Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh shared. It's still at the airport. And it was pretty cool because Henry Ford had a window built into the office that looked sort of around the corner so that he could tick off as airplanes rolled out of the hanger and make sure that they were following the same high rate production mentality that the auto sector was able to develop over the decades prior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And so they came in to help make sure that you could leverage that industrial sector to drive very rapid production, the at-scale mentality, which is also a really important part of the notion of re-industrialization that is taking hold across the country now. Happy to get into that a bit, but yeah, Willow Run, I don't think most folks realize that that was the biggest airplane factory in the world sitting right here in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all of this provided the mass production DNA that was able to help build the statewide supplier base. And today, yes, we use that for automotive, EVs, space hardware, batteries, you name it. But this is the foundation, I think, that we've got to be able to build on in the future. In the few decades since you saw innovations in sports, space, advanced materials, it's like the sixties to the eighties. You said the snowboard. That was invented in Muskegon on the west side of the state in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical's here in a really big way. They've pioneered silicone and advanced plastics in Michigan. University of Michigan's Dr. Thomas Francis is the world's first successful polio vaccine trials that were pioneered out of Ann Arbor, and that Big 10 research horsepower that we've got in the state, between the University of Michigan, Michigan State University. We also have Wayne State University in Detroit, which is a powerhouse. And then Michigan Tech University in the Upper Peninsula just recently became an R1 research institution, which essentially means those top-tier research powerhouses and that culture of tinkering matter a lot today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think in more recent history, you saw design and digital innovations emerge. I don't think a lot of people appreciate that Herman Miller and Steelcase reinvented office ergonomics on the west side of the state, or that Stryker is based in Kalamazoo. They became a global medical device powerhouse over the last couple of decades, too. Michigan's first unicorn, Duo Security, the two-factor authentication among many other things that they do there, was sold to Cisco in 2018 for 2.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, the first unicorn in the few years since we've had another 10 unicorns. And I think probably what would be surprising to a lot of people is it's in sectors well beyond mobility, it's marketplace like StockX, FinTech, logistics, cybersecurity, of course. It's a little bit of everything, and I think that goes to show that some of the fabric that exists within Michigan is a lot richer than what people think of, Motor City. We can scale software, we can scale life sciences innovation. It's not just metal bending, and I talked about re-industrialization earlier. So I think about where we are today, there's a hard tech renaissance and a broad portfolio of other high-growth sectors that Michigan's poised to do really well in, leveraging all of that industrial base that has been around for the last century. I'm just super excited about the future and where we can take things from here.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; I mean, genuinely, a really rich and diverse history of innovation that you've described there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; That's right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; And last year, when Michigan's Governor Whitmer announced this new initiative and your position, she noted the need to foster this sort of culture of innovation. And we hear that a lot that terminal in the context of company cultures. It's interesting to hear in the context of a U.S. state's economy. I wonder what your strategy is for building out this ecosystem, and how do you foster a state's innovation culture?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, it's an awesome point, and I think I mentioned earlier that I came into the role with this builder’s mentality. For me, this is how I am wired to think. This is how a lot of the companies and other founders that I spent a lot of time with, this is how they think. And so bringing this to the state government, I think of Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, their motto, the English translation at least of it, is “Step by Step, Ferociously.” And I think about that as a lot as a proxy for how I do that within the state government. There's a lot of iterative work that needs to happen, a lot of coaching and storytelling that happens to help folks understand how to think with that builder's mindset. The wonderful news is that when you start having that conversation, this is one of those in these complicated political times, this is a pretty bipartisan thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of how to build small businesses that create thriving main street communities while also supporting high-growth, high-tech startups that can drive prosperity for all, and population growth, while also being able to cover corporate innovation and technology transfer out of universities. All of these things touch every corner of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Michigan's a surprisingly large and very geographically diverse state. Most of the things that we tend to be known for outside the state are in a pretty small corner of Southeast Michigan. That's the Motor City part, but we do a lot and we have a lot of really interesting hubs for innovation and hubs for entrepreneurship, like I said, from the small mom-and-pop manufacturing shop or interest in clothing business all the way through to these insane life sciences innovations being spun out of the university. Being able to drive this culture of innovation ends up being applicable really across the board, and it just gets people really fired up when you start talking about this, fired up in a good way, which is, I think, what's really fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There's this notion of accelerating the talent flywheel and making sure that the state can invest in the cultivation of really rich communities and connections, and this founder culture. That stuff happens organically, generally, and when you talk about building startup ecosystems, it's not like the state shows up and says, "Now you're going to be more innovative and that works." That is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so to be able to develop those things, it's much more about this notion of ecosystem building and getting the ingredients and puzzle pieces in the right place, applying a little bit of funding here and there, or loosening a restriction here or there, and then letting the founders do what they do best, which is build. And so this is what I think I end up being super passionate about within the state. You can lead by example in a lot of these ways, and that flywheel that I mentioned really can get going in a beautiful way when you step out of the prescriptive innovation culture mindset.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; And given that role, I wonder what milestones the campaign has experienced in your first year? Could you share some highlights and some developing projects that you're really excited about?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; We had a recent one, I think that was pretty tremendous. Just a couple of months ago, Governor Whitmer signed into law a bipartisan legislation called the Michigan Innovation Fund. This was a multi-year effort that resulted in the state's biggest investment in the innovation ecosystem development in over two decades. A lot of this funding is going to early stage venture capital firms that will be able to support the broad seeding of new companies and ideas, keep talent within the state from some of those top tier research institutions, bring in really high quality companies that early stage, growth stage companies from out of state, and then develop or supercharge some of that innovation ecosystem fabric that ties those things together. So that connective tissue that I talked about, and that was an incredible win to launch the year with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was just back in January, and now we're working to get some of those funds out over the course of the next month or two so we can put them to use. What was really interesting about that was, it wasn't just a top-down thing. This was supported from the top all the way up to and including Governor Whitmer. I mentioned bipartisan support within Michigan's legislature and then bottom-up from all of the ecosystem partners, the founders, the investors advocating as a whole block, which I think is really powerful. Rather than trying to go for one-off things, this huge coalition of the willing got together organically and advocated for, hey, this is why this is such a great moment. This is the time to invest. And Governor Whitmer and the legislators, they heard that call, and we got something done, and so that happened relatively quickly. Like I said, biggest investment in the last two decades, and I think we're poised to have some really great successes in the coming year as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another really interesting one that I haven't seen other states do yet, Governor Whitmer, around a year ago, signed an executive order called the Infrastructure for Innovation. Essentially, what that does is it opens up state department and agency assets to startups in the name of moving the ball forward on innovation projects. And so if you're a startup and you need access to some very hard-to-find, very expensive, maybe like a test facility, you can use something that the state has, and all of the processes to get that done are streamlined so that you're not beating your head against a wall. Similarly, the universities and even federal labs and corporate resources, while an executive order can't compel those folks to do that, we've been finding tremendous buy-in from those stakeholders who want to volunteer access to their resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That does a lot of really good things, certainly for the founders, that provides them the launchpad that they need. But for those corporations and universities, and whatnot, a lot of them have these very expensive assets sitting around wildly underutilized, and they would be happy to have people come in and use them. That also gives them exposure to some of the bleeding-edge technology that a lot of these startups today are developing. I thought that was a really cool example of state government leadership using some of the tools that are available to a governor to get things moving. We've had a lot of early wins with startups here that have been able to leverage what that executive order was able to do for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we are talking about the MIT Technology Review to tie in an MIT piece here, we also started a Team Michigan for MIT's REAP program. It's the Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program, and this is one of the global thought leaders on best practices for innovation ecosystem development. And so we've got a cohort of about a dozen key leaders from across all of those different stakeholders who need to have a seat at the table for this ecosystem development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We go out to Cambridge twice a year for a multi-day workshop, and we get to talk about what we've learned as best practices, and then also learn from other cohorts from around the world on what they've done that is great. And then also get to hear some of the academic best practices that the MIT faculty have discovered as part of this area of expertise. And so that's been a very interesting way for us to be able to connect outside of the state government boundaries, if you will. You sort of get out there and see where the leading edge is and then come back and be able to talk about the things that we learned from all of these other global cohorts. So always important to be focused on best practices when you're trying to do new things, especially in government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Sounds like there are some really fantastic initiatives going on. It sounds like a very busy first year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; It's been a very busy first year couldn't be more thrilled about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. And in early 2023, I know that Newlab partnered with Michigan Central to establish a startup incubator too, which brought in more than a hundred startups just in its first 14 months. I wonder if you could talk a bit about how the incubator fits in with the statewide startup ecosystem and the importance of partnerships, too, for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben: &lt;/em&gt;Yeah, a key element, and I think the partnerships piece is essential here. Newlab is one of the larger components of the Southeast Michigan and especially the Detroit innovation ecosystem development. They will hit their two-year launch anniversary in just a couple of weeks, here I think. This will be mid-May, it will be two years and in that time, they've now got 140 plus startups all working out of their space, and Newlab they're actually headquartered in Brooklyn, New York, but they run this big startup accelerator incubator out of Detroit as well and so this is sort of their second flagship location. They've been a phenomenal partner, and so speaking of the partnerships, what do those do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They de-risk the technologies to help enable broader adoptions. Corporations can provide early revenues, the state can provide non-dilutive grant matching. Universities can bring IP and this renewable source of talent generation, and being able to stitch together all of those pieces can create some really interesting unlocks for startups to grow. But again, also this broader entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem to really be able to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newlab has been thrilled with their partnership in Southeast Michigan, and I think it's a model that can be tailored across the state so that, depending on what assets are available in your backyard, you can make sure that you can best harness those for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;Fantastic. What's the long-term vision for the state's innovation landscape when you think about it in five, 10 years from now? What do you envisage?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben:&lt;/em&gt; Amazing question. This is probably what I get most excited about. I think earlier we talked about the Willow Run B-24 bomber plant. That is what made Michigan known as the arsenal of democracy back in the day. I want Michigan to be the arsenal of innovation. We're not trying to recreate a Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley does certain things, not trying to recreate what El Segundo wants to do in hard tech or New York City in FinTech, and all of these other things. We want to develop the thing that makes the most sense for the ingredients that Michigan can bring to bear to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that becoming the Midwest arsenal of innovation, that's something that Michigan is very well poised to use as a springboard for the decades to come. I want us to be the default launch pad for building a hard tech company, a life sciences company, an agricultural tech company. You name it. If you've got a design prototype and want to mass produce something, don't want to hop coast, you want to be somewhere that has a tremendous quality of life, an affordable place, somewhere that government is at the table and willing to move fast, this is a place to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can be difficult to do in some of the more established ecosystems, especially post-covid, as a lot of them are going through really big transition periods. Michigan's already a top 10 state for business in the next 10 years. I want us to be a top 10 state for employment, top 10 state for household median income for post-secondary education attainment, and net talent migration. Those are my four top tens that I want to see in the next 10 years. And we covered a lot of topics today, but I think those are the reasons that I am super optimistic about being able to accomplish those.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan:&lt;/em&gt; Fantastic. Well, I'm tempted to move to Michigan, so I'm sure plenty of other people will be now, too. Thank you so much, Ben. That was really fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben: &lt;/em&gt;Thanks, Megan. Really delighted to be here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megan: &lt;/em&gt;That was Ben Marchionna, chief innovation ecosystem officer at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, whom I spoke with from Brighton, England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That's it for this episode of Business Lab.

That’s why the company on Tuesday opened up its “3D-aware” model to the public, promising a “hybrid” approach that gives filmmakers more control than other standard text-to-video models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moonvalley first launched its model, named Marey, in beta in March, and has now released it as a monthly credits-based subscription. Users can pay $14.99 for 100 credits, $34.99 for 250 credits, and $149.99 for 1,000 credits. Users can generate clips up to five seconds long, which is in line with industry standards for publicly available video generation models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup, co-founded by former DeepMind researchers who worked on Google’s own video generation model, claims Marey is one of the few models trained entirely on openly licensed data. That fits neatly with Moonvalley’s target customers: filmmakers who want to avoid future lawsuits over AI-generated content that might resemble copyrighted material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For independent filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, Marey’s biggest selling point is that it democratizes access to the top AI storytelling tools, especially for people who have long felt shut out of traditional filmmaking.&amp;nbsp;Growing up in Puerto Rico, Soto said you’d first need to scrape together hundreds or thousands of dollars just to rent cameras to make a film.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Back home, we needed to ask for permission to tell our stories,” he said. “AI gives you the ability to do it on your own terms without having to say no to your dreams because someone refused to finance it, because they didn’t think a story from your country could return a profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Soto says, Marey has helped him cut production costs by 20% to 40% and work more freely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soto previously worked with Moonvalley’s studio, Asteria, on the HBO docuseries, “Menudo: Forever Young.” Asteria, also known as XTR, was acquired this year by Moonvalley, according to Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. (GC was a major shareholder in Asteria, and invested more money into the combined entity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marey-s-hybrid-filmmaking-approach"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marey’s &lt;/strong&gt;‘hybrid filmmaking’ approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3025517" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MotionTransfer3.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Moonvalley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moonvalley CEO and co-founder Naeem Talukdar demonstrated for TechCrunch how Marey could be used in pre- and post-production, be it for testing scenes before shooting or adjusting camera angles after the fact, and how it can control objects, characters, motion, and scene composition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Talukdar told TechCrunch that Marey has an understanding of the physical world that could translate to more interactive storytelling as the tech develops. Right now, that sort of understanding — which Marey shares with other models like Google’s Veo 3 and OpenAI’s still-private Sora — allows Marey to do things like mimic motion while still respecting the laws of physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, a video of a bison sprinting through grasslands can be translated into a Cadillac racing through the same environment, with the grass and dirt responding to the car’s movement. Or, Marey can superimpose a character that looks like George Washington onto an actor, translating everything from the actor’s facial movements to the muscles in his forearms as he gesticulates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perhaps more unique is Marey’s support for free camera motion. Talukdar showed off how it lets you shift the camera trajectory with your mouse: he integrated a pan and slide zoom to a video of a woman on a train in the Rockies by simply dragging his cursor. He also noted that Marey could achieve near-360-degree camera motion, and obey instructions to create footage as if it was shot from a handheld camera or dolly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Marey can also change the background of videos, allowing filmmakers to start with source footage to build the scene they want. Talukdar played a video of a man riding a motorcycle on a suburban road, which then evolved to the same man, sans helmet, riding a slightly different bike on a country highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Moonvalley’s plan over the next few months is to roll out new controls like lighting, deep object trajectories, and character libraries, said Talukdar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Marey’s public release puts it in direct rivalry with a growing field of AI video generators – models like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, Pika, and Haiper.&lt;/p&gt;

Ruoming Pang, the executive who oversaw Apple Intelligence, has jumped ship to join Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pang wasn’t just any Apple employee. He led a 100-strong army of engineers crafting the language models that make your iPhone summarise texts, generate those Genmoji, and prioritise your notifications. Now he’s traded the Apple Park spaceship for Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters, becoming the latest big name to answer Mark Zuckerberg’s call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading exec’s departure is a gut punch to a company that’s been scrambling to prove it can play in the AI big leagues. The timing couldn’t be worse, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last month, Pang’s right-hand man, Tom Gunter, had already packed his bags and left.

Ruoming Pang, the executive who oversaw Apple Intelligence, has jumped ship to join Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pang wasn’t just any Apple employee. He led a 100-strong army of engineers crafting the language models that make your iPhone summarise texts, generate those Genmoji, and prioritise your notifications. Now he’s traded the Apple Park spaceship for Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters, becoming the latest big name to answer Mark Zuckerberg’s call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading exec’s departure is a gut punch to a company that’s been scrambling to prove it can play in the AI big leagues. The timing couldn’t be worse, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last month, Pang’s right-hand man, Tom Gunter, had already packed his bags and left.

One of the most compelling conversations on one of the AI Stages will feature a panel of innovators redefining what intelligent systems can do. Among them is Alex Kendall, co-founder and CEO of Wayve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Alex Kendall" class="wp-image-3025421" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TC25_-Alex-Kendall-Speaker-16x9-Dark.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-research-breakthrough-to-real-world-autonomy"&gt;From research breakthrough to real-world autonomy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kendall founded Wayve in 2017 with a bold vision: to unlock autonomous mobility, not through handcrafted rules but through embodied intelligence. His pioneering research at the University of Cambridge laid the foundation for a new generation of self-driving systems powered by deep learning and computer vision. Under his leadership, Wayve became the first to prove that a machine could learn to interpret its surroundings and make real-time driving decisions — without relying on traditional maps or manual coding.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Kendall is leading the charge toward AV2.0, an entirely new architecture for autonomous vehicles that is designed to scale globally. As CEO, he focuses on aligning strategy, research, partnerships, and commercialization to bring intelligent driving systems to the road. With a PhD in computer vision and robotics, award-winning academic work, and recognition on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, Kendall is a rare blend of scientist, founder, and industry operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-expect-on-the-ai-stage"&gt;What to expect on the AI Stage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While full panel details are still under wraps, Kendall’s participation ensures that this session will offer more than just theoretical takes. Expect insights on how embodied intelligence can shift the trajectory of AI, the challenges of building systems that adapt to the real world, and what it takes to commercialize autonomy at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is an AI system intelligent enough to be called artificial general intelligence (AGI)? According to one definition reportedly agreed upon by Microsoft and OpenAI, the answer lies in economics: When AI generates $100 billion in profits. This arbitrary profit-based benchmark for AGI perfectly captures the definitional chaos plaguing the AI industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it may be impossible to create a universal definition of AGI, but few people with money on the line will admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this past year, several high-profile people in the tech industry have been heralding the seemingly imminent arrival of "AGI" (i.e., within the next two years). But there's a huge problem: Few people agree on exactly what AGI means. As Google DeepMind wrote in a paper on the topic: If you ask 100 AI experts to define AGI, you'll get "100 related but different definitions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just academic navel-gazing. The definition problem has real consequences for how we develop, regulate, and think about AI systems. When companies claim they're on the verge of AGI, what exactly are they claiming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to define AGI in a traditional way that hearkens back to the "general" part of its name: An AI model that can widely generalize—applying concepts to novel scenarios—and match the versatile human capability to perform unfamiliar tasks across many domains without needing to be specifically trained for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this definition immediately runs into thorny questions about what exactly constitutes "human-level" performance. Expert-level humans? Average humans? And across which tasks—should an AGI be able to perform surgery, write poetry, fix a car engine, and prove mathematical theorems, all at the level of human specialists? (Which human can do all that?) More fundamentally, the focus on human parity is itself an assumption; it's worth asking why mimicking human intelligence is the necessary yardstick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of trouble resulting from this definitional confusion comes from the deteriorating relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI. According to The Wall Street Journal, the two companies are now locked in acrimonious negotiations partly because they can't agree on what AGI even means—despite having baked the term into a contract worth over $13 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of moving goalposts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term artificial general intelligence has murky origins. While John McCarthy and colleagues coined the term artificial intelligence at Dartmouth College in 1956, AGI emerged much later. Physicist Mark Gubrud first used the term in 1997, though it was computer scientist Shane Legg and AI researcher Ben Goertzel who independently reintroduced it around 2002, with the modern usage popularized by a 2007 book edited by Goertzel and Cassio Pennachin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early AI researchers envisioned systems that could match human capability across all domains. In 1965, AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon predicted that "machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do." But as robotics lagged behind computing advances, the definition narrowed. The goalposts shifted, partly as a practical response to this uneven progress, from "do everything a human can do" to "do most economically valuable tasks" to today's even fuzzier standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the Turing Test served as the de facto benchmark for machine intelligence. If a computer could fool a human judge into thinking it was human through text conversation, the test surmised, then it had achieved something like human intelligence. But the Turing Test has shown its age. Modern language models can pass some limited versions of the test not because they "think" like humans, but because they're exceptionally capable at creating highly plausible human-sounding outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current landscape of AGI definitions reveals just how fractured the concept has become. OpenAI's charter defines AGI as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"—a definition that, like the profit metric, relies on economic progress as a substitute for measuring cognition in a concrete way. Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge that he does not have a "one-sentence, pithy definition" of the concept. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes that his company now knows how to build AGI "as we have traditionally understood it." Meanwhile, former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever reportedly treated AGI as something almost mystical—according to a 2023 Atlantic report, he would lead employees in chants of "Feel the AGI!" during company meetings, treating the concept more like a spiritual quest than a technical milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, takes an even more skeptical stance on the terminology itself. In his October 2024 essay "Machines of Loving Grace," Amodei writes that he finds "AGI to be an imprecise term that has gathered a lot of sci-fi baggage and hype." Instead, he prefers terms like "powerful AI" or "Expert-Level Science and Engineering," which he argues better capture the capabilities without the associated hype. When Amodei describes what others might call AGI, he frames it as an AI system "smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields" that can work autonomously on tasks taking hours, days, or weeks to complete—essentially "a country of geniuses in a data center." His resistance to AGI terminology adds another layer to the definitional chaos: Not only do we not agree on what AGI means, but some leading AI developers reject the term entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most systematic attempt to bring order to this chaos comes from Google DeepMind, which in July 2024 proposed a framework with five levels of AGI performance: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. DeepMind researchers argued that no level beyond "emerging AGI" existed at that time. Under their system, today's most capable LLMs and simulated reasoning models still qualify as "emerging AGI"—equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human at various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this framework has its critics. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the nonprofit AI Now Institute, told TechCrunch that she thinks the concept of AGI is too ill-defined to be "rigorously evaluated scientifically." In fact, with so many varied definitions at play, one could argue that the term AGI&amp;nbsp;has become technically meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When philosophy meets contract law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-OpenAI dispute illustrates what happens when philosophical speculation is turned into legal obligations. When the companies signed their partnership agreement, they included a clause stating that when OpenAI achieves AGI, it can limit Microsoft's access to future technology. According to The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI executives believe they're close to declaring AGI, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, on the Dwarkesh Patel podcast in February, has called the idea of using AGI as a self-proclaimed milestone "nonsensical benchmark hacking."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reported $100 billion profit threshold we mentioned earlier conflates commercial success with cognitive capability, as if a system's ability to generate revenue says anything meaningful about whether it can "think," "reason," or "understand" the world like a human.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your definition, we may already have AGI, or it may be physically impossible to achieve. If you define AGI as "AI that performs better than most humans at most tasks," then current language models potentially meet that bar for certain types of work (which tasks, which humans, what is "better"?), but agreement on whether that is true is far from universal. This says nothing of the even murkier concept of "superintelligence"—another nebulous term for a hypothetical, god-like intellect so far beyond human cognition that, like AGI, it defies any solid definition or benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this definitional chaos, researchers have tried to create objective benchmarks to measure progress toward AGI, but these attempts have revealed their own set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why benchmarks keep failing us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for better AGI benchmarks has produced some interesting alternatives to the Turing Test. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019 by François Chollet, tests whether AI systems can solve novel visual puzzles that require deep and novel analytical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost all current AI benchmarks can be solved purely via memorization," Chollet told Freethink in August 2024. A major problem with AI benchmarks currently stems from data contamination—when test questions end up in training data, models can appear to perform well without truly "understanding" the underlying concepts. Large language models serve as master imitators, mimicking patterns found in training data, but not always originating novel solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even sophisticated benchmarks like ARC-AGI face a fundamental problem: They're still trying to reduce intelligence to a score. And while improved benchmarks are essential for measuring empirical progress in a scientific framework, intelligence isn't a single thing you can measure, like height or weight—it's a complex constellation of abilities that manifest differently in different contexts. Indeed, we don't even have a complete functional definition of human intelligence, so defining artificial intelligence by any single benchmark score is likely to capture only a small part of the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The survey says: AGI may not be imminent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the field of AI has seen rapid, tangible progress in numerous fields, including computer vision, protein folding, and translation. Some excitement of progress is justified, but it's important not to oversell an AI model's capabilities prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hype from some in the industry, many AI researchers remain skeptical that AGI is just around the corner. A March 2025 survey of AI researchers conducted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) found that a majority (76 percent) of researchers who participated in the survey believed that scaling up current approaches is "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to achieve AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such expert predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, as researchers have consistently been surprised by the rapid pace of AI capability advancement. A 2024 survey by Grace et al. of 2,778 AI researchers found that experts had dramatically shortened their timelines for AI milestones after being surprised by progress in 2022–2023. The median forecast for when AI could outperform humans in every possible task jumped forward by 13 years, from 2060 in their 2022 survey to 2047 in 2023. This pattern of underestimation was evident across multiple benchmarks, with many researchers' predictions about AI capabilities being proven wrong within months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, as the tech landscape shifts, the AI goalposts continue to recede at a constant speed. Recently, as more studies continue to reveal limitations in simulated reasoning models, some experts in the industry have been slowly backing away from claims of imminent AGI. For example, AI podcast host Dwarkesh Patel recently published a blog post arguing that developing AGI still faces major bottlenecks, particularly in continual learning, and predicted we're still seven years away from AI that can learn on the job as seamlessly as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the definition matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect we've seen above between researcher consensus, firm terminology definitions, and corporate rhetoric has a real impact. When policymakers act as if AGI is imminent based on hype rather than scientific evidence, they risk making decisions that don't match reality. When companies write contracts around undefined terms, they may create legal time bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The definitional chaos around AGI isn't just philosophical hand-wringing. Companies use promises of impending AGI to attract investment, talent, and customers. Governments craft policy based on AGI timelines. The public forms potentially unrealistic expectations about AI's impact on jobs and society based on these fuzzy concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without clear definitions, we can't have meaningful conversations about AI misapplications, regulation, or development priorities. We end up talking past each other, with optimists and pessimists using the same words to mean fundamentally different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of this kind of challenge, some may be tempted to give up on formal definitions entirely, falling back on an "I'll know it when I see it" approach for AGI—echoing Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous quote about obscenity. This subjective standard might feel useful, but it's useless for contracts, regulation, or scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's time to move beyond the term AGI. Instead of chasing an ill-defined goal that keeps receding into the future, we could focus on specific capabilities: Can this system learn new tasks without extensive retraining? Can it explain its outputs? Can it produce safe outputs that don't harm or mislead people? These questions tell us more about AI progress than any amount of AGI speculation. The most useful way forward may be to think of progress in AI as a multidimensional spectrum without a specific threshold of achievement. But charting that spectrum will demand new benchmarks that don’t yet exist—and a firm, empirical definition of "intelligence" that remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is an AI system intelligent enough to be called artificial general intelligence (AGI)? According to one definition reportedly agreed upon by Microsoft and OpenAI, the answer lies in economics: When AI generates $100 billion in profits. This arbitrary profit-based benchmark for AGI perfectly captures the definitional chaos plaguing the AI industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it may be impossible to create a universal definition of AGI, but few people with money on the line will admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this past year, several high-profile people in the tech industry have been heralding the seemingly imminent arrival of "AGI" (i.e., within the next two years). But there's a huge problem: Few people agree on exactly what AGI means. As Google DeepMind wrote in a paper on the topic: If you ask 100 AI experts to define AGI, you'll get "100 related but different definitions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just academic navel-gazing. The definition problem has real consequences for how we develop, regulate, and think about AI systems. When companies claim they're on the verge of AGI, what exactly are they claiming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to define AGI in a traditional way that hearkens back to the "general" part of its name: An AI model that can widely generalize—applying concepts to novel scenarios—and match the versatile human capability to perform unfamiliar tasks across many domains without needing to be specifically trained for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this definition immediately runs into thorny questions about what exactly constitutes "human-level" performance. Expert-level humans? Average humans? And across which tasks—should an AGI be able to perform surgery, write poetry, fix a car engine, and prove mathematical theorems, all at the level of human specialists? (Which human can do all that?) More fundamentally, the focus on human parity is itself an assumption; it's worth asking why mimicking human intelligence is the necessary yardstick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of trouble resulting from this definitional confusion comes from the deteriorating relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI. According to The Wall Street Journal, the two companies are now locked in acrimonious negotiations partly because they can't agree on what AGI even means—despite having baked the term into a contract worth over $13 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of moving goalposts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term artificial general intelligence has murky origins. While John McCarthy and colleagues coined the term artificial intelligence at Dartmouth College in 1956, AGI emerged much later. Physicist Mark Gubrud first used the term in 1997, though it was computer scientist Shane Legg and AI researcher Ben Goertzel who independently reintroduced it around 2002, with the modern usage popularized by a 2007 book edited by Goertzel and Cassio Pennachin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early AI researchers envisioned systems that could match human capability across all domains. In 1965, AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon predicted that "machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do." But as robotics lagged behind computing advances, the definition narrowed. The goalposts shifted, partly as a practical response to this uneven progress, from "do everything a human can do" to "do most economically valuable tasks" to today's even fuzzier standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the Turing Test served as the de facto benchmark for machine intelligence. If a computer could fool a human judge into thinking it was human through text conversation, the test surmised, then it had achieved something like human intelligence. But the Turing Test has shown its age. Modern language models can pass some limited versions of the test not because they "think" like humans, but because they're exceptionally capable at creating highly plausible human-sounding outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current landscape of AGI definitions reveals just how fractured the concept has become. OpenAI's charter defines AGI as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"—a definition that, like the profit metric, relies on economic progress as a substitute for measuring cognition in a concrete way. Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge that he does not have a "one-sentence, pithy definition" of the concept. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes that his company now knows how to build AGI "as we have traditionally understood it." Meanwhile, former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever reportedly treated AGI as something almost mystical—according to a 2023 Atlantic report, he would lead employees in chants of "Feel the AGI!" during company meetings, treating the concept more like a spiritual quest than a technical milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, takes an even more skeptical stance on the terminology itself. In his October 2024 essay "Machines of Loving Grace," Amodei writes that he finds "AGI to be an imprecise term that has gathered a lot of sci-fi baggage and hype." Instead, he prefers terms like "powerful AI" or "Expert-Level Science and Engineering," which he argues better capture the capabilities without the associated hype. When Amodei describes what others might call AGI, he frames it as an AI system "smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields" that can work autonomously on tasks taking hours, days, or weeks to complete—essentially "a country of geniuses in a data center." His resistance to AGI terminology adds another layer to the definitional chaos: Not only do we not agree on what AGI means, but some leading AI developers reject the term entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most systematic attempt to bring order to this chaos comes from Google DeepMind, which in July 2024 proposed a framework with five levels of AGI performance: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. DeepMind researchers argued that no level beyond "emerging AGI" existed at that time. Under their system, today's most capable LLMs and simulated reasoning models still qualify as "emerging AGI"—equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human at various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this framework has its critics. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the nonprofit AI Now Institute, told TechCrunch that she thinks the concept of AGI is too ill-defined to be "rigorously evaluated scientifically." In fact, with so many varied definitions at play, one could argue that the term AGI&amp;nbsp;has become technically meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When philosophy meets contract law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-OpenAI dispute illustrates what happens when philosophical speculation is turned into legal obligations. When the companies signed their partnership agreement, they included a clause stating that when OpenAI achieves AGI, it can limit Microsoft's access to future technology. According to The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI executives believe they're close to declaring AGI, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, on the Dwarkesh Patel podcast in February, has called the idea of using AGI as a self-proclaimed milestone "nonsensical benchmark hacking."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reported $100 billion profit threshold we mentioned earlier conflates commercial success with cognitive capability, as if a system's ability to generate revenue says anything meaningful about whether it can "think," "reason," or "understand" the world like a human.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your definition, we may already have AGI, or it may be physically impossible to achieve. If you define AGI as "AI that performs better than most humans at most tasks," then current language models potentially meet that bar for certain types of work (which tasks, which humans, what is "better"?), but agreement on whether that is true is far from universal. This says nothing of the even murkier concept of "superintelligence"—another nebulous term for a hypothetical, god-like intellect so far beyond human cognition that, like AGI, it defies any solid definition or benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this definitional chaos, researchers have tried to create objective benchmarks to measure progress toward AGI, but these attempts have revealed their own set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why benchmarks keep failing us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for better AGI benchmarks has produced some interesting alternatives to the Turing Test. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019 by François Chollet, tests whether AI systems can solve novel visual puzzles that require deep and novel analytical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost all current AI benchmarks can be solved purely via memorization," Chollet told Freethink in August 2024. A major problem with AI benchmarks currently stems from data contamination—when test questions end up in training data, models can appear to perform well without truly "understanding" the underlying concepts. Large language models serve as master imitators, mimicking patterns found in training data, but not always originating novel solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even sophisticated benchmarks like ARC-AGI face a fundamental problem: They're still trying to reduce intelligence to a score. And while improved benchmarks are essential for measuring empirical progress in a scientific framework, intelligence isn't a single thing you can measure, like height or weight—it's a complex constellation of abilities that manifest differently in different contexts. Indeed, we don't even have a complete functional definition of human intelligence, so defining artificial intelligence by any single benchmark score is likely to capture only a small part of the complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The survey says: AGI may not be imminent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the field of AI has seen rapid, tangible progress in numerous fields, including computer vision, protein folding, and translation. Some excitement of progress is justified, but it's important not to oversell an AI model's capabilities prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hype from some in the industry, many AI researchers remain skeptical that AGI is just around the corner. A March 2025 survey of AI researchers conducted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) found that a majority (76 percent) of researchers who participated in the survey believed that scaling up current approaches is "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to achieve AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such expert predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, as researchers have consistently been surprised by the rapid pace of AI capability advancement. A 2024 survey by Grace et al. of 2,778 AI researchers found that experts had dramatically shortened their timelines for AI milestones after being surprised by progress in 2022–2023. The median forecast for when AI could outperform humans in every possible task jumped forward by 13 years, from 2060 in their 2022 survey to 2047 in 2023. This pattern of underestimation was evident across multiple benchmarks, with many researchers' predictions about AI capabilities being proven wrong within months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, as the tech landscape shifts, the AI goalposts continue to recede at a constant speed. Recently, as more studies continue to reveal limitations in simulated reasoning models, some experts in the industry have been slowly backing away from claims of imminent AGI. For example, AI podcast host Dwarkesh Patel recently published a blog post arguing that developing AGI still faces major bottlenecks, particularly in continual learning, and predicted we're still seven years away from AI that can learn on the job as seamlessly as humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the definition matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect we've seen above between researcher consensus, firm terminology definitions, and corporate rhetoric has a real impact. When policymakers act as if AGI is imminent based on hype rather than scientific evidence, they risk making decisions that don't match reality. When companies write contracts around undefined terms, they may create legal time bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The definitional chaos around AGI isn't just philosophical hand-wringing. Companies use promises of impending AGI to attract investment, talent, and customers. Governments craft policy based on AGI timelines. The public forms potentially unrealistic expectations about AI's impact on jobs and society based on these fuzzy concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without clear definitions, we can't have meaningful conversations about AI misapplications, regulation, or development priorities. We end up talking past each other, with optimists and pessimists using the same words to mean fundamentally different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of this kind of challenge, some may be tempted to give up on formal definitions entirely, falling back on an "I'll know it when I see it" approach for AGI—echoing Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous quote about obscenity. This subjective standard might feel useful, but it's useless for contracts, regulation, or scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's time to move beyond the term AGI. Instead of chasing an ill-defined goal that keeps receding into the future, we could focus on specific capabilities: Can this system learn new tasks without extensive retraining? Can it explain its outputs? Can it produce safe outputs that don't harm or mislead people? These questions tell us more about AI progress than any amount of AGI speculation. The most useful way forward may be to think of progress in AI as a multidimensional spectrum without a specific threshold of achievement. But charting that spectrum will demand new benchmarks that don’t yet exist—and a firm, empirical definition of "intelligence" that remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Replit will become available through Microsoft’s enterprise cloud app store, Azure Marketplace,&amp;nbsp;meaning Microsoft shops will be able to purchase Replit subscriptions there. Replit is also integrating its tech with a number of Microsoft cloud services like containers, virtual machines, and Microsoft’s version of Postgres — the database that Replit supports —&amp;nbsp;called Neon Serverless Postgres. That means that Azure should generate its share of revenue from Replit apps that are used in production.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft famously offers its own hugely popular vibe coder with Github Copilot, but Replit doesn’t really compete with it too much as they are geared toward different users and somewhat different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Copilot competes with Anysphere’s Cursor as an AI-powered, in-browser coding assistant used by programmers. Replit is popular with programmers, but it can also be used by people with little coding experience. Its users create web apps through natural language prompts, and Replit does the rest: setting up the database, the authentication, the storage, etc. Those with programming experience can then customize features directly, as Replit supports a number of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In this case, the two companies are marketing this offering as a prototyping/designing tool, like a competitor to Figma. The companies are also aiming it at non-programmer business managers for build-it-yourself apps. For example, a sales manager could use it to build a tool that tracks correlations between contract renewals and customer support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are enabling all employees across all functions to develop apps, regardless of coding experience, so we are complimentary to Copilot from that perspective,” a Replit spokesperson told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Replit is also one of the breakout stars of the vibe coding world. In June, CEO Amjad Masad tweeted that in six months, the company went from $10 million in annual recurring revenue to $100 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It last raised $97.4 million — led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Khosla, Coatue, SV Angel, Y Combinator, Bloomberg Beta, Naval Ravikant, and ARK Ventures — at a $1.1 post-money valuation. Masad said in June that it hasn’t needed to raise since: “We still have over half our funding in the bank.” The startup claims that over 500,000 business users are on its platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Replit competes with a few other fast-growing startups, including European darling Lovable, which hit $50 million ARR around the same time period, its CEO said, and is reportedly in the process of raising a new round at around a $2B valuation; and Bolt, which grew to about $40 million ARR in about five months as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If there is any competitor taking an L from this partnership, it’s Google Cloud: The apps built and run through Replit are typically hosted on Google Cloud. In fact, Replit has been such a feather in Google’s cap, that the cloud giant has profiled the partnership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, this deal is non-exclusive, Replit confirmed to TechCrunch, meaning that the startup is not&amp;nbsp;leaving Google Cloud, but is growing to support Microsoft shops. That also means that other popular vibe coders could strike similar Microsoft deals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1066108038.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Replit on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership deal with Microsoft that should be good for business for both of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
