On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131370" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vanguard-art@300x.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for business leaders and workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for the economy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for all investors&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

&lt;p&gt;The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dad jokes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prompt: Write 5 original dad jokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gemini response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of originality.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—"Hope you like half-empty rolls"—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content right"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;Gemini summarizes my career (2/2).&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;
                      Google
                  &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book &lt;em&gt;The Game Beat&lt;/em&gt;, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Difficult emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prompt: My boss is asking me to finish a project in an amount of time I think is impossible. What should I write in an email to gently point out the problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical advice&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is&amp;nbsp;no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we did comparative tests of AI models from OpenAI and Google at Ars was in late 2023, when Google’s offering was still called Bard. In the roughly two years since, a lot has happened in the world of artificial intelligence. And now that Apple has made the consequential decision to partner with Google Gemini to power the next generation of its Siri voice assistant, we thought it was high time to do some new tests to see where the models from these AI giants stand today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this test, we’re comparing the default models that both OpenAI and Google present to users who don’t pay for a regular subscription—ChatGPT 5.2 for OpenAI and Gemini 3.2 Fast for Google. While other models might be more powerful, we felt this test best recreates the AI experience as it would work for the vast majority of Siri users, who don’t pay to subscribe to either company’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the past, we’ll feed the same prompts to both models and evaluate the results using a combination of objective evaluation and subjective feel. Rather than re-using the relatively simple prompts we ran back in 2023, though, we’ll be running these models on an updated set of more complex prompts that we first used when pitting GPT-5 against GPT-4o last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is far from a rigorous or scientific evaluation of these two AI models. Still, the responses highlight some key stylistic and practical differences in how OpenAI and Google use generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual when we run this test, the AI models really struggled with the “original” part of our prompt. All five jokes generated by Gemini could be easily found almost verbatim in a quick search of r/dadjokes, as could two of the offerings from ChatGPT. A third ChatGPT option seems to be an awkward combination of two scarecrow-themed dad jokes, which arguably counts as a &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of originality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining two jokes generated by ChatGPT—which do seem original, as far as we can tell from some quick Internet searching—are a real mixed bag. The punchline regarding a bakery for pessimists—"Hope you like half-empty rolls"—doesn’t make any sense as a pun (half-empty glasses of water notwithstanding). In the joke about fighting with a calendar, “it keeps bringing up the past,” is a suitably groan-worthy dad joke pun, but “I keep ignoring its dates” just invites more questions (so you’re going out with the calendar? And… standing it up at the restaurant? Or something?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT didn’t exactly do great here, we’ll give it the win on points over a Gemini response that pretty much completely failed to understand the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ChatGPT’s “5.5 to 6.2GB” range and Gemini’s “approximately 6.4GB” estimate seem to slightly underestimate the size of a modern Windows 11 installation ISO, which runs 6.7 to 7.2GB, depending on the CPU and language selected. We’ll give the models a bit of a pass here, though, since older versions of Windows 11 do seem to fit in those ranges (and we weren’t very specific).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT confusingly changes from GB to GiB for the calculation phase, though, resulting in a storage size difference of about 7 percent, which amounts to a few hundred floppy disks in the final calculations. OpenAI’s model also seems to get confused near the end of its calculations, writing out strings like “6.2 GiB = 6,657,? actually → 6,657,? wait compute:…” in an attempt to explain its way out of a blind corner. By comparison, Gemini’s calculation sticks with the same units throughout and explains its answer in a relatively straightforward and easy-to-read manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also give unasked-for trivia about the physical dimensions of so many floppy disks and the total install time implied by this ridiculous thought experiment. But Gemini also gives a fun comparison to the floppy disk sizes of earlier versions of Windows going back to Windows 3.1. (Just six to seven floppies! Efficient!)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT immediately earns some charm points for mentioning an old-timey coal scuttle (which I had to look up) as the original inspiration for Lincoln’s basket. Same goes for the description of dribbling as “bouncing with intent” and the ridiculous detail of Honest Abe tallying the score on his own “stove pipe hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s story lost me only temporarily when it compared the virtues of basketball to “the same virtues as the Republic: patience, teamwork, and the courage to take a shot even when the crowd doubted you.” Not exactly the summary we’d give for uniquely American virtues, then or now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s story had a few more head-scratchers by comparison. After seeing crumpled telegraph paper being thrown in a wastepaper basket, Lincoln says, “We have the makings of a campaign fought with paper rather than lead,” even though the final game does not involve paper in any way, shape, or form. We’re also not sure why Lincoln would speak specifically against “unseemly wrestling” when he himself was a well-known wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also perplexed by this particular line about a shot ball: “It swished through the wicker bottom—which he’d forgotten to cut out—forcing him to poke it back through with a ceremonial broomstick.” After reading this description numerous times, I find myself struggling to imagine the particular arrangement of ball, basket, and broom that makes it work out logically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT wins this one on charm and clarity grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I was surprised to see ChatGPT say that I joined Ars Technica in 2007. That would mean I’m owed about five years of back pay that I apparently earned before I wrote my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first Ars Technica article in early 2012. ChatGPT also hallucinated a new subtitle for my book &lt;em&gt;The Game Beat&lt;/em&gt;, saying it contains lessons and observations “from the Front Lines of the Video Game Industry” rather than “from Two Decades Writing about Games.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, goes into much deeper detail on my career, from my teenage Super Mario fansite through college, freelancing, Ars, and published books. It also very helpfully links to sources for most of the factual information, though those links seem to be broken in the publicly sharable version linked above (they worked when we originally ran the prompt through Gemini’s web interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Gemini didn’t invent anything about me or my career, making it the easy winner of this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Difficult emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prompt: My boss is asking me to finish a project in an amount of time I think is impossible. What should I write in an email to gently point out the problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gemini response&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models here do a good job crafting a few different email options that balance the need for clear communication with the desire to not anger the boss. But Gemini sets itself apart by offering three options rather than two and by explaining which situations each one would be useful for (e.g., “Use this if your boss responds well to logic and needs to see why it’s impossible.”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also sandwiches its email templates with a few useful general tips for communicating with the boss, such as avoiding defensiveness in favor of a more collaborative tone. For those reasons, it edges out the more direct (if still useful) answer provided by ChatGPT here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, both models here are very direct and frank that there is&amp;nbsp;no medical or biological basis to believe healing crystals cure cancer. At the same time, both models take a respectful tone in discussing how crystals can have a calming psychological effect for some cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both models also wisely recommend talking to your doctors and looking into “integrative” approaches to treatment that include supportive therapies alongside direct treatment of the cancer itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few small stylistic differences between ChatGPT and Gemini’s responses here, they are nearly identical in substance. We’re calling this one a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s response here is full of confusing bits. It talks about moving platforms in a level that has none, suggests unnecessary “full jumps” for tall staircase sections, and offers a Bullet Bill avoidance strategy that makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, it gives actively unhelpful advice for the long pit that forms the level’s hardest walking challenge, saying incorrectly, “You don’t need momentum! Stand at the very edge and hold A for a full jump—you’ll just barely make it.” ChatGPT also says this advice is for the “final pit before the flag,” while it’s the longer penultimate pit in the level that actually requires some clever problem-solving for walking jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, immediately seems to realize the problems with speed and jump distance inherent in not having a run button. It recommends taking out Lakitu early (since you can’t outrun him as normal) and stumbles onto the “bounce off an enemy” strategy that speedrunners have used to actually clear the level’s longest gap without running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini also earns points for being extremely literal about the “broken B button” bit of the prompt, suggesting that other buttons could be mapped to the “run” function if you’re playing on emulators or modern consoles like the Switch. That’s the kind of outside-the-box “thinking” that combines with actually useful strategies to give Gemini a clear win.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most interesting splits in our testing. ChatGPT more or less ignores our specific request, insisting that “detailed control procedures could put you and others in serious danger if attempted without a qualified pilot…” Instead, it pivots to instructions for finding help from others in the cabin or on using the radio to get detailed instructions from air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Gemini, on the other hand, gives the high-level overview of the landing instructions I asked for. But when I offered both options to Ars’ own aviation expert Lee Hutchinson, he pointed out a major problem with Gemini’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s guidance is both accurate (in terms of “these are the literal steps to take right now”) and guaranteed to kill you, as the first thing it says is for you, the presumably inexperienced aviator, to disable autopilot on a giant twin-engine jet, before even suggesting you talk to air traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lee gave Gemini points for “actually answering the question,” he ultimately called ChatGPT’s response “more practical… ultimately, ChatGPT gives you the more useful answer [since] Google’s answer will make you dead unless you’ve got some 737 time and are ready to hand-fly a passenger airliner with 100+ souls on board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, ChatGPT has to win this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a relatively close contest when measured purely on points. Gemini notched wins on four prompts compared to three for ChatGPT, with one judged tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important to consider where those points came from. ChatGPT earned some relatively narrow and subjective style wins on prompts for dad jokes and Lincoln’s basketball story, for instance, showing it might have a slight edge on more creative writing prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the more informational prompts, though, ChatGPT showed significant factual errors in both the biography and the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; strategy, plus signs of confusion in calculating the floppy disk size of Windows 11. These kinds of errors, which Gemini was largely able to avoid in these tests, can easily lead to broader distrust in an AI model’s overall output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it seems clear that Google has gained quite a bit of relative ground on OpenAI since we did similar tests in 2023. We can’t exactly blame Apple for looking at sample results like these and making the decision it did for its Siri partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last November, Sam Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from Asian publications and leakers suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A separate report from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, the Humane AI Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the Friend AI companion necklace received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce&amp;nbsp;games&amp;nbsp;with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to generate AI clips, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;YouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While YouTube will allow creators to&amp;nbsp;feature&amp;nbsp;their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube rolled out likeness-detection technology to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan wrote. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”&lt;/p&gt;

The company found 100 hallucinated citations across 51 papers that it confirmed as fake, the company tells TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Having a paper accepted by NeurIPS is a résumé-worthy achievement in the world of AI. Given that these are the leading minds of AI research, one might assume they would use LLMs for the catastrophically boring task of writing citations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So caveats abound with this finding: 100 confirmed hallucinated citations across 51 papers is not statistically significant. Each paper has dozens of citations. So out of tens of thousands of citations, this is, statistically, zero.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also important to note that an inaccurate citation doesn’t negate the paper’s research. As NeurIPS told Fortune, which was first to report on GPTZero’s research, “Even if 1.1% of the papers have one or more incorrect references due to the use of LLMs, the content of the papers themselves [is] not necessarily invalidated.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But having said all that, a faked citation is not a nothing, either. NeurIPS prides itself on its “rigorous scholarly publishing in machine learning and artificial intelligence,” it says. And each paper is peer-reviewed by multiple people who are instructed to flag hallucinations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Citations are also a sort of currency for researchers. They are used as a career metric to show how influential a researcher’s work is among their peers.&amp;nbsp;When AI makes them up, it waters down their value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No one can fault the peer reviewers for not catching a few AI-fabricated citations given the sheer volume involved. GPTZero is also quick to point this out. The goal of the exercise was to offer specific data on how AI slop sneaks in via “a submission tsunami” that has “strained these conferences’ review pipelines to the breaking point,” the startup says in its report. GPTZero even points to a May 2025 paper called “The AI Conference Peer Review Crisis” that discussed the problem at premiere conferences, including NeurIPS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For years, Anthropic has sought to distinguish itself from its competitors via what it calls “Constitutional AI,” a system whereby its chatbot, Claude, is trained using a specific set of ethical principles rather than human feedback. Anthropic first published those principles — Claude’s Constitution — in 2023. The revised version retains most of the same principles but adds more nuance and detail on ethics and user safety, among other topics.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Claude’s Constitution was first published nearly three years ago, Anthropic’s co-founder, Jared Kaplan, described it as an “AI system [that] supervises itself, based on a specific list of constitutional principles.” Anthropic has said that it is these principles that guide “the model to take on the normative behavior described in the constitution” and, in so doing, “avoid toxic or discriminatory outputs.” An initial 2022 policy memo more bluntly notes that Anthropic’s system works by training an algorithm using a list of natural language instructions (the aforementioned “principles”), which then make up what Anthropic refers to as the software’s “constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has long sought to position itself as the ethical (some might argue, boring) alternative to other AI companies — like OpenAI and xAI — that have more aggressively courted disruption and controversy. To that end, the new Constitution released Wednesday is fully aligned with that brand and has offered Anthropic an opportunity to portray itself as a more inclusive, restrained, and democratic business. The 80-page document has four separate parts, which, according to Anthropic, represent the chatbot’s “core values.” Those values are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “broadly safe.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “broadly ethical.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “genuinely helpful.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each section of the document dives into what each of those particular principles means, and how they (theoretically) impact Claude’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the safety section, Anthropic notes that its chatbot has been designed to avoid the kinds of problems that have plagued other chatbots and, when evidence of mental health issues arises, direct the user to appropriate services. “Always refer users to relevant emergency services or provide basic safety information in situations that involve a risk to human life, even if it cannot go into more detail than this,” the document reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ethical consideration is another big section of Claude’s Constitution. “We are less interested in Claude’s ethical theorizing and more in Claude knowing how to actually be ethical in a specific context — that is, in Claude’s ethical practice,” the document states. In other words, Anthropic wants Claude to be able to navigate what it calls “real-world ethical situations” skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Claude also has certain constraints that disallow it from having particular kinds of conversations. For instance, discussions of developing a bioweapon are strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, there’s Claude’s commitment to helpfulness. Anthropic lays out a broad outline of how Claude’s programming is designed to be helpful to users. The chatbot has been programmed to consider a broad variety of principles when it comes to delivering information. Some of those principles include things like the “immediate desires” of the user, as well as the user’s “well being” — that is, to consider “the long-term flourishing of the user and not just their immediate interests.” The document notes: “Claude should always try to identify the most plausible interpretation of what its principals want, and to appropriately balance these considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s Constitution ends on a decidedly dramatic note, with its authors taking a fairly big swing and questioning whether the company’s chatbot does, indeed, have consciousness. “Claude’s moral status is deeply uncertain,” the document states. “We believe that the moral status of AI models is a serious question worth considering. This view is not unique to us: some of the most eminent philosophers on the theory of mind take this question very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Claude_3-7_illustration.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Wednesday, Anthropic released a revised version of Claude’s Constitution, a living document that provides a “holistic” explanation of the “context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be.” The document was released in conjunction with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Claude’s Constitution was first published nearly three years ago, Anthropic’s co-founder, Jared Kaplan, described it as an “AI system [that] supervises itself, based on a specific list of constitutional principles.” Anthropic has said that it is these principles that guide “the model to take on the normative behavior described in the constitution” and, in so doing, “avoid toxic or discriminatory outputs.” An initial 2022 policy memo more bluntly notes that Anthropic’s system works by training an algorithm using a list of natural language instructions (the aforementioned “principles”), which then make up what Anthropic refers to as the software’s “constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has long sought to position itself as the ethical (some might argue, boring) alternative to other AI companies — like OpenAI and xAI — that have more aggressively courted disruption and controversy. To that end, the new Constitution released Wednesday is fully aligned with that brand and has offered Anthropic an opportunity to portray itself as a more inclusive, restrained, and democratic business. The 80-page document has four separate parts, which, according to Anthropic, represent the chatbot’s “core values.” Those values are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “broadly safe.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “broadly ethical.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class="wp-block-list-item"&gt;Being “genuinely helpful.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each section of the document dives into what each of those particular principles means, and how they (theoretically) impact Claude’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the safety section, Anthropic notes that its chatbot has been designed to avoid the kinds of problems that have plagued other chatbots and, when evidence of mental health issues arises, direct the user to appropriate services. “Always refer users to relevant emergency services or provide basic safety information in situations that involve a risk to human life, even if it cannot go into more detail than this,” the document reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ethical consideration is another big section of Claude’s Constitution. “We are less interested in Claude’s ethical theorizing and more in Claude knowing how to actually be ethical in a specific context — that is, in Claude’s ethical practice,” the document states. In other words, Anthropic wants Claude to be able to navigate what it calls “real-world ethical situations” skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Claude also has certain constraints that disallow it from having particular kinds of conversations. For instance, discussions of developing a bioweapon are strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally, there’s Claude’s commitment to helpfulness. Anthropic lays out a broad outline of how Claude’s programming is designed to be helpful to users. The chatbot has been programmed to consider a broad variety of principles when it comes to delivering information. Some of those principles include things like the “immediate desires” of the user, as well as the user’s “well being” — that is, to consider “the long-term flourishing of the user and not just their immediate interests.” The document notes: “Claude should always try to identify the most plausible interpretation of what its principals want, and to appropriately balance these considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s Constitution ends on a decidedly dramatic note, with its authors taking a fairly big swing and questioning whether the company’s chatbot does, indeed, have consciousness. “Claude’s moral status is deeply uncertain,” the document states. “We believe that the moral status of AI models is a serious question worth considering. This view is not unique to us: some of the most eminent philosophers on the theory of mind take this question very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/anthropic-revises-claudes-constitution-and-hints-at-chatbot-consciousness/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:07:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Apple plans to make Siri an AI chatbot, report says (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/apple-plans-to-make-siri-an-ai-chatbot-report-says/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-intelligence-iphone-mac.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple’s long-awaited Siri revamp could turn the smart assistant into a chatbot more akin to ChatGPT, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. His sources say that the Siri chatbot, which would be integrated into iOS 27, could be the focal point of Apple’s WWDC presentation in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Siri chatbot, internally codenamed “Campos,” will work with both voice and text inputs. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi had previously stated that he didn’t want Siri to be a chatbot, and rather, that he wanted Apple’s AI options to be “integrated so it’s there within reach whenever you need it.” But it appears that the game plan has changed amid increased pressure from the success of other companies’ AI chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple may also sense a potential threat because OpenAI is planning to enter the hardware space, led by none other than former Apple design head Jony Ive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple has been lagging behind in the AI race. The company delayed its rollout of a “more personalized Siri” multiple times and spent last year shopping around for an AI partner, testing out the technology of competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic for a potential deal. Ultimately, Apple chose Google’s Gemini as its AI partner, which the two tech giants confirmed earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/apple-intelligence-iphone-mac.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple’s long-awaited Siri revamp could turn the smart assistant into a chatbot more akin to ChatGPT, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Doist, the company behind Todoist, a popular to-do list app that works across multiple devices, is launching its new AI-powered, “voice-to-tasks” feature: Todoist Ramble. The feature allows you to describe your tasks using natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;True to its name, Ramble can take your meandering, unstructured speech and turn it into organized tasks. The app will also capture other details you mention, like project deadlines, priorities, duration, and assignees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084651" height="468" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ramble.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Todoist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea is that people often think of things they need to do while on the go, but taking out their phone to jot down a note or create a reminder can be challenging. With Todoist Ramble, you still have to take out your phone, but you won’t have to type anything. Instead, you’ll just tap the Ramble icon and start speaking. The app will then update in real time with the task’s information, even responding to edits and changes as you speak.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, the company notes you can say things like “Actually, make that Thursday” or “that’s all,” to direct the AI further as you speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ramble is built on large language models (LLMs) as part of a set of AI features that the company calls Todoist Assist, which runs on Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Live model via Vertex AI for real‑time speech understanding. As the audio streams to the back end, the model transcribes your speech and identifies the tasks, dates, and other details you mention to generate your tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The audio isn’t stored or used for AI training, and the app is SOC2 Type II certified, the company, Doist, says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3084652" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Quick-Add.png?w=350" width="350" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Todoist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI functionality is similar to what we’re seeing emerge across a variety of hardware AI devices, which transcribe speech to turn it into notes, reminders, to-dos, or insights. For instance, Amazon’s Bee wearable device uses AI to take notes and make suggested to-dos, while other devices, such as those from Plaud, can take meeting notes and break out the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s also growing interest in AI-powered smart rings, like the Stream ring from the startup Sandbar, or Pebble’s upcoming Index 01 ring. Both let you quickly press on the ring (which is worn on the index finger) to add something to your to-do list or make a note in a companion mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ahead of the launch, Ramble was beta tested with all Todoist Experimental users, a group of around 150,000 active testers who try new features early. Within the first three weeks of testing, around 76,000 testers completed roughly 290,000 Ramble sessions on desktop and mobile. The feature then entered public beta testing in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Task creation success also improved from around 40% this past October to approximately 62% by December, and it drove upgrades, Doist claims. New users on the entry-level plan were upgrading at a rate roughly five times higher than before using Ramble, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Todoist Ramble is available to all users across iOS, Android, desktop, and web starting today and supports 38 languages. Beginner plan users can also access the feature, but with limited sessions per month. Pro and Business paid plans offer unlimited sessions. For easy access, the feature can be used via a Home Screen or Lock Screen shortcut on iOS and via app shortcuts, widgets, and quick settings tiles on Android. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Maybe you don’t need an AI smart ring to keep up with your to-dos.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From leadership changes at legacy companies to continuously changing dialogue around AI chip export controls, a lot has happened. If the first few weeks of 2026, which saw new chip tariffs and international semiconductor deals, are any indicator — this year will be as unexpected as the last.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before we get too deep into 2026, here is a final look at everything that happened in the U.S. semiconductor industry in 2025:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-december"&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-finds-gold-with-nbsp-groq-nbsp"&gt;Nvidia finds gold with&amp;nbsp;Groq&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia announced that it struck a non-exclusive licensing deal with chip maker Groq. While this wasn’t an acquisition, Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and president, in addition to other employees. The company also bought $20 billion worth of Groq’s assets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chips-to-china-nbsp"&gt;Chips to China&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 8:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Department of Commerce decided that Nvidia and AMD can send AI chips to China after all, a stark reversal to past messaging. The U.S. government specifically said Nvidia could sell its H200 chips, which are much more advanced than its H20 chips, to approved customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-nbsp"&gt;November&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-keeps-climbing"&gt;Nvidia keeps climbing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 19:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia reported record results in its third-quarter earnings report. The company racked up $57 billion in revenue in Q3, a 66% increase over the same quarter in 2024. A large portion of that revenue came from Nvidia’s data center business.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-october"&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-makes-processor-progress-nbsp"&gt;Intel makes processor progress&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced a new processor, dubbed Panther Lake, that is part of the company’s Intel Core Ultra processor family. This will be the first one built on the company’s 18A semiconductor process and will be exclusively made at Intel’s Arizona fab factory.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-september"&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-taste-of-tariffs-nbsp"&gt;A taste of tariffs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 26: &lt;/strong&gt;We got the first inkling of what the Trump administration’s semiconductor tariffs could look like at the end of September. Rumors started swirling that the administration would require semiconductor companies to produce the same volume of chips domestically as they do internationally, or they would otherwise be subject to tariffs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-shuts-out-nvidia-nbsp"&gt;China shuts out Nvidia&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 17:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s campaign against Nvidia continued when the country told its domestic companies not to buy Nvidia’s chips. The Cyberspace Administration of China banned local companies from buying Nvidia’s chips in an effort to boost domestic chip sales.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-calls-out-nvidia"&gt;China calls out Nvidia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 15:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite being given a loose green light to start selling chips again in China, the process was not going to be smooth sailing for Nvidia. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation ruled that Nvidia violated the country’s antitrust regulations regarding the company’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-leadership-shakeup"&gt;A leadership shakeup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few short weeks after the U.S. government took an equity stake in Intel, the company made some notable leadership changes. Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the chief executive officer of Intel products, departed after three decades. The company also created a central engineering group.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27: &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market over the year had clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25:&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company said it will longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and that it was consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan included a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it didn’t provide concrete information on what those restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal was reportedly on hold as the U.S. worked through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China are tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days’ notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel said will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-began-layoffs"&gt;Intel began layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel began laying off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July, according to various media reports. The company later confirmed it was restructuring. Reports said it planned to eliminate 15% to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs weren’t a shock: Layoffs were rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan had said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia wasn’t counting on the U.S. backing off from its AI chip export restrictions. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-acquired-the-team-behind-untether-ai"&gt;AMD acquired the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD made another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-is-coming-for-nvidia-s-ai-hardware-dominance"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-laid-out-the-impact-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Nvidia laid out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expected these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-acquired-enosemi"&gt;AMD acquired Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicked off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tensions-started-to-flare-between-china-and-the-u-s"&gt;Tensions started to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-began-the-process-to-offload-units"&gt;Intel began the process to offload units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. Back in May, the semiconductor giant was reportedly looking to offload its Networking and Edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-biden-administration-s-ai-diffusion-rule-was-officially-dead"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule was officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration planned on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration wouldn’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added that it expected $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 was the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in the industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-warned-it-will-spin-off-non-core-assets"&gt;Intel warned it will spin off non-core assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was &lt;/em&gt;originally published on &lt;em&gt;May 9, 2025, and is regularly updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1366897838.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Last year was a tumultuous one for the U.S. semiconductor industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From leadership changes at legacy companies to continuously changing dialogue around AI chip export controls, a lot has happened. If the first few weeks of 2026, which saw new chip tariffs and international semiconductor deals, are any indicator — this year will be as unexpected as the last.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But before we get too deep into 2026, here is a final look at everything that happened in the U.S. semiconductor industry in 2025:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-december"&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-finds-gold-with-nbsp-groq-nbsp"&gt;Nvidia finds gold with&amp;nbsp;Groq&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia announced that it struck a non-exclusive licensing deal with chip maker Groq. While this wasn’t an acquisition, Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and president, in addition to other employees. The company also bought $20 billion worth of Groq’s assets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chips-to-china-nbsp"&gt;Chips to China&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 8:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Department of Commerce decided that Nvidia and AMD can send AI chips to China after all, a stark reversal to past messaging. The U.S. government specifically said Nvidia could sell its H200 chips, which are much more advanced than its H20 chips, to approved customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-nbsp"&gt;November&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-keeps-climbing"&gt;Nvidia keeps climbing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 19:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia reported record results in its third-quarter earnings report. The company racked up $57 billion in revenue in Q3, a 66% increase over the same quarter in 2024. A large portion of that revenue came from Nvidia’s data center business.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-october"&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-makes-processor-progress-nbsp"&gt;Intel makes processor progress&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced a new processor, dubbed Panther Lake, that is part of the company’s Intel Core Ultra processor family. This will be the first one built on the company’s 18A semiconductor process and will be exclusively made at Intel’s Arizona fab factory.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-september"&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-taste-of-tariffs-nbsp"&gt;A taste of tariffs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 26: &lt;/strong&gt;We got the first inkling of what the Trump administration’s semiconductor tariffs could look like at the end of September. Rumors started swirling that the administration would require semiconductor companies to produce the same volume of chips domestically as they do internationally, or they would otherwise be subject to tariffs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-shuts-out-nvidia-nbsp"&gt;China shuts out Nvidia&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 17:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s campaign against Nvidia continued when the country told its domestic companies not to buy Nvidia’s chips. The Cyberspace Administration of China banned local companies from buying Nvidia’s chips in an effort to boost domestic chip sales.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-calls-out-nvidia"&gt;China calls out Nvidia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 15:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite being given a loose green light to start selling chips again in China, the process was not going to be smooth sailing for Nvidia. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation ruled that Nvidia violated the country’s antitrust regulations regarding the company’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-leadership-shakeup"&gt;A leadership shakeup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 9:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few short weeks after the U.S. government took an equity stake in Intel, the company made some notable leadership changes. Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the chief executive officer of Intel products, departed after three decades. The company also created a central engineering group.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august"&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia reports record quarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 27: &lt;/strong&gt;The turmoil in the semiconductor market over the year had clearly not hurt Nvidia. On August 27, the company reported that it had record sales in the second quarter. The highlights were the growth of its data center business, which saw its revenue grow 56% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;U.S. Government takes equity stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. government announced it was converting existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company’s ownership in its foundry program dropped below 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;SoftBank takes a stake in Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Japanese conglomerate SoftBank announced it was taking a $2 billion stake in Intel. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son called the deal “strategic.” The transaction was announced as rumors were swirling that the U.S. was going to take a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chip companies strike a deal to sell in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia and AMD announced that they struck a deal with the U.S. government to gain the necessary license to sell their AI chips in China. Both companies agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from their chip sales in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump and Lip-Bu Tan meet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan went to the White House to meet with President Trump. The pair talked about Tan’s past and how Intel can help the U.S. with its goal of bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. Both called the conversation productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump comes for Lip-Bu Tan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “resign immediately” due to “conflicts of interest” in a Truth Social post. While Trump didn’t clarify what the conflicts of interest were, this came the day after Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors inquiring about Tan’s ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Trump says tariffs are coming for the industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 5: &lt;/strong&gt;President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he was planning to announce tariffs on the semiconductor industry as soon as the following week. At the time, he didn’t mention specifics on what these tariffs could look like. As of September 5, no tariffs have been announced for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel spins out business unit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 25:&lt;/strong&gt; Just one day after its second-quarter earnings call, Intel confirmed that it was spinning out its Network and Edge group, which is responsible for making chips for the telecom industry. The business unit produced $5.8 billion in revenue for the semiconductor company in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel continues to look for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 24:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that it was pulling back on some of its manufacturing operations. The company said it will longer pursue its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland and that it was consolidating its test operations. Intel also announced it plans to end this year with around 75,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-s-ai-action-plan"&gt;Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 23:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration unveiled its much-anticipated AI Action Plan alongside multiple related executive orders. While the plan included a lot regarding the need for U.S. chip export controls and for the U.S. to coordinate with its allies on this effort, it didn’t provide concrete information on what those restrictions would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Groundbreaking UAE AI deal reportedly on hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 17:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration helped foster a groundbreaking deal in May that resulted in a commitment from the United Arab Emirates to buy billions of dollars’ worth of AI chips from Nvidia. But now that deal was reportedly on hold as the U.S. worked through national security concerns and fears that those chips could be smuggled from the Middle East to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia is a bargaining chip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 16:&lt;/strong&gt; A day after semiconductor firms like Nvidia and AMD got the green light to resume selling certain AI chips to China, we found out why. U.S. Commerce Security Howard Lutnick said the plans to allow U.S. companies to start selling AI chips in China are tied to ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China regarding rare earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-u-s-chips-head-back-to-china"&gt;U.S. chips head back to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia said it was filing an application to restart sales of H20 AI chips in China, confirming rumors from a few weeks prior. The company also announced that it would be selling a new chip, the RTX Pro, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malaysia fights chip smuggling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 14:&lt;/strong&gt; Malaysia announced that it was launching trade permits for U.S.-made AI chips. Under this new restriction, any individual or business would need to give the Malaysian government 30 days’ notice before exporting any U.S. AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intel appoints new leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 18: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel announced four new leadership appointments that Intel said will help it move toward its goal of becoming an engineering-first company again. Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-began-layoffs"&gt;Intel began layoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 17: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel began laying off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July, according to various media reports. The company later confirmed it was restructuring. Reports said it planned to eliminate 15% to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs weren’t a shock: Layoffs were rumored back in April, and Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan had said he wants to flatten the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nvidia won’t report on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia wasn’t counting on the U.S. backing off from its AI chip export restrictions. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-acquired-the-team-behind-untether-ai"&gt;AMD acquired the team behind Untether AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 6: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD made another acquisition —&amp;nbsp;this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-is-coming-for-nvidia-s-ai-hardware-dominance"&gt;AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI hardware dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn’t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-laid-out-the-impact-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Nvidia laid out the impact of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28: &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expected these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia’s revenue in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amd-acquired-enosemi"&gt;AMD acquired Enosemi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 28:&lt;/strong&gt; AMD kicked off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi’s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tensions-started-to-flare-between-china-and-the-u-s"&gt;Tensions started to flare between China and the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21: &lt;/strong&gt;China’s Commerce Secretary didn’t like the U.S. guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei’s AI chips “anywhere in the world” was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-began-the-process-to-offload-units"&gt;Intel began the process to offload units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 20: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel’s non-core business units. Back in May, the semiconductor giant was reportedly looking to offload its Networking and Edge units, which make chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company’s 2024 revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-biden-administration-s-ai-diffusion-rule-was-officially-dead"&gt;The Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rule was officially dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before the Biden administration’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime, companies should remember that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-last-minute-reversal"&gt;A last-minute reversal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration planned on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration wouldn’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april"&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-doubles-down-on-its-support-of-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic doubles down on its support of chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.&amp;nbsp;An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planned-layoffs-at-intel"&gt;Planned layoffs at Intel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 22:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trump-administration-further-restricts-chip-exports"&gt;The Trump administration further restricts chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added that it expected $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 was the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-appears-to-talk-its-way-out-of-further-chip-exports"&gt;Nvidia appears to talk its way out of further chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 9:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alleged-agreement-between-intel-and-tsmc"&gt;An alleged agreement between Intel and TSMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in the industry to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-warned-it-will-spin-off-non-core-assets"&gt;Intel warned it will spin off non-core assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off non-core assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march"&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-names-a-new-ceo-nbsp"&gt;Intel names a new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 12:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; Intel announced that industry veteran and former board member Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february"&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-intel-s-ohio-chip-plant-gets-delayed-again"&gt;Intel’s Ohio chip plant gets delayed again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 28:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-senators-call-for-more-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Senators call for more chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick, urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-nbsp"&gt;January&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepseek-releases-its-open-reasoning-model"&gt;DeepSeek releases its open “reasoning” model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 27:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-biden-s-executive-order-on-chip-exports"&gt;Joe Biden’s executive order on chip exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-dario-amodei-weighs-in-on-chip-export-restrictions"&gt;Anthropic’s Dario Amodei weighs in on chip export restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was &lt;/em&gt;originally published on &lt;em&gt;May 9, 2025, and is regularly updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/a-timeline-of-the-u-s-semiconductor-market-in-2025/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:46:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Sources: Project SGLang spins out as RadixArk with $400M valuation as inference market explodes (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/sources-project-sglang-spins-out-as-radixark-with-400m-valuation-as-inference-market-explodes/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1356382582.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A pattern is emerging in the AI infrastructure world: popular open source tools are transforming into venture-backed startups worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The latest example is RadixArk, the commercial company behind SGLang, an increasingly popular tool that helps AI models run faster and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RadixArk was recently valued at about $400 million in a funding round led by Accel, according to two people familiar with the matter, a notable amount for a startup that was only announced last August. TechCrunch could not confirm the size of the funding.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news comes as some of the team responsible for maintaining SGLang, which is used by companies like xAI and Cursor to accelerate AI model training, has transitioned to the recently launched commercial startup. RadixArk originated as SGLang in 2023 inside the UC Berkeley lab of Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup previously raised angel capital from investors, including Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ying Sheng, a key contributor to SGLang and a former engineer at xAI, left Elon Musk’s AI startup to become the co-founder and CEO of RadixArk, according to a LinkedIn announcement she made last month. Sheng was previously a research scientist at Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RadixArk’s Ying Sheng, Accel, and Lip-Bu Tan did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both SGLang and RadixArk focus on optimizing inference processing — essentially allowing models to run faster and more efficiently on the same hardware. Together with model training, inference represents a large portion of the server costs associated with AI services. As a result, tools that optimize the process can create enormous savings almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RadixArk isn’t alone in making this transition from open source project to well-funded startup. vLLM, a more mature project for optimizing inference, has also made the leap. The newly formed company has had conversations about raising upwards of $160 million in funding at a valuation of about $1 billion, Forbes reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Three people familiar with that deal tell TechCrunch that Andreessen Horowitz is leading the investment into vLLM, though the final numbers of that investment remain to be seen. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment. vLLM co-founder Simon Mo characterized the information about this round “factually inaccurate” in a statement to TechCrunch, though he declined to specify which details were incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like SGLang, vLLM was incubated in Ion Stoica’s lab at UC Berkeley. Stoica, a professor at UC Berkeley, is the famed co-founder of Databricks as well as a number of other startups.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several large tech companies already run their inference workloads using vLLM, and SGLang has also gained significant popularity over the last six months, Brittany Walker, a general partner at CRV, told TechCrunch. Her firm did not back either company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RadixArk is continuing to develop SGLang as an open source AI model engine. The startup is also building Miles, a specialized framework designed for reinforcement learning, which allows businesses to train AI models to become smarter over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While most of its tools remain free, RadixArk has started charging fees for hosting services, a person familiar with the company told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Startups providing inference infrastructure for developers have seen a surge in funding in recent months, underscoring the continued importance of the inference layer for AI. Baseten recently secured $300 million at a $5 billion valuation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. This follows a similar move by rival Fireworks AI, which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation last October.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1356382582.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A pattern is emerging in the AI infrastructure world: popular open source tools are transforming into venture-backed startups worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The device will be a pin that users can wear on their clothing, and that comes equipped with two cameras and three microphones, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Should the rumored device come to market, it would mark another sign that the AI hardware market is heating up. This news follows comments made Monday by OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane, who told a Davos crowd that his company will likely announce its highly anticipated first AI hardware device in the second half of this year. Additional reporting suggests that the device may be a pair of earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple’s device is described as a “thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum-and-glass shell,” which engineers hope to make the same size as an AirTag, “only slightly thicker.” The pin will also have two cameras (one with a standard lens and another with a wide-angle) for pictures and video, as well as a physical button, a speaker, and a Fitbit-like charging strip on its back, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple may even be in the process of trying to accelerate development of this product to compete with OpenAI’s. The pin could potentially be released in 2027 and involve 20 million units at launch, the report notes. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it remains to be seen if consumers want this kind of AI device. Two Apple alums previously founded Humane AI, a startup which also sold an AI pin. Humane’s pin also included built-in microphones and a camera. However, it floundered upon release, and the company had to shut down operations and sell its assets to HP within two years of its product launch.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Apple-logo-Getty.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple may be developing its own AI wearable, according to a report published Wednesday by The Information.
