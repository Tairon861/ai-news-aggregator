The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said Marc Bhargava, who leads GC’s related efforts, in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you can automate services business, too, he said – tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers – the math begins to look irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The game plan seems to be working right now. Take Titan MSP, one of GC’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, the firm incubated Eudia, which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Chevron, Southwest Airlines, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hanna, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GC looks to double – at least – the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The powerhouse firm isn’t alone in its thinking. The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments, including Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company, then grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, told TechCrunch this summer. “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an interview with TechCrunch this spring. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be more complicated than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” – AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first decipher it, then decide whether or not to send it back, and oftentimes just to fix it themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based on those participants’ estimates of time spent, along with their self-reported salaries, the authors of the survey estimate that workslop carries an invisible tax of $186 per month per person. “For an organization of 10,000 workers, given the estimated prevalence of workslop . . .this yields over $9 million per year in lost productivity,” they write in a new Harvard Business Review article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bhargava disputed the notion that AI is overhyped, arguing instead that all these implementation failures actually validate GC’s approach. “I think it kind of shows the opportunity, which is, it’s not easy to apply AI technology to these businesses,” he said. “If all the Fortune 100 and all these folks could just bring in a consulting firm, slap on some AI, get a contract with OpenAI, and transform their business, then obviously our thesis [would be] a little bit less robust. But the reality is, it’s really hard to transform a company with AI.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He pointed to the technical sophistication required in AI as the most critical missing puzzle piece. “There’s a lot of different technology. It’s good at different things,” he said. “You really need these applied AI engineers from places like Rippling and Ramp and Figma and Scale, who have worked with the different models, understand their nuances, understand which ones are good for what, understand how to wrap it in software.” That complexity is exactly why GC’s strategy of pairing AI specialists with industry experts to build companies from the ground up makes sense, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, there’s no denying that workslop threatens to undermine — to some extent — the strategy’s core economics. Even if a holding company is created as starting point, if the acquired companies reduce staff as the AI efficiency thesis suggests they should, they’ll have fewer people available to catch and correct AI-generated errors. If the companies maintain current staffing levels to handle the additional work created by problematic AI output, the huge margin gains that VCs are counting on might never be realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arguably, these scenarios should perhaps slow the scaling plans that are central to the VCs’ roll-up strategies and that potentially undermine the numbers that make these deals attractive to them. But let’s face it; it will take more than a study or two to slow down most Silicon Valley investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, because they typically acquire businesses with existing cash flow, GC says its “creation strategy” companies are already profitable — a marked departure from the traditional VC playbook of backing high-growth, cash-burning startups. It’s also likely a welcome change for the limited partners behind venture firms, who have bankrolled years of losses at companies that never reached profitability.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As long as AI technology continues to improve, and we see this massive investment and improvement in the models,” Bhargava said, “I think there’ll just be more and more industries for us to help incubate companies.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/startup-wind-down.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Venture capitalists have convinced themselves they’ve found the next big investing edge: using AI to wring software-like margins out of traditionally labor-intensive services businesses.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paid just closed an oversubscribed $21.6 million seed round led by Lightspeed. With the €10 million pre-seed round it raised in March, London-based Paid has already raised $33.3 million and hasn’t even hit its Series A yet. A source familiar with the deal says the startup’s valuation is over $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paid came out of stealth in March offering an interesting contribution to the AI agentic world: The company doesn’t offer agents. It offers a way for agent makers to charge their customers for these worker algorithms, based on the value their agents provide. This is a growing theme in AI, sometimes called “results-based billing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paid promises to help agent makers “start charging for points of margin saved by their customers,” Medina describes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a new way of charging for software for the AI age. This is instead of the unlimited use, per-user fees of the SaaS era, or the unlimited use, buy-it-once-and-install-it fees of the client/server era.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per-user fees don’t work because agent makers pay usage fees to the model providers as well as to cloud providers. Unlimited use could drive them into the red. (The vibe coding startup world tends to suffer from this issue.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Agent providers instead “need to show the value the agent is delivering to your customers, because agents are running in the background for the most part,” Medina tells TechCrunch. If agents do work as advertised, then they’ll be assigned increasingly more, with their growing workloads going unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re a quiet agent, you don’t get paid,” Madina says. “You need an infrastructure that allows the agent to charge for the additional work that the agent is doing,” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But charging a monthly fee for a limited number of credits — following the model makers and vibe coders — is risky for agent-makers, too. That’s because companies don’t want to pay for AI slop, which is still what most AI produces. After billions spent on AI pilots, some 95% of enterprise projects were found to have no value, with only 5% put into production, according to a recent study from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Companies don’t want to pay agents to produce more emails that no one reads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the startup’s early customers, for instance, is Artisan, the viral sales automation startup. (By the way, you can hear Artisan’s CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack speak on the topic at TechCrunch Disrupt next month.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Paid is also starting to see success with SaaS companies looking at agents for their next big growth. The startup just landed ERP vendor IFS as a new customer, it said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lightspeed’s Alexander Schmitt says the venture firm has invested “more than $2.5 billion into AI infrastructure and application layer companies over the last three years,” and has witnessed firsthand that most AI pilots fail. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The core of that problem is that no one can really attach value to what agents are doing today,” Schmitt said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Schmitt thinks that Paid is, so far, unique in its approach, saying “it’s something that we haven’t seen someone else build.” No doubt more competition for agentic results-based billing will come if it really does help agents enter the workforce en mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New investor FUSE and existing investor EQT Ventures also participated in the round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Paid-Manny-Medina-Co-founder-and-CEO.jpg?resize=1200,1074" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Manny Medina, previously best-known as the founder of sales automation startup Outreach ($4.4 billion valuation), has wowed investors with his young startup, Paid.&lt;/p&gt;

Referencing the impact of DeepSeek-R1’s release earlier this year, Xu noted: “Between January and April 30, our AI R&amp;amp;D teams worked closely to make sure that the inference capabilities of our Ascend 910B and 910C chips can keep up with customer needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following customer feedback sessions, Xu stated: “Our customers have raised many issues and expectations they’ve had with Ascend. And they keep giving us great suggestions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledgement of developer pain points provided context for the comprehensive open-source commitments announced at the August 5, 2025 Ascend Computing Industry Development Summit and reinforced by Xu at Huawei Connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers who have struggled with Ascend tooling, documentation, or ecosystem maturity, the frank assessment signals awareness of gaps between the platform’s technical capabilities and its practical usability. The open-source strategy appears designed directly to address these friction points by enabling community contributions, transparency, and external improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CANN: Compiler and virtual instruction set details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most technically significant commitment involves CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks), Huawei’s foundational toolkit that sits between AI frameworks and Ascend hardware. At the August summit, Xu specified: “For CANN, we will open interfaces for the compiler and virtual instruction set, and fully open-source other software.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiered approach distinguishes between components receiving full open-source treatment versus those where Huawei will provide open interfaces with potentially proprietary implementations. The compiler and virtual instruction set – important translation layers that convert high-level code into hardware-executable instructions – will have open interfaces. This means developers can understand and potentially optimise how their code gets compiled for Ascend processors, even if the compiler implementation itself remains partially closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction matters for performance tuning. Developers need visibility into compilation processes when working on latency-sensitive applications or are trying to extract maximum efficiency from hardware. Open interfaces provide that visibility; full open-source would additionally enable replacing or modifying the compiler itself. Huawei’s approach offers transparency for optimisation yet retains some proprietary elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline remains firm: “We will go open source and open access with CANN (based on existing Ascend 910B/910C design) by December 31, 2025.” The specification of “based on existing Ascend 910B/910C design” clarifies that the open-source release will reflect current-generation hardware rather than future chip architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mind series: Application enablement kits and toolchains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the foundational CANN layer, Huawei committed to open-sourcing what developers interact with daily: “For our Mind series application enablement kits and toolchains, we will go fully open-source by December 31, 2025,” Xu said at Huawei Connect, reinforcing the commitment made at the Ascend Computing Industry Development Summit on August 5, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mind series encompasses the practical development environment – the SDKs, libraries, debugging tools, profilers, and utilities that developers use when building AI applications. Unlike CANN’s tiered approach with open interfaces for some components, the Mind series sees a blanket commitment to full open-source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the entire application layer toolchain becomes inspect-able, modifiable, and community-extensible. Debugging tools could be enhanced with needed functionality, libraries can be optimised for specific use cases, and utilities can be wrapped in more ergonomic interfaces. In short, the development ecosystem will evolve through community contributions rather than standing on vendor updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the announcement didn’t specify which tools specifically comprise the Mind series, which programming languages they support, or how comprehensive the documentation is to be. Developers evaluating whether to invest time in the platform will need to assess toolchain completeness once the December release arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OpenPangu foundation models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei has also committed to “fully open-source our openPangu foundation models.” This positions Huawei in the open-source foundation model space alongside Meta’s Llama series, Mistral AI’s offerings, and various other initiatives that lean into community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement provided no specifics about openPangu capabilities, parameter counts, training data, or licensing terms. Foundation model open-sourcing raises questions beyond licensing, and what restrictions will exist on commercial use. What datasets were used for training, and what biases or limitations does each model exhibit? Can the model be fine-tuned and redistributed? These issues have yet to be resolved, at least publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, open-source foundation models provide starting points for domain-specific applications without requiring the massive computational resources needed for training from scratch. However, model quality, licensing flexibility, and available documentation determine practical utility. The December release will reveal whether openPangu models represent competitive alternatives to established open-source options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operating system integration flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One practical implementation detail that emerged at Huawei Connect 2025 addresses a common barrier to adopting new AI infrastructure: operating system compatibility. Huawei announced that “Huawei has made the entire UB OS Component open-source, so that its code can be integrated into upstream open-source OS communities like openEuler.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration approach offers unusual flexibility. According to the announcements: “Users can integrate part or all of the UB OS Component’s source code into their existing OSes, to support independent iteration and version maintenance. Users can also embed the entire component into their existing OSes as a plug-in to ensure it can evolve in-step with open-source communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modular design means organisations running Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or other distros aren’t forced to migrate to a Huawei-specific operating systems. The UB OS Component – which handles SuperPod interconnect management at the operating system level – can be integrated into existing environments. For developers and system administrators, this lowers deployment friction significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, flexibility comes with responsibility. Organisations choosing to integrate UB OS Component source code into their own systems become responsible for testing, maintenance, and updates. Huawei is providing the component as open-source rather than as a supported product for arbitrary Linux distributions. The approach works well for organisations with strong Linux expertise; it may prove challenging for those expecting turnkey vendor support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Framework compatibility strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important factor for developer adoption is compatibility with existing AI frameworks. Rather than forcing developers to abandon familiar tools, Huawei is building integration layers. According to Huawei, it “has been prioritising support for open-source communities like PyTorch and vLLM to help developers independently innovate.” PyTorch compatibility is particularly significant given that framework’s dominance in AI research and production deployments. If developers can write standard PyTorch code that executes efficiently on Ascend hardware without extensive modifications, the barrier to experimentation drops substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations could evaluate Ascend infrastructure using minimally-tweaked existing codebases rather than requiring rewrites. The vLLM integration targets a specific high-demand use case: optimised large language model inference. As organisations deploy LLM-based applications, inference performance and cost become important factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native vLLM support suggests Huawei is addressing practical deployment concerns rather than just research capabilities. However, the announcements didn’t detail the completeness of any integration. Partial PyTorch compatibility that requires workarounds for certain operations or delivers suboptimal performance may prove more frustrating than existing alternatives. The quality of framework integrations will determine whether they genuinely lower adoption barriers or simply create new categories of compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;December 31 deadline and what follows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 31, 2025 timeline for open-sourcing CANN, Mind series, and openPangu models is approximately three months away. The near-term deadline suggests substantial preparation work is already complete: code has been cleaned of internal dependencies, documentation is being written, licensing terms are being finalised, and repository infrastructure is being established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial release quality will largely determine community response. Open-source projects that arrive with incomplete documentation, limited examples, missing features, or immature tooling often fail to attract contributors regardless of underlying technical merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers evaluating unfamiliar platforms need comprehensive learning resources, working examples, and clear paths from “Hello World” to production deployment. The December release represents a beginning rather than a culmination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful open-source projects require sustained investment beyond initial code publication. Community management, issue triage, pull request review and merge, documentation maintenance, and roadmap coordination all demand ongoing resources. Whether Huawei commits to multi-year community support will determine whether the platform develops an active contributor base or becomes abandoned code with public repositories but minimal development activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What remains unspecified&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the specific commitments and timelines, several important details about open-source AI development on Ascend remain undefined. Licence selection will fundamentally affect how developers and organisations can use the software. Permissive licences like Apache 2.0 or MIT enable commercial use with minimal restrictions and allow proprietary derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyleft licenses like GPL require derivative works to also be open-sourced, which affects traditional models of commercial product development. Huawei hasn’t specified under which licences the December releases will be. Overall governance structures for the open-source projects are equally unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will there be an independent foundation overseeing development? Will Huawei accept external maintainers with commit privileges? How will feature priorities and roadmap decisions be made? Will there be a transparent process for accepting community contributions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance questions often determine whether projects attract genuine external participation or remain vendor-controlled initiatives with public code but limited community influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developer evaluation timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers and organisations considering investment in Huawei’s open-source AI development platform, the next three months provide time for preparation and evaluation. Organisations can assess their requirements, evaluate whether Ascend hardware specifications match their workload characteristics, and prepare teams for potential platform adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 31 release will provide concrete materials for hands-on evaluation: actual code to review, documentation to assess, examples to test, and toolchains to experiment with. The weeks following release will reveal community response – whether external developers file issues, contribute improvements, and begin building the ecosystem resources that make platforms increasingly capable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-2026, patterns should have emerged about whether Huawei’s open-source AI development strategy is succeeding in building an active community around Ascend infrastructure or whether the platform remains primarily a vendor-led initiative with limited external participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, a six-month window from December 2025 through to around mid-2026 will be an evaluation period for determining whether this open-source platform warrants serious investment of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Inside Huawei’s plan to make thousands of AI chips think like one computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We’re excited to share that we’ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list features businesses from around the world that are building technologies to reduce emissions or address the impacts of climate change. They represent advances across a wide range of industries, from agriculture and transportation to energy and critical minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable difference about this year’s list is that we’ve focused on fewer firms—we’ll highlight 10 instead of the 15 we’ve recognized in previous years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This change reflects the times: Climate science and technology are in a dramatically different place from where they were just one year ago. The US, the world’s largest economy and historically its biggest polluter, has made a U-turn on climate policy as the Trump administration cancels hundreds of billions of dollars in grants, tax credits, and loans designed to support the industry and climate research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the stark truth is that time is of the essence. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, the UN treaty that aimed to limit global warming by setting a goal of cutting emissions so that temperatures would rise no more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial temperatures. Today, experts agree that we’ve virtually run out of time to reach that goal and will need to act fast to limit warming to less than 2 °C.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies on this year’s list are inventing and scaling technologies that could help. There’s a wide array of firms represented, from early-stage startups to multibillion-dollar businesses. Their technologies run the gamut from electric vehicles to the materials that scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, we can’t claim to be able to predict the future: Not all the businesses we’ve recognized will succeed.

This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We’re excited to share that we’ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list features businesses from around the world that are building technologies to reduce emissions or address the impacts of climate change. They represent advances across a wide range of industries, from agriculture and transportation to energy and critical minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable difference about this year’s list is that we’ve focused on fewer firms—we’ll highlight 10 instead of the 15 we’ve recognized in previous years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This change reflects the times: Climate science and technology are in a dramatically different place from where they were just one year ago. The US, the world’s largest economy and historically its biggest polluter, has made a U-turn on climate policy as the Trump administration cancels hundreds of billions of dollars in grants, tax credits, and loans designed to support the industry and climate research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the stark truth is that time is of the essence. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, the UN treaty that aimed to limit global warming by setting a goal of cutting emissions so that temperatures would rise no more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial temperatures. Today, experts agree that we’ve virtually run out of time to reach that goal and will need to act fast to limit warming to less than 2 °C.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies on this year’s list are inventing and scaling technologies that could help. There’s a wide array of firms represented, from early-stage startups to multibillion-dollar businesses. Their technologies run the gamut from electric vehicles to the materials that scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, we can’t claim to be able to predict the future: Not all the businesses we’ve recognized will succeed. But we’ve done our best to choose companies with a solid technical footing, as well as feasible plans for bringing their solutions to the right market and scaling them effectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share the list with you in just a few days.

Two former Microsoft executives view it as a problem — and they have started Maximor to replace spreadsheets with AI agents for the grunt work finance teams perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Excel spreadsheets are everywhere in finance. Even with dedicated ERP, CRM, and billing systems, many mid-sized companies and enterprises still export transactions into Excel for manual reconciliation. Teams often treat spreadsheets as makeshift databases, sometimes even relying on functions like VLOOKUP — a function used to pull matching numbers from one table into another — to line up figures across files. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor aims to replace finance teams’ reliance on Excel with its AI system, and has emerged from stealth with a $9 million seed round led by Foundation Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup uses a network of AI agents that connect directly to ERP, CRM, and billing systems to continuously pull transactions. That, co-founder and CEO Ramnandan Krishnamurthy (pictured above, right) said in an exclusive interview, helps unify operational and financial data and provide real-time financial visibility — instead of waiting until month-end to sort it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approach should help reduce the time needed for the month-end close, he believes. For instance, Maximor says that proptech firm Rently, one of its early customers, cut its closing from eight days to four and avoided two additional accounting hires. Rently was able to redirect nearly half its team’s time to strategic work after using Maximor’s agentic platform, Rently’s CFO Dustin Neel said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor’s financial agents plug into ERPs like NetSuite and Intacct, accounting tools such as QuickBooks and Zoho Books, and a range of payroll, CRM, and other SaaS platforms. Once connected, they generate workpapers, reviewer notes, and audit trails — helping streamline audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Maximor aims to reduce reliance on Excel, it still allows teams to export reconciled data into spreadsheets — a format that many auditors and finance staff prefer before sending numbers to audit.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re interoperable with Excel on that part, as our platform does the work and can present it in our own UI or in Excel directly,” Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to its AI agents, Maximor offers human accountants as a human-in-the-loop option for its AI work, or as an accounting service for companies without in-house finance teams. It’s an interesting failsafe, given that Maximor pitches itself as an AI startup that automates this work. Relying on humans may seem at odds with that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch that the software is self-sufficient, with agents handling end-to-end work independently. The agents act as preparers and people act as reviewers, he said, adding that it works much like traditional accounting teams, where junior staff handle routine tasks and managers focus on oversight.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Krishnamurthy co-founded Maximor in the summer of 2024 after years at Microsoft as a founding member of its digital transformation group, where he led finance and data projects for Fortune 500 clients, including Coca-Cola. He teamed up with Ajay Krishna Amudan, now CTO, who previously worked on a revamp Microsoft’s internal revenue systems, among other projects there. The two have worked together for 14 years, starting as students at IIT-Madras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The duo’s finance experience at Microsoft helped attract angel investors including CFOs and finance leaders from Ramp, Gusto, MongoDB, Zuora, and the Big Four accounting firms, Krishnamurthy said. The seed round also drew Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, a former IIT-Madras classmate of Krishnamurthy, and Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo, who was introduced by the VCs backing the round. Institutional investors Gaia Ventures and Boldcap also took part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor, headquartered in New York with an office in Bengaluru, has 18 employees split almost evenly between the U.S. and India, and is actively hiring in both locations. The startup targets companies with at least $50 million in revenue and already counts early customers in the U.S., China, and India. Moreover, Maximor’s software supports both GAAP and IFRS standards, catering to enterprises with a global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/maximor-founders.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Despite millions spent on financial software, many finance teams still rely on Excel to close their books and reconcile numbers while preparing them for audit.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming soon: our 2025 list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The need to cut emissions and adapt to our warming world is growing more urgent. This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, MIT Technology Review has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We’re excited to share that we’ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.
