&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RNGD is optimized for running large language models (LLMs) and just last week, the Korean tech giant  LG unveiled its next-generation hybrid AI model EXAONE 4.0. The collaboration targets key sectors, including electronics, finance, telecommunications, and biotechnology, for a range of diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This news comes roughly three months after FuriosaAI declined Meta’s $800 million acquisition offer, opting to remain independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal fell through due to disagreements over post-acquisition business strategy and organizational structure, rather than price issues, according to local media outlets. Meta’s interest in acquiring AI chipmakers like FuriosaAI reflects its broader strategy to reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers, such as Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When asked why the deal with Meta fell through, CEO of FuriosaAI June Paik told TechCrunch: “We want to continue our mission, and I think it’s an exciting opportunity at the same time. I believe it’s a very impactful contribution, both personally and for the company, to make AI computing more sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With M&amp;amp;A (at least from Meta) off the table, Paik declined to specify if the startup is now in pursuit of fresh funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Paik says this new partnership will lead to business possibilities far beyond South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“LG AI’s EXAONE is regarded as the leading sovereign AI model in South Korea. It won’t be used just within LG. It will be one of the main AI models used in the Korean AI ecosystem. We expect there will be many demands for this EXAONE, as well as for our chip solutions in South Korea, but not only in Korea. The LG team is also partnering with and doing business with global customers. So, we also expect this to be used by those customers, including global customers,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LG AI’s decision to adopt Furiosa’s AI chip and accelerator is notable for another reason: it’s one of the few public endorsements of a rival to Nvidia by a major enterprise, Paik said. One major reason for the win is that the startup’s hardware costs less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We had to prove that our solution not only delivers strong performance but also lowers total cost of ownership,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;FuriosaAI claims that its RNGD accelerator outperformed competitive GPUs with LG AI Research’s EXAONE models, delivering 2.25 times better inference performance. Paik also says that LG found the FuriosaAI hardware was more energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Furiosa’s chip is not a general GPU but was built exclusively for AI. “We can support a wide variety of AI models efficiently. But unlike GPUs, which are still fundamentally general-purpose processors, our architecture is natively built for AI computing. We do not develop our chip for rendering or mining,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Seoul-based startup, which also operates an office in Santa Clara, has a global team of just 15 employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI announced a partnership on Tuesday to supply its AI chip, RNGD, to enterprises using LG AI Research‘s recently unveiled EXAONE platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Latent Labs model has “achieved state-of-the-art on different metrics” when testing the proteins it developed in a physical lab, according to Latent Labs CEO and founder Simon Kohl, a scientist who previously co-led DeepMind’s AlphaFold’s protein design team. State-of-the-art, or SOTA, is a term often used in the AI field that represents the industry’s best performance to date on a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have computational ways of assessing how good the designs are,” he told TechCrunch, adding that a high percentage of proteins the model creates will be viable when tested in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company’s foundational biology model, known as LatentX, enables academic institutions, biotech startups, and pharmaceutical companies to design novel proteins directly in their browser using natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LatentX goes beyond what’s found in nature, creating entirely new molecule designs like nanobodies and antibodies with precise atomic structures. This approach can help develop new therapeutics at much faster rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This ability to design entirely new proteins is what distinguishes LatentX from the AlphaFold, according to Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Alpha fold is a model for protein structure prediction. So it allows you to visualize existing structures, but it doesn’t, it doesn’t let you generate new proteins,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In contrast to AI-driven drug discovery companies like Xaira, Recursion or DeepMind spinout Isomorphic Labs, which focus on developing proprietary medicines, Latent Labs’ business model involves licensing its model for use by external organizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Not every company is in a position to build their own AI models, to have their own AI infrastructure, and to have their own AI teams,” Kohl said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While LatentX is available for free, Kohl said the company intends to eventually charge for advanced features and capabilities as they’re introduced.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other companies providing open-sourced AI foundational models for drug discovery include Chai Discovery and EvolutionaryScale.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m sharing it here in case you’re interested. I think the talk has something for everyone. There’s some fun stuff in there. I even make jokes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;video&amp;nbsp;is now available (thank you, SXSW London).&amp;nbsp;Below is a quick look at my top five. Let me know if you would have picked different ones!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Generative AI is now so good it’s scary.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you think that’s obvious. But I am constantly having to check my assumptions about how fast this technology is progressing—and it’s my job to keep up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my colleague—and your regular Algorithm writer—James O’Donnell shared 10 music tracks with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;editorial team and challenged us to pick which ones had been produced using generative AI and which had been made by people. Pretty much everybody did worse than chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s happening with music is happening across media, from code to robotics to protein synthesis to video. Just look at what people are doing with new video-generation tools like Google DeepMind’s Veo 3. And this technology is being put into everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My point here? Whether you think AI is the best thing to happen to us or the worst, do not underestimate it. It’s good, and it’s getting better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Hallucination is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the fails. When AI makes up stuff, we call it hallucination. Think of customer service bots offering nonexistent refunds, lawyers submitting briefs filled with nonexistent cases, or RFK Jr.’s government department publishing a report that cites nonexistent academic papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear a lot of talk that makes hallucination sound like it’s a problem we need to fix. The more accurate way to think about hallucination is that this is exactly what generative AI does—what it’s meant to do—all the time. Generative models are trained to make things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s remarkable is not that they make up nonsense, but that the nonsense they make up so often matches reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why does this matter? First, we need to be aware of what this technology can and can’t do. But also: Don’t hold out for a future version that doesn’t hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. AI is power hungry and getting hungrier.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that AI is power hungry. But a lot of that reputation comes from the amount of electricity it takes to train these giant models, though giant models only get trained every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s changed is that these models are now being used by hundreds of millions of people every day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;And while using a model takes far less energy than training one, the energy costs ramp up massively with those kinds of user numbers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, for example, has 400 million weekly users. That makes it the fifth-most-visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. Other chatbots are catching up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s no surprise that tech companies are racing to build new data centers in the desert and revamp power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is we’ve been in the dark about exactly how much energy it takes to fuel this boom because none of the major companies building this technology have shared much information about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s starting to change, however. Several of my colleagues spent months working with researchers to crunch the numbers for some open source versions of this tech. (Do check out what they found.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Nobody knows exactly how large language models work.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, we know how to build them. We know how to make them work really well—see no. 1 on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how they do what they do is still an unsolved mystery. It’s like these things have arrived from outer space and scientists are poking and prodding them from the outside to figure out what they really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s incredible to think that never before has a mass-market technology used by billions of people been so little understood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does that matter? Well, until we understand them better we won’t know exactly what they can and can’t do. We won’t know how to control their behavior. We won’t fully understand hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. AGI doesn’t mean anything.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not long ago, talk of AGI was fringe, and mainstream researchers were embarrassed to bring it up.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;But as AI has got better and far more lucrative, serious people are happy to insist they’re about to create it. Whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGI—or artificial general intelligence—has come to mean something like: AI that can match the performance of humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean? How do we measure performance? Which humans? How wide a range of tasks? And performance on cognitive tasks is just another way of saying intelligence—so the definition is circular anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when people refer to AGI they now tend to just mean AI, but better than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this absolute faith in the progress of AI. It’s gotten better in the past, so it will continue to get better. But there is zero evidence that this will actually play out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us? We are building machines that are getting very good at mimicking some of the things people do, but the technology still has serious flaws. And we’re only just figuring out how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how I think about AI: We have built machines with humanlike behavior, but we haven’t shrugged off the habit of imagining a humanlike mind behind them.&lt;/strong&gt; This leads to exaggerated assumptions about what AI can do and plays into the wider culture wars between techno-optimists and techno-skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s right to be amazed by this technology. It’s also right to be skeptical of many of the things said about it.

I’m sharing it here in case you’re interested. I think the talk has something for everyone. There’s some fun stuff in there. I even make jokes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;video&amp;nbsp;is now available (thank you, SXSW London).&amp;nbsp;Below is a quick look at my top five. Let me know if you would have picked different ones!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Generative AI is now so good it’s scary.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you think that’s obvious. But I am constantly having to check my assumptions about how fast this technology is progressing—and it’s my job to keep up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my colleague—and your regular Algorithm writer—James O’Donnell shared 10 music tracks with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;editorial team and challenged us to pick which ones had been produced using generative AI and which had been made by people. Pretty much everybody did worse than chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s happening with music is happening across media, from code to robotics to protein synthesis to video. Just look at what people are doing with new video-generation tools like Google DeepMind’s Veo 3. And this technology is being put into everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My point here? Whether you think AI is the best thing to happen to us or the worst, do not underestimate it. It’s good, and it’s getting better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Hallucination is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the fails. When AI makes up stuff, we call it hallucination. Think of customer service bots offering nonexistent refunds, lawyers submitting briefs filled with nonexistent cases, or RFK Jr.’s government department publishing a report that cites nonexistent academic papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear a lot of talk that makes hallucination sound like it’s a problem we need to fix. The more accurate way to think about hallucination is that this is exactly what generative AI does—what it’s meant to do—all the time. Generative models are trained to make things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s remarkable is not that they make up nonsense, but that the nonsense they make up so often matches reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why does this matter? First, we need to be aware of what this technology can and can’t do. But also: Don’t hold out for a future version that doesn’t hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. AI is power hungry and getting hungrier.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that AI is power hungry. But a lot of that reputation comes from the amount of electricity it takes to train these giant models, though giant models only get trained every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s changed is that these models are now being used by hundreds of millions of people every day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;And while using a model takes far less energy than training one, the energy costs ramp up massively with those kinds of user numbers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, for example, has 400 million weekly users. That makes it the fifth-most-visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. Other chatbots are catching up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s no surprise that tech companies are racing to build new data centers in the desert and revamp power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is we’ve been in the dark about exactly how much energy it takes to fuel this boom because none of the major companies building this technology have shared much information about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s starting to change, however. Several of my colleagues spent months working with researchers to crunch the numbers for some open source versions of this tech. (Do check out what they found.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Nobody knows exactly how large language models work.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, we know how to build them. We know how to make them work really well—see no. 1 on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how they do what they do is still an unsolved mystery. It’s like these things have arrived from outer space and scientists are poking and prodding them from the outside to figure out what they really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s incredible to think that never before has a mass-market technology used by billions of people been so little understood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does that matter? Well, until we understand them better we won’t know exactly what they can and can’t do. We won’t know how to control their behavior. We won’t fully understand hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. AGI doesn’t mean anything.&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not long ago, talk of AGI was fringe, and mainstream researchers were embarrassed to bring it up.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;But as AI has got better and far more lucrative, serious people are happy to insist they’re about to create it. Whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGI—or artificial general intelligence—has come to mean something like: AI that can match the performance of humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean? How do we measure performance? Which humans? How wide a range of tasks? And performance on cognitive tasks is just another way of saying intelligence—so the definition is circular anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when people refer to AGI they now tend to just mean AI, but better than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this absolute faith in the progress of AI. It’s gotten better in the past, so it will continue to get better. But there is zero evidence that this will actually play out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us? We are building machines that are getting very good at mimicking some of the things people do, but the technology still has serious flaws. And we’re only just figuring out how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how I think about AI: We have built machines with humanlike behavior, but we haven’t shrugged off the habit of imagining a humanlike mind behind them.&lt;/strong&gt; This leads to exaggerated assumptions about what AI can do and plays into the wider culture wars between techno-optimists and techno-skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s right to be amazed by this technology. It’s also right to be skeptical of many of the things said about it. It’s still very early days, and it’s all up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From inside a modified trailer, I peeked through the window as a millimeter-wave drilling rig attached to an unassuming box truck melted a hole into a piece of basalt in less than two minutes. After the test was over, I stepped out of the trailer into the Houston heat. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. The company hopes it’s the key to unlocking geothermal energy and making it feasible anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Geothermal power tends to work best in those parts of the world that have the right geology and heat close to the surface. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth’s heat from anywhere on the globe.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s a difficult task, though. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. Instead, the company plans to use a gyrotron, a device that emits high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Today, the fusion power industry uses gyrotrons to heat plasma to 100 million °C, but Quaise plans to use them to blast, melt, and vaporize rock. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Since Quaise’s founding in 2018, the company has demonstrated that its systems work in the controlled conditions of the laboratory, and it has started trials in a semi-controlled environment, including the backyard of its Houston headquarters. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experts caution that reinventing drilling won’t be as simple, or as fast, as Quaise’s leadership hopes. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise’s big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blasting through&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we’re able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though that’s technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company’s goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It’s a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company’s main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works in practice: When Quaise’s rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it’s targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This system is what I saw in action at the company’s Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quaise truck and mobile drill unit" class="wp-image-1120477" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6268.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CASEY CROWNHART&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise isn’t the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that’s not the whole of what’s involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they’re drilled, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there’s a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocky roads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company’s investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it’s set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the company tests its 100-kilowatt systems at the rig and the quarry, the next step is an even larger system, which features a gyrotron that’s 10 times more powerful. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company’s technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The one-megawatt system actually needs a little over three megawatts of power overall, including the energy needed to run support equipment like cooling systems and the compressor that blows air into the hole, carrying the rock dust back up to the surface. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company’s vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that’s around 350 °C. The company plans to have it operational as early as 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. After it fires up the plant and begins producing electricity, the company can go back in and deepen the holes with millimeter-wave drilling in the future, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Quaise.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A drilling test shows Quaise's millimeter-wave technology drilling into a piece of granite. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it’ll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there’s a utility involved as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration’s tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One potential hurdle: drilling in different directions. Right now, millimeter-wave drilling can go in a straight line, straight down. Developing a geothermal plant like the one at the Oregon site will likely require what’s called directional drilling, the ability to drill in directions other than vertical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be&amp;nbsp; keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. “It’s eventually all about cost,” he says. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot more to learn—I mean, we’re reinventing drilling,” says Steve Jeske, a project manager at Quaise. “It seems like it shouldn’t work, but it does.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A beam of energy hit the slab of rock, which quickly began to glow.

The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though that’s technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company’s goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It’s a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company’s main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works in practice: When Quaise’s rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it’s targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This system is what I saw in action at the company’s Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quaise truck and mobile drill unit" class="wp-image-1120477" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6268.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CASEY CROWNHART&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise isn’t the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that’s not the whole of what’s involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they’re drilled, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there’s a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocky roads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company’s investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it’s set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the company tests its 100-kilowatt systems at the rig and the quarry, the next step is an even larger system, which features a gyrotron that’s 10 times more powerful. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company’s technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The one-megawatt system actually needs a little over three megawatts of power overall, including the energy needed to run support equipment like cooling systems and the compressor that blows air into the hole, carrying the rock dust back up to the surface. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company’s vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that’s around 350 °C. The company plans to have it operational as early as 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. After it fires up the plant and begins producing electricity, the company can go back in and deepen the holes with millimeter-wave drilling in the future, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Quaise.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A drilling test shows Quaise's millimeter-wave technology drilling into a piece of granite. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it’ll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there’s a utility involved as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration’s tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One potential hurdle: drilling in different directions. Right now, millimeter-wave drilling can go in a straight line, straight down. Developing a geothermal plant like the one at the Oregon site will likely require what’s called directional drilling, the ability to drill in directions other than vertical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be&amp;nbsp; keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quaise’s technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. “It’s eventually all about cost,” he says. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot more to learn—I mean, we’re reinventing drilling,” says Steve Jeske, a project manager at Quaise. “It seems like it shouldn’t work, but it does.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1120545/geothermal-drilling-quaise/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] This startup thinks email could be the key to usable AI agents (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/this-startup-thinks-email-could-be-the-key-to-usable-ai-agents/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI companies are pushing agents as the next Great Workplace Disruptor, but experts say they’re still not ready for prime time. AI agents often struggle to make decisions by themselves, hallucinate frequently, can’t cooperate with other agents, fail at confidentiality awareness, and integrate poorly with existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Industry pioneers like Andrej Karpathy and Ali Ghodsi have said that, like the deployment of autonomous vehicles, humans need to be in the loop in order for agents to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A startup called Mixus wants to address that with its AI agent platform that not only keeps humans in the workflow, it also lets users interact with agents directly from their email or Slack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re meeting customers where they are today,” Elliot Katz, Mixus’ co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Where is every person in the workforce today? For the most part, they’re on email. And so because we can do this through email, we believe that’s a way we can democratize access [to agents].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Mixus works reliably, it may solve a big problem in the AI agent space. Most AI companies today either give you a pre-built assistant, à la ChatGPT or Gemini, or developers have to build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or crewAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus launched in beta out of Stanford only in late 2024, but it has already raised $2.3 million in pre-seed funding and brought on some customers, including clothing store chain Rainbow Shops, as well as others across finance and tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup says its biggest selling point is ease of use, from how it helps you create agents to how you can interact with them. Users can use text prompts to set up their agents within Mixus’s platform via a chat function, or by simply emailing instructions to agent@mixus.com. Then Mixus will build, run, and manage single- or multi-step agents directly from the inbox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, a salesperson may use a prompt that reads so:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Create an agent that finds all open tasks in Jira in project mixus-dummy, and send me a report with information on all tasks that are overdue. Draft emails to all the assignees who have overdue tasks, and have me review them in the chat and with simple clear formatting for email (no attachments/docs). Once I verify, send the emails. Run it now. And moving forward, run it every Monday at 7am PST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3029966" height="339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mixus-email-agent-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Mixus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Katz and his co-founder Shai Magzimof demoed the agents for TechCrunch, showing how to add human verifiers for your agents by simply instructing at which step the agent should ask you for oversight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, they ran an agent to do research on TechCrunch reporters before pitching them. The agent identified and gathered technology news and trends, analyzed the information to identify potential story angles, and compiled a research report summarizing the findings. At the last stage, the agent was directed to send the information to Katz for verification. Once approved, the agent would send the completed research report to Magzimof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders noted that humans can be in the loop as much or as little as required — Magzimof said organizations can set up company-wide rules, like ensuring an email gets checked by a human if it’s being sent outside the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bringing other colleagues into the workflow is as easy as tagging them in the chat with an AI agent, or copying them on the email to the agent. That’s another standout compared to agents on the markets today: Most models are single-user, and while Notion AI and Slack allow users to collaborate in shared spaces, they don’t let the AI manage conversations and tasks between teammates in real time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another core feature of Mixus is its ability to remember files, chats, prompts and agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We created Spaces so that every team, every person, every group of people can have a shared memory,” Magzimof said. “Then all my agents, all my files, all the people can be in that very specific Space’s memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While ChatGPT and Claude both support memory, their enterprise plans don’t yet support shared agent memory across users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-can-mixus-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can Mixus do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In our interview, the founders ran through an hour-long demo showing a range of use cases and abilities. Mixus’ agents do seem capable, reflecting a high degree of autonomy and memory that places the company towards the higher end of the AI agent spectrum. That is, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the product works as reliably as it did in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other agents, Mixus can integrate with other tools, from Gmail to Jira, and users can trigger agents to run immediately or on a schedule.&amp;nbsp;Agents can run and edit documents or spreadsheets inline — similar to ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, but those are often limited to sandboxed environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixus also lets agents autonomously navigate organizational context — like figuring out who in an organization owns a task by looking through Jira tickets. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Built on a combination of Anthropic’s Claude 4 and OpenAI’s o3, Mixus agents also have access to the web, which Magzimof says can be tapped for tasks like live research or monitoring. He described it as “Google Alerts on steroids.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Taken together, Mixus appears to be less of a productivity tool and more like a tireless digital colleague – yet another ambitious attempt to reimagine AI as a collaborator. If it works as advertised, your next “coworker” might not be human, but it might get through your inbox faster than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Will Douglas Heaven, senior editor for AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last month I gave a talk at SXSW London called “Five things you need to know about AI”—my personal picks for the five most important ideas in AI right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I aimed the talk at a general audience, and it serves as a quick tour of how I’m thinking about AI in 2025. There’s some fun stuff in there. I even make jokes!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can now watch the video of my talk, but if you want to see the five I chose right now, here is a quick look at them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

But when it deployed it in the real world, it still couldn’t remove biases. So why did Amsterdam fail?
