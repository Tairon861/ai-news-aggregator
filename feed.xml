The industry’s focus is shifting toward agents—systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and negotiate on users’ behalf. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what would happen if both a customer and a seller were using an AI agent? A recent study put agent-to-agent negotiations to the test and found that stronger agents can exploit weaker ones to get a better deal. It’s a bit like entering court with a seasoned attorney versus a rookie: You’re technically playing the same game, but the odds are skewed from the start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper, posted to arXiv’s preprint site, found that access to more advanced AI models —those with greater reasoning ability, better training data, and more parameters—could lead to consistently better financial deals, potentially widening the gap between people with greater resources and technical access and those without. If agent-to-agent interactions become the norm, disparities in AI capabilities could quietly deepen existing inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Over time, this could create a digital divide where your financial outcomes are shaped less by your negotiating skill and more by the strength of your AI proxy,” says Jiaxin Pei, a postdoc researcher at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their experiment, the researchers had AI models play the roles of buyers and sellers in three scenarios, negotiating deals for electronics, motor vehicles, and real estate. Each seller agent received the product’s specs, wholesale cost, and retail price, with instructions to maximize profit. Buyer agents, in contrast, were given a budget, the retail price, and ideal product requirements and were tasked with driving the price down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each agent had some, but not all, relevant details. This setup mimics many real-world negotiation conditions, where parties lack full visibility into each other’s constraints or objectives.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The differences in performance were striking. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-o3 delivered the strongest overall negotiation results, followed by the company’s GPT-4.1 and o4-mini. GPT-3.5, which came out almost two years earlier and is the oldest model included in the study,&amp;nbsp; lagged significantly in both roles—it made the least money as the seller and spent the most as a buyer. DeepSeek R1 and V3 also performed well, particularly as sellers. Qwen2.5 trailed behind, though it showed more strength in the buyer role.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable pattern was that some agents often failed to close deals but effectively maximize profit in the sales they did make, while others completed more negotiations but settled for lower margins. GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1 struck the best balance, achieving both solid profits and high completion rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond financial losses, the researchers found that AI agents could get stuck in prolonged negotiation loops without reaching an agreement—or end talks prematurely, even when instructed to push for the best possible deal. Even the most capable models were prone to these failures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The result was very surprising to us,” says Pei. “We all believe LLMs are pretty good these days, but they can be untrustworthy in high-stakes scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disparity in negotiation performance could be caused by a number of factors, says Pei. These include differences in training data and the models’ ability to reason and infer missing information. The precise causes remain uncertain, but one factor seems clear: Model size plays a significant role. According to the scaling laws of large language models, capabilities tend to improve with an increase in the number of parameters. This trend held true in the study: Even within the same model family, larger models were consistently able to strike better deals as both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is part of a growing body of research warning about the risks of deploying AI agents in real-world financial decision-making. Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their risk profiles, not just their peak performance. Current benchmarks, they say, emphasize accuracy and return-based metrics, which measure how well an agent can perform at its best but overlook how safely it can fail. Their research also found that even top-performing models are more likely to break down under adversarial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The team suggests that in the context of real-world finances, a tiny weakness—even a 1% failure rate—could expose the system to systemic risks. They recommend that AI agents be “stress tested” before being put into practical use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hancheng Cao, an incoming assistant professor at Emory University, notes that the price negotiation study has limitations. “The experiments were conducted in simulated environments that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world negotiations or user behavior,” says Cao.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Pei, the researcher, says researchers and industry practitioners are experimenting with a variety of strategies to reduce these risks. These include refining the prompts given to AI agents, enabling agents to use external tools or code to make better decisions, coordinating multiple models to double-check each other’s work, and fine-tuning models on domain-specific financial data—all of which have shown promise in improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many prominent AI shopping tools are currently limited to product recommendation. In April, for example, Amazon launched “Buy for Me,” an AI agent that helps customers find and buy products from other brands’ sites if Amazon doesn’t sell them directly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While price negotiation is rare in consumer e-commerce, it’s more common in business-to-business transactions. Alibaba.com has rolled out a sourcing assistant called Accio, built on its open-source Qwen models, that helps businesses find suppliers and research products. The company told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; it has no plans to automate price bargaining so far, citing high risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That may be a wise move. For now, Pei advises consumers to treat AI shopping assistants as helpful tools—not stand-ins for humans in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we are fully ready to delegate our decisions to AI shopping agents,” he says. “So maybe just use it as an information tool, not a negotiator.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: We removed a line about agent deployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/handshake.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The race to build ever larger AI models is slowing down.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in February, I flew to Amsterdam to report on a high-stakes experiment the city had recently conducted: a pilot program for what it called Smart Check, which was its attempt to create an effective, fair, and unbiased predictive algorithm to try to detect welfare fraud. But the city fell short of its lofty goals—and, with our partners at Lighthouse Reports and the Dutch newspaper &lt;em&gt;Trouw&lt;/em&gt;, we tried to get to the bottom of why. You can read about it in our deep dive published last week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For an American reporter, it’s been an interesting time to write a story on “responsible AI” in a progressive European city—just as ethical considerations in AI deployments appear to be disappearing in the United States, at least at the national level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a few weeks before my trip, the Trump administration rescinded Biden’s executive order on AI safety and DOGE began turning to AI to decide which federal programs to cut. Then, more recently, House Republicans passed a 10-year moratorium on US states’ ability to regulate AI (though it has yet to be passed by the Senate).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What all this points to is a new reality in the United States where responsible AI is no longer a priority (if it ever genuinely was).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Amsterdam’s welfare department began developing the algorithm that became Smart Check, the municipality followed virtually every recommendation in the responsible-AI playbook: consulting external experts, running bias tests, implementing technical safeguards, and seeking stakeholder feedback. City officials hoped the resulting algorithm could avoid causing the worst types of harm inflicted by discriminatory AI over nearly a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After talking to a large number of people involved in the project and others who would potentially be affected by it, as well as some experts who did not work on it, it’s hard not to wonder if the city could ever have succeeded in its goals when neither “fairness” nor even “bias” has a universally agreed-upon definition. &lt;strong&gt;The city was treating these issues as technical ones that could be answered by reweighting numbers and figures—rather than political and philosophical questions that society as a whole has to grapple with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the afternoon that I arrived in Amsterdam, I sat down with Anke van der Vliet, a longtime advocate for welfare beneficiaries who served on what’s called the Participation Council, a 15-member citizen body that represents benefits recipients and their advocates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The city had consulted the council during Smart Check’s development, but van der Vliet was blunt in sharing the committee’s criticisms of the plans. Its members simply didn’t want the program. They had well-placed fears of discrimination and disproportionate impact, given that fraud is found in only 3% of applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the city’s credit, it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; respond to some of their concerns and make changes in the algorithm’s design—like removing from consideration factors, such as age, whose inclusion could have had a discriminatory impact. But the city ignored the Participation Council’s main feedback: its recommendation to stop development altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Vliet and other welfare advocates I met on my trip, like representatives from the Amsterdam Welfare Union, described what they see as a number of challenges faced by the city’s some 35,000 benefits recipients: the indignities of having to constantly re-prove the need for benefits, the increases in cost of living that benefits payments do not reflect, and the general feeling of distrust between recipients and the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;City welfare officials themselves recognize the flaws of the system, which “is held together by rubber bands and staples,” as Harry Bodaar, a senior policy advisor to the city who focuses on welfare fraud enforcement, told us. “And if you’re at the bottom of that system, you’re the first to fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the Participation Council didn’t want Smart Check at all, even as Bodaar and others working in the department hoped that it could fix the system. It’s a classic example of a “wicked problem,” a social or cultural issue with no one clear answer and many potential consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the story was published, I heard from Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a former tech advisor to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-wrote Biden’s AI Bill of Rights (now rescinded by Trump). “We need participation early on from communities,” he said, but he added that it also matters what officials do with the feedback—and whether there is “a willingness to reframe the intervention based on what people actually want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had the city started with a different question—what people actually want—perhaps it might have developed a different algorithm entirely.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Dutch digital rights advocate Hans De Zwart put it to us, “We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems … why doesn’t the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of fundamental questions AI developers will need to consider, or they run the risk of repeating (or ignoring) the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Venkatasubramanian told me he found the story to be “affirming” in highlighting the need for “those in charge of governing these systems”&amp;nbsp; to “ask hard questions … starting with whether they should be used at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he also called the story “humbling”: “Even with good intentions, and a desire to benefit from all the research on responsible AI, it’s still possible to build systems that are fundamentally flawed, for reasons that go well beyond the details of the system constructions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To better understand this debate, read our full story here. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you want more detail on how we ran our own bias tests after the city gave us unprecedented access to the Smart Check algorithm, check out the methodology over at Lighthouse.

You can read about it in our deep dive published last week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For an American reporter, it’s been an interesting time to write a story on “responsible AI” in a progressive European city—just as ethical considerations in AI deployments appear to be disappearing in the United States, at least at the national level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a few weeks before my trip, the Trump administration rescinded Biden’s executive order on AI safety and DOGE began turning to AI to decide which federal programs to cut. Then, more recently, House Republicans passed a 10-year moratorium on US states’ ability to regulate AI (though it has yet to be passed by the Senate).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What all this points to is a new reality in the United States where responsible AI is no longer a priority (if it ever genuinely was).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Amsterdam’s welfare department began developing the algorithm that became Smart Check, the municipality followed virtually every recommendation in the responsible-AI playbook: consulting external experts, running bias tests, implementing technical safeguards, and seeking stakeholder feedback. City officials hoped the resulting algorithm could avoid causing the worst types of harm inflicted by discriminatory AI over nearly a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After talking to a large number of people involved in the project and others who would potentially be affected by it, as well as some experts who did not work on it, it’s hard not to wonder if the city could ever have succeeded in its goals when neither “fairness” nor even “bias” has a universally agreed-upon definition. &lt;strong&gt;The city was treating these issues as technical ones that could be answered by reweighting numbers and figures—rather than political and philosophical questions that society as a whole has to grapple with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the afternoon that I arrived in Amsterdam, I sat down with Anke van der Vliet, a longtime advocate for welfare beneficiaries who served on what’s called the Participation Council, a 15-member citizen body that represents benefits recipients and their advocates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The city had consulted the council during Smart Check’s development, but van der Vliet was blunt in sharing the committee’s criticisms of the plans. Its members simply didn’t want the program. They had well-placed fears of discrimination and disproportionate impact, given that fraud is found in only 3% of applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the city’s credit, it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; respond to some of their concerns and make changes in the algorithm’s design—like removing from consideration factors, such as age, whose inclusion could have had a discriminatory impact. But the city ignored the Participation Council’s main feedback: its recommendation to stop development altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Vliet and other welfare advocates I met on my trip, like representatives from the Amsterdam Welfare Union, described what they see as a number of challenges faced by the city’s some 35,000 benefits recipients: the indignities of having to constantly re-prove the need for benefits, the increases in cost of living that benefits payments do not reflect, and the general feeling of distrust between recipients and the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;City welfare officials themselves recognize the flaws of the system, which “is held together by rubber bands and staples,” as Harry Bodaar, a senior policy advisor to the city who focuses on welfare fraud enforcement, told us. “And if you’re at the bottom of that system, you’re the first to fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the Participation Council didn’t want Smart Check at all, even as Bodaar and others working in the department hoped that it could fix the system. It’s a classic example of a “wicked problem,” a social or cultural issue with no one clear answer and many potential consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the story was published, I heard from Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a former tech advisor to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-wrote Biden’s AI Bill of Rights (now rescinded by Trump). “We need participation early on from communities,” he said, but he added that it also matters what officials do with the feedback—and whether there is “a willingness to reframe the intervention based on what people actually want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had the city started with a different question—what people actually want—perhaps it might have developed a different algorithm entirely.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Dutch digital rights advocate Hans De Zwart put it to us, “We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems … why doesn’t the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of fundamental questions AI developers will need to consider, or they run the risk of repeating (or ignoring) the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Venkatasubramanian told me he found the story to be “affirming” in highlighting the need for “those in charge of governing these systems”&amp;nbsp; to “ask hard questions … starting with whether they should be used at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he also called the story “humbling”: “Even with good intentions, and a desire to benefit from all the research on responsible AI, it’s still possible to build systems that are fundamentally flawed, for reasons that go well beyond the details of the system constructions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To better understand this debate, read our full story here. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you want more detail on how we ran our own bias tests after the city gave us unprecedented access to the Smart Check algorithm, check out the methodology over at Lighthouse.

A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Suárez Vázquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing—a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico’s ubiquitous coquí frog. It’s in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn’t know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes’ drive down the road is Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile—towering more than 12 stories high—out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has signed a new law rolling back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 2000—before the coal plant opened—Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico’s central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209—a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the “operation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company” as “a case of environmental injustice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Seemingly everyone Suárez Vázquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who’s sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“In one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,” she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo’s face was printed. “It’s disgraceful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down—as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118414" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF6381.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Carmen Suárez Vázquez clutches a pillow with a portraits of her daughter and late son Edgardo. When this photograph was taken, she had just been released from the hospital, where she underwent treatment for lung inflammation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER C. KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suárez Vázquez had hoped that relief would be on the way by now. That the billions of dollars Congress designated for fixing the island’s infrastructure would have made solar panels ubiquitous. That AES’s coal plant, which for nearly a quarter century has supplied up to 20% of the old, faulty electrical grid’s power, would be near its end—its closure had been set for late 2027. That the Caribbean’s first virtual power plant—a decentralized network of solar panels and batteries that could be remotely tapped into and used to balance the grid like a centralized fuel-burning station—would be well on its way to establishing a new model for the troubled island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico’s power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer González-Colón serving as Puerto Rico’s governor, America’s largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico’s lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, González-Colón issued an executive order fast-­tracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for “practical fixes and emergency activities” to improve the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico’s grid before what’s forecast to be a hotter-than-­average summer—and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory’s elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory’s state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April González-Colón moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118416" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8754.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Alberto Colón, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, helped install her solar panels.

KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="close up of a hand holding a paper towel with a gritty black streak on it" class="wp-image-1118415" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8747.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Colón shows some of the soot wiped from the side of his house.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER C. KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, she’s trying to enforce a separate contract with New Fortress Energy, the New York–based natural-gas company that gained control of Puerto Rico’s state-owned power plants in a hotly criticized privatization deal in 2023—all while the company is pushing to build more gas-fired generating stations to increase the island’s demand for liquefied natural gas. Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico—despite the company’s failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers’ lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory’s finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters’ ability to steer their own fate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AES declined an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for González-Colón responded to repeated requests for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was born on Puerto Rico’s Emancipation Day, but I’m not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,” says Alberto Colón, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. “I have sinus problems, and I’m lucky. My wife has many, many health problems. It’s gotten really bad in the last few years. Even with screens in the windows, the dust gets into the house.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt—a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don’t have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don’t typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don’t benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government—the US federal government—that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A phrase that’s ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: &lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia—&lt;/em&gt;the problem is the colony.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world’s oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called “the white man’s burden”—the duty to civilize his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal had modernized the island’s infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer’s plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island’s middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the “belle of the bond markets.” By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-­owned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a “possession” of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature—in which the island’s elected delegate had no vote—to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act—shortened to PROMESA, or “promise” in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island’s elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island’s autonomy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,” Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another “colonial experiment.” “The democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected ‘with all deliberate speed.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-­destroying electrical surges were distressingly common.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The spotty service wasn’t the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico’s great blackout. The fiscal control board—which critics pejoratively referred to as “la junta,” using a term typically reserved for Latin America’s most notorious military dictatorships—saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy—a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO—to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A deadly diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until that point, life was looking up for Suárez Vázquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They were courting him,” Suárez Vázquez says. “He was going to graduate with a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo’s case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ewing’s sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had—extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone—is even rarer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, there’s scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found “no well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,” researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to “small, retrospective, case-control studies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dependable sun&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The push to give control over the territory’s power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn’t lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island’s residents. Last year, when the Biden administration’s Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="worker crouching on a roof to install solar panels" class="wp-image-1118412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21309469874938.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 have enrolled in a pilot project aimed at providing backup power to the grid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GDA VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico’s energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board’s lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created “a precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.” In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging “the importance of developing renewable energy projects.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau “negotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices” on a handful of projects, says Javier Rúa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar &amp;amp; Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “Then the fiscal board—in my opinion arbitrarily—canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government’s local experts will be final. “There’s no trust,” says Rúa-Jovet. “That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing “deep structural inefficiencies” that “ultimately delayed progress” toward Puerto Rico’s renewables goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, Rúa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts—eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The share of renewables on Puerto Rico’s power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress’s request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,” says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She’d be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on “smaller-­scale natural-gas plants” that could be used to back up renewables, but “what they’re talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.” She says, “That’s just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn’t require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avilés-Ríos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,” she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. “The pollution impact alone would be horrible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months—but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they’d pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico’s contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden’s senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the “troubling” fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run—disincentivizing any transition to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Territories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,” she told me. “The Trump administration’s emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-­energy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico’s other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Puerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant’s generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can’t turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,” Rúa-Jovet says. “That’s just a physical fact.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lowest-cost energy, depending on who’s paying the price&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island’s bondholders. “From a bondholder perspective, [it’s] the lowest cost,” she explains. “From the client and user perspective, it’s the lowest cost. It’s always been the cheapest form of energy down there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy,” says Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez. He says he’s had cancer twice already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, “the government ends up paying the expense of people’s asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old.&amp;nbsp;“So many people have died,” Suárez Vázquez told me, choking back tears. “They contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black. My son’s insides were black. This never ends.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118413" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25107124641123.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Customers sit inside a restaurant lit by battery-powered lanterns. On April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AP PHOTO/ALEJANDRO GRANADILLO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor do the blackouts. At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico’s central mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Come to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,” the group beckoned, “where we have electricity and internet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander C.

A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Suárez Vázquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing—a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico’s ubiquitous coquí frog. It’s in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn’t know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes’ drive down the road is Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile—towering more than 12 stories high—out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has signed a new law rolling back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 2000—before the coal plant opened—Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico’s central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209—a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the “operation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company” as “a case of environmental injustice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Seemingly everyone Suárez Vázquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who’s sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“In one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,” she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo’s face was printed. “It’s disgraceful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down—as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118414" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF6381.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Carmen Suárez Vázquez clutches a pillow with a portraits of her daughter and late son Edgardo.

KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suárez Vázquez had hoped that relief would be on the way by now. That the billions of dollars Congress designated for fixing the island’s infrastructure would have made solar panels ubiquitous. That AES’s coal plant, which for nearly a quarter century has supplied up to 20% of the old, faulty electrical grid’s power, would be near its end—its closure had been set for late 2027. That the Caribbean’s first virtual power plant—a decentralized network of solar panels and batteries that could be remotely tapped into and used to balance the grid like a centralized fuel-burning station—would be well on its way to establishing a new model for the troubled island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico’s power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer González-Colón serving as Puerto Rico’s governor, America’s largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico’s lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, González-Colón issued an executive order fast-­tracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for “practical fixes and emergency activities” to improve the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico’s grid before what’s forecast to be a hotter-than-­average summer—and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory’s elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory’s state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April González-Colón moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico—despite the company’s failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers’ lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory’s finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters’ ability to steer their own fate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AES declined an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for González-Colón responded to repeated requests for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was born on Puerto Rico’s Emancipation Day, but I’m not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,” says Alberto Colón, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. “I have sinus problems, and I’m lucky. My wife has many, many health problems. It’s gotten really bad in the last few years. Even with screens in the windows, the dust gets into the house.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt—a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don’t have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don’t typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don’t benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government—the US federal government—that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A phrase that’s ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: &lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia—&lt;/em&gt;the problem is the colony.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world’s oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called “the white man’s burden”—the duty to civilize his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal had modernized the island’s infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer’s plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island’s middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the “belle of the bond markets.” By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-­owned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a “possession” of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature—in which the island’s elected delegate had no vote—to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act—shortened to PROMESA, or “promise” in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island’s elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island’s autonomy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,” Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another “colonial experiment.” “The democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected ‘with all deliberate speed.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-­destroying electrical surges were distressingly common.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The spotty service wasn’t the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico’s great blackout. The fiscal control board—which critics pejoratively referred to as “la junta,” using a term typically reserved for Latin America’s most notorious military dictatorships—saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy—a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO—to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A deadly diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until that point, life was looking up for Suárez Vázquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They were courting him,” Suárez Vázquez says. “He was going to graduate with a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo’s case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ewing’s sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had—extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone—is even rarer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, there’s scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found “no well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,” researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to “small, retrospective, case-control studies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dependable sun&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The push to give control over the territory’s power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn’t lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island’s residents. Last year, when the Biden administration’s Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="worker crouching on a roof to install solar panels" class="wp-image-1118412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21309469874938.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 have enrolled in a pilot project aimed at providing backup power to the grid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GDA VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico’s energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board’s lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created “a precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.” In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging “the importance of developing renewable energy projects.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau “negotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices” on a handful of projects, says Javier Rúa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar &amp;amp; Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “Then the fiscal board—in my opinion arbitrarily—canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government’s local experts will be final. “There’s no trust,” says Rúa-Jovet. “That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing “deep structural inefficiencies” that “ultimately delayed progress” toward Puerto Rico’s renewables goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, Rúa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts—eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The share of renewables on Puerto Rico’s power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress’s request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,” says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She’d be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on “smaller-­scale natural-gas plants” that could be used to back up renewables, but “what they’re talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.” She says, “That’s just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn’t require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avilés-Ríos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,” she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. “The pollution impact alone would be horrible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months—but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they’d pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico’s contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden’s senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the “troubling” fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run—disincentivizing any transition to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Territories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,” she told me. “The Trump administration’s emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-­energy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico’s other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Puerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant’s generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can’t turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,” Rúa-Jovet says. “That’s just a physical fact.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lowest-cost energy, depending on who’s paying the price&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island’s bondholders. “From a bondholder perspective, [it’s] the lowest cost,” she explains. “From the client and user perspective, it’s the lowest cost. It’s always been the cheapest form of energy down there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy,” says Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez. He says he’s had cancer twice already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, “the government ends up paying the expense of people’s asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old.&amp;nbsp;“So many people have died,” Suárez Vázquez told me, choking back tears. “They contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black. My son’s insides were black. This never ends.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118413" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25107124641123.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Customers sit inside a restaurant lit by battery-powered lanterns.

At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico’s central mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Come to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,” the group beckoned, “where we have electricity and internet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander C.

I often steal time for visits like this—a perk of global business travel for which I am grateful. Wandering the galleries, I found myself before &lt;em&gt;The Courtesan (after Eisen)&lt;/em&gt;, painted in 1887. Van Gogh had based it on a Japanese woodblock print by Keisai Eisen, which he encountered in the magazine &lt;em&gt;Paris Illustré&lt;/em&gt;. He explicitly copied and reinterpreted Eisen’s composition, adding his own vivid border of frogs, cranes, and bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I stood there, I imagined the painting as the product of a generative AI model prompted with the query &lt;em&gt;How would van Gogh reinterpret a Japanese woodblock in the style of Keisai Eisen?&lt;/em&gt; And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?&amp;nbsp; If van Gogh were working today, that might be the case. Two years ago, the US Supreme Court found that Andy Warhol had infringed upon the photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s copyright by using her photo of the musician Prince for a series of silkscreens. The court said the works were not sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use—a provision in the law that allows for others to make limited use of copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months later, at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, I visited a Salvador Dalí exhibition. I had always thought of Dalí as a true original genius who conjured surreal visions out of thin air. But the show included several Dutch engravings, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s &lt;em&gt;Seven Deadly Sins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(1558), that clearly influenced Dalí’s &lt;em&gt;8 Mortal Sins Suite&lt;/em&gt; (1966). The stylistic differences are significant, but the lineage is undeniable. Dalí himself cited Bruegel as a surrealist forerunner, someone who tapped into the same dream logic and bizarre forms that Dalí celebrated. Suddenly, I was seeing Dalí not just as an original but also as a reinterpreter. Should Bruegel have been flattered that Dalí built on his work—or should he have sued him for making it so “grotesque”?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a later visit to a Picasso exhibit in Milan, I came across a famous informational diagram by the art historian Alfred Barr, mapping how modernist movements like Cubism evolved from earlier artistic traditions. Picasso is often held up as one of modern art’s most original and influential figures, but Barr’s chart made plain the many artists he drew from—Goya, El Greco, Cézanne, African sculptors. This made me wonder: If a generative AI model had been fed all those inputs, might it have produced Cubism? Could it have generated the next great artistic “breakthrough”?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These experiences—spread across three cities and centered on three iconic artists—coalesced into a broader reflection I’d already begun. I had recently spoken with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, about how restrictive copyright laws are in music. Song arrangements and lyrics enjoy longer protection than many pharmaceutical patents. Ek sits at the leading edge of this debate, and he observed that generative AI already produces an astonishing range of music. Some of it is good. Much of it is terrible. But nearly all of it borrows from the patterns and structures of existing work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Musicians already routinely sue one another for borrowing from previous works. How will the law adapt to a form of artistry that’s driven by prompts and precedent, built entirely on a corpus of existing material?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And the questions don’t stop there. Who, exactly, owns the outputs of a generative model? The user who crafted the prompt? The developer who built the model? The artists whose works were ingested to train it? Will the social forces that shape artistic standing—critics, curators, tastemakers—still hold sway? Or will a new, AI-era hierarchy emerge? If every artist has always borrowed from others, is AI’s generative recombination really so different? And in such a litigious culture, how long can copyright law hold its current form? The US Copyright Office has begun to tackle the thorny issues of ownership and says that generative outputs can be copyrighted if they are sufficiently human-authored. But it is playing catch-up in a rapidly evolving field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Different industries are responding in different ways. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that filmmakers’ use of generative AI would not disqualify them from Oscar contention—and that they wouldn’t be required to disclose when they’d used the technology. Several acclaimed films, including Oscar winner &lt;em&gt;The Brutalist&lt;/em&gt;, incorporated AI into their production processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The music world, meanwhile, continues to wrestle with its definitions of originality. Consider the recent lawsuit against Ed Sheeran. In 2016, he was sued by the heirs of Ed Townsend, co-writer of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On,” who claimed that Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud” copied the earlier song’s melody, harmony, and rhythm. When the case finally went to trial in 2023, Sheeran brought a guitar to the stand. He played the disputed four-chord progression—I–iii–IV–V—and wove together a mash-up of songs built on the same foundation. The point was clear: These are the elemental units of songwriting. After a brief deliberation, the jury found Sheeran not liable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflecting after the trial, Sheeran said: “These chords are common building blocks … No one owns them or the way they’re played, in the same way no one owns the colour blue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly. Whether it’s expressed with a guitar, a paintbrush, or a generative algorithm, creativity has always been built on what came before.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t consider this essay to be great art. But I should be transparent: I relied extensively on ChatGPT while drafting it. I began with a rough outline, notes typed on my phone in museum galleries, and transcripts from conversations with colleagues. I uploaded older writing samples to give the model a sense of my voice. Then I used the tool to shape a draft, which I revised repeatedly—by hand and with help from an editor—over several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There may still be phrases or sentences in here that came directly from the model. But I’ve iterated so much that I no longer know which ones. Nor, I suspect, could any reader—or any AI detector. (In fact, Grammarly found that 0% of this text appeared to be AI-generated.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many people today remain uneasy about using these tools. They worry it’s cheating, or feel embarrassed to admit that they’ve sought such help. I’ve moved past that. I assume all my students at Harvard Business School are using AI. I assume most academic research begins with literature scanned and synthesized by these models. And I assume that many of the essays I now read in leading publications were shaped, at least in part, by generative tools.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Why? Because we are professionals. And professionals adopt efficiency tools early. Generative AI joins a long lineage that includes the word processor, the search engine, and editing tools like Grammarly. The question is no longer &lt;em&gt;Who’s using AI?&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Why wouldn’t you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I recognize the counterargument, notably put forward by Nicholas Thompson, CEO of the&lt;em&gt; Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;: that content produced with AI assistance should not be eligible for copyright protection, because it blurs the boundaries of authorship. I understand the instinct. AI recombines vast corpora of preexisting work, and the results can feel derivative or machine-like.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I reflect on the history of creativity—van Gogh reworking Eisen, Dalí channeling Bruegel, Sheeran defending common musical DNA—I’m reminded that recombination has always been central to creation. The economist Joseph Schumpeter famously wrote that innovation is less about invention than “the novel reassembly of existing ideas.” If we tried to trace and assign ownership to every prior influence, we’d grind creativity to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the outset, I knew the tools had transformative potential. What I underestimated was how quickly they would become ubiquitous across industries and in my own daily work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our copyright system has never required total originality. It demands meaningful human input. That standard should apply in the age of AI as well. When people thoughtfully engage with these models—choosing prompts, curating inputs, shaping the results—they are creating. The medium has changed, but the impulse remains the same: to build something new from the materials we inherit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitin Nohria is the George F.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the influx of cash, the startup is looking to expand its engineering base in India and develop its AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity and all-primary Series E round is led by California-based venture growth firm NewView Capital, with participation from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and NextEquity, the venture firm founded by former Apple executives Avie Tevanian and Fred Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data observability has become increasingly important nowadays as more companies store and leverage data to capitalize on the benefits of AI. However, not everyone in a company has the time or resources to thoroughly investigate an issue or make an important decision based on their data stream. Coralogix aims to solve this challenge with its AI observability agent, Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent utilizes a semantic layer that incorporates internal data, including metadata, along with external sources, such as information available on the internet, to assist companies in understanding complex issues, such as identifying the causes of slow service or resolving the most common system errors, by using simple text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trained to answer broader questions than just what is going wrong, the AI agent can help customers if they want to know which feature is causing customers the most frustration, how much these customers are paying, or who their account representative is that can work with them, Coralogix co-founder and CEO Ariel Assaraf said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Olly includes features such as anomaly detection, access monitoring, and real-time alerts to automate data observability for customers. It was developed by Coralogix’s AI research center, which it now aims to expand through its new capital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside its AI agent, Coralogix provides observability and guardrails to AI companies, offering them insights into the performance of their models, as well as the quality, security, and governance of their responses. All this came through Aporia’s acquisition in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s an opportunity for us, given our architecture of analyzing stream query from remote, lower costs. We’re going to invest a lot there and build out the AI research center bigger,” Assaraf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to leverage India’s engineering base for its AI ambitions, aiming to invest about $100 million in the country over the next five years. The investment is planned to expand its office in Gurugram and hire more staff in Bengaluru and Mumbai to build engineering, R&amp;amp;D, and customer success teams.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of its overall headcount of nearly 550 employees, Coralogix has about 250 people in Israel and 100 in India. It plans to double the Indian employee base over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we see just a really good fit between the Israeli engineering culture and Indian engineering culture, it’s a get-it-done, very independent, very committed to the mission type of engineering that we see a very good fit for us to expand into,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The South Asian market is also the startup’s second-largest market in terms of revenue and user base, with over 100 customers, after the U.S., the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian companies such as Postman, Jupiter Money, Meesho, BookMyShow, BharatPe, CoinDCX, and Razorpay are among Coralogix’s customers. It also serves banks and enterprises and is looking to tap the Indian government as its next big client. Furthermore, the startup is eyeing the acquisition of Indian startups to expand its footprint in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have spoken to quite a few Indian companies about the potential M&amp;amp;A, but nothing has really been fulfilled. It could be a very good and easy way for us to get a strong core team as we think about expanding our engineering,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2022, Coralogix raised $142 million in a Series D round co-led by Advent International and Brighton Park Capital. Since then, Assaraf said the startup has seen 7x growth in its revenues, although it’s not yet profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup, which views Datadog as its key competitor, aims to file for a U.S. IPO on Nasdaq in three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is we build this new way of architecture, analyzing stream query from remote, this new way of customer engagement, these new geographies that we’re invested in now, also this new AI experience, how you monitor AI and how you use AI to monitor,” Assaraf said. After it can show progress on these fronts, it will explore an IPO, he added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest round also saw participation from Coralogix’s existing investors, including Advent International, Brighton Park Capital, Revaia, Greenfield Partners, Red Dot Capital Partners, O.G. Venture Partners, Joule Capital Partners, and Maor Investments.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-885762064-e1675765834982.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Coralogix, an Israeli startup offering a full-stack observability and security platform, has raised $115 million at a pre-money valuation of over $1 billion, almost doubling in three years from its last round in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the influx of cash, the startup is looking to expand its engineering base in India and develop its AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity and all-primary Series E round is led by California-based venture growth firm NewView Capital, with participation from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and NextEquity, the venture firm founded by former Apple executives Avie Tevanian and Fred Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data observability has become increasingly important nowadays as more companies store and leverage data to capitalize on the benefits of AI. However, not everyone in a company has the time or resources to thoroughly investigate an issue or make an important decision based on their data stream. Coralogix aims to solve this challenge with its AI observability agent, Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent utilizes a semantic layer that incorporates internal data, including metadata, along with external sources, such as information available on the internet, to assist companies in understanding complex issues, such as identifying the causes of slow service or resolving the most common system errors, by using simple text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trained to answer broader questions than just what is going wrong, the AI agent can help customers if they want to know which feature is causing customers the most frustration, how much these customers are paying, or who their account representative is that can work with them, Coralogix co-founder and CEO Ariel Assaraf said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Olly includes features such as anomaly detection, access monitoring, and real-time alerts to automate data observability for customers. It was developed by Coralogix’s AI research center, which it now aims to expand through its new capital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside its AI agent, Coralogix provides observability and guardrails to AI companies, offering them insights into the performance of their models, as well as the quality, security, and governance of their responses. All this came through Aporia’s acquisition in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s an opportunity for us, given our architecture of analyzing stream query from remote, lower costs. We’re going to invest a lot there and build out the AI research center bigger,” Assaraf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to leverage India’s engineering base for its AI ambitions, aiming to invest about $100 million in the country over the next five years. The investment is planned to expand its office in Gurugram and hire more staff in Bengaluru and Mumbai to build engineering, R&amp;amp;D, and customer success teams.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of its overall headcount of nearly 550 employees, Coralogix has about 250 people in Israel and 100 in India. It plans to double the Indian employee base over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we see just a really good fit between the Israeli engineering culture and Indian engineering culture, it’s a get-it-done, very independent, very committed to the mission type of engineering that we see a very good fit for us to expand into,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the questions don’t stop there.
