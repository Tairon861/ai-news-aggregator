&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of data management company Informatica last May.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with Salesforce as their poster child, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat business models obsolete. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really is not in the AI world.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself owning most of the tech stack, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) on the bottom as the unseen engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2221463618.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Salesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Reasoning large language models (LLMs) are designed to solve complex problems by breaking them down into a series of smaller steps. These powerful models are particularly good at challenging tasks like advanced programming and multistep planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But developing reasoning models demands an enormous amount of computation and energy due to inefficiencies in the training process. While a few of the high-power processors continuously work through complicated queries, others in the group sit idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT and elsewhere found a way to use this computational downtime to efficiently accelerate reasoning-model training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their new method automatically trains a smaller, faster model to predict the outputs of the larger reasoning LLM, which the larger model verifies. This reduces the amount of work the reasoning model must do, accelerating the training process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to this system is its ability to train and deploy the smaller model adaptively, so it kicks in only when some processors are idle. By leveraging computational resources that would otherwise have been wasted, it accelerates training without&amp;nbsp;incurring additional&amp;nbsp;overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tested on multiple reasoning LLMs, the method doubled the training speed while preserving accuracy. This could reduce the cost and increase the energy efficiency of developing advanced LLMs for applications such as forecasting financial trends or detecting risks in power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want models that can handle more complex tasks. But if that is the goal of model development, then we need to prioritize efficiency. We found a lossless solution to this problem and then developed a full-stack system that can deliver quite dramatic speedups in practice,” says Qinghao Hu, an MIT postdoc and co-lead author of a paper on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the paper by co-lead author Shang Yang, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student; Junxian Guo, an EECS graduate student; senior author Song Han, an associate professor in EECS, member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics and a distinguished scientist of NVIDIA; as well as others at NVIDIA, ETH Zurich, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The research will be presented at the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers want reasoning LLMs to identify and correct mistakes in their critical thinking process. This capability allows them to ace complicated queries that would trip up a standard LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To teach them this skill, developers train reasoning LLMs using a technique called reinforcement learning (RL). The model generates multiple potential answers to a query, receives a reward for the best candidate, and is updated based on the top answer. These steps repeat thousands of times as the model learns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers found that the process of generating multiple answers, called rollout, can consume as much as 85 percent of the&amp;nbsp;execution time needed for RL training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Updating the model — which is the actual ‘training’ part — consumes very little time by comparison,” Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bottleneck occurs&amp;nbsp;in standard RL algorithms because all processors in the training group must finish their responses before they can move on to the next step. Because some processors might be working on very long responses, others that generated shorter responses wait for them to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to turn this idle time into speedup without any wasted costs,” Hu adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sought to use an existing technique, called speculative decoding, to speed things up. Speculative decoding involves training a smaller model called a drafter to rapidly guess the future outputs of the larger model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger model verifies the drafter’s guesses, and the responses it accepts are used for training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the larger model can verify all the drafter’s guesses at once, rather than generating each output sequentially, it accelerates the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An adaptive solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in speculative decoding, the drafter model is typically trained only once and remains static. This makes the technique infeasible for reinforcement learning, since the reasoning model is updated thousands of times during training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A static drafter would quickly become stale and useless after a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this problem, the researchers created a flexible system known as “Taming the Long Tail,” or TLT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first part of TLT is an adaptive drafter trainer, which uses free time on idle processors to train the drafter model on the fly, keeping it well-aligned with the target model without using extra computational resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second component, an adaptive rollout engine, manages speculative decoding to automatically select the optimal strategy for each new batch of inputs. This mechanism changes the speculative decoding configuration based on the training workload features, such as the number of inputs processed by the draft model and the number of inputs accepted by the target model during verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers designed the draft model to be lightweight so it can be trained quickly. TLT reuses some components of the reasoning model training process to train the drafter, leading to extra gains in acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as some processors finish their short queries and become idle, we immediately switch them to do draft model training using the same data they are using for the rollout process. The key mechanism is our adaptive speculative decoding — these gains wouldn’t be possible without it,” Hu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested TLT across multiple reasoning LLMs that were trained using real-world datasets. The system accelerated training between 70 and 210 percent while preserving the accuracy of each model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, the small drafter model could readily be&amp;nbsp;utilized for efficient deployment as a free byproduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to integrate TLT into more types of training and inference frameworks and find new reinforcement learning applications that could be accelerated using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As reasoning continues to become the major workload driving the demand for inference, Qinghao’s TLT is great work to cope with the computation bottleneck of training these reasoning models. I think this method will be very helpful in the context of efficient AI computing,” Han says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the MIT AI Hardware Program, the MIT Amazon Science Hub, Hyundai Motor Company, and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

To geologists, they are much, much more: crystal-filled time capsules with the power to reveal the state of the planet at the very moment they were forged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, NASA had been on a time capsule hunt like none other—one across Mars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its rovers have journeyed around a nightmarish ocher desert that, billions of years ago, was home to rivers, lakes, perhaps even seas and oceans. They’ve been seeking to answer a momentous question: Once upon a time, did microbial life wriggle across its surface?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in July 2024, after more than three years on the planet, the Perseverance rover came across a peculiar rocky outcrop. Instead of the usual crystals or layers of sediment, this one had spots. Two kinds, in fact: one that looked like poppy seeds, and another that resembled those on a leopard. It’s possible that run-of-the-mill chemical reactions could have cooked up these odd features. But on Earth, these marks are almost always produced by microbial life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put it plainly: Holy crap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, those specks are not definitive proof of alien life. But they are the best hint yet that life may not be a one-off event in the cosmos. And they meant the most existential question of all—&lt;em&gt;Are we alone&lt;/em&gt;?—might soon be addressed. “If you do it, then human history is never the same,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that promotes planetary exploration and defense and the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the only way to confirm whether these seeds and spots are the fossilized imprint of alien biology is to bring a sample of that rock home to study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perseverance was the first stage of an ambitious scheme to do just that—in effect, to pull off a space heist. The mission—called Mars Sample Return and planned by the US, along with its European partners—would send a Rube Goldberg–like series of robotic missions to the planet to capture pristine rocks. The rover’s job was to find the most promising stones and extract samples; then it would pass them to another robot—the getaway driver—to take them off Mars and deliver them to Earth.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But now, just over a year and a half later, the project is on life support, with zero funding flowing in 2026 and little backing left in Congress. As a result, those oh-so-promising rocks may be stuck out there forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve spent 50 years preparing to get these samples back. We’re ready to do that,” says Philip Christensen, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University who works closely with NASA. “Now we’re two feet from the finish line—&lt;em&gt;Oh, sorry, we’re not going to complete the job&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also means that, in the race to find evidence of alien life, America has effectively ceded its pole position to its greatest geopolitical rival: China. The superpower is moving full steam ahead with its own version of MSR. It’s leaner than America and Europe’s mission, and the rock samples it will snatch from Mars will likely not be as high quality. But that won’t be the headline people remember—the one in the scientific journals and the history books. “At the rate we’re going, there’s a very good chance they’ll do it before we do,” laments Christensen. “Being there first is what matters.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, any finding of extraterrestrial life advances human knowledge writ large, no matter the identity of the discoverers. But there is the not-so-small issue of pride in an already heated nationalistic competition, not to mention the fact that many scientists in America (to say nothing of US lawmakers) don’t necessarily want their future research and scientific progress subject to a foreign gatekeeper. And even for those not especially concerned about potentially unearthing alien microbes, MSR and the comparable Chinese mission are technological stepping stones toward a long-held dream shared by many beyond Elon Musk: getting astronauts onto the Red Planet and, eventually, setting up long-term bases for astronauts there. It’d be a huge blow to show up only after a competitor had already set up shop … or not to get there at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we can’t do this, how do we think we’re gonna send humans there and get back safely?” says Victoria Hamilton, a planetary geologist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who is also the chair of the NASA-affiliated Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or as Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist from the Washington University in St. Louis, puts it: “If you’re going to bring humans back from Mars, you sure as shit have to figure out how to bring the samples back first.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly a dozen project insiders and scientists in both the US and China shared with me the story of how America blew its lead in the new space race. It’s full of wild dreams and promising discoveries—as well as mismanagement, eye-watering costs, and, ultimately, anger and disappointment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I spent most of my career studying Mars,” says Christensen. There are countless things about it that bewitch him. But by examining it, he suspects, we’ll get further than ever in the Homeric investigation of how life began.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, the Mars of today is a postapocalyptic wasteland, an arid and cold desert bathed in lethal radiation. But billions of years ago, water lapped up against the slopes of fiery volcanoes that erupted under a clement sky. Then its geologic interior cooled down so quickly, changing everything. Its global magnetic field collapsed like a deflating balloon, and its protective atmosphere was stripped away by the sun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133607" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-57337107.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NASA first touched down on Mars in 1976 with two Viking landers. The Mars Odyssey spacecraft has been orbiting the planet since 2001 and produced this image of Valles Marineris, which is 10 times longer, 5 times deeper, and 20 times wider than the Grand Canyon. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its surface is now remarkably hostile to life as we know it. But deep below ground, where it’s shielded from space, and where it’s warmer and wetter, there could maybe be microbes inching about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have long possessed several Martian meteorites that have been flung our way, but none of them are pristine; they were all damaged by cosmic radiation midflight, before getting scorched in Earth’s atmosphere. Plus, there’s another problem: “We currently have no rocks from Mars that are sedimentary, the rock type likely to contain fossils,” says Sara Russell, a planetary scientist at London’s Natural History Museum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For those, humans (or robots) would need to get on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NASA first made the stuff of sci-fi films a reality 50 years ago, when two Viking landers touched down on the planet in 1976. One of their experiments dropped some radioactively tagged nutrients into soil samples, the idea being that if any microbes were present, they’d gobble up the nutrients and burp out some radioactive waste gas that the landers could detect. Tantalizingly, this experiment hinted that something microbe-like was interacting with those nutrients—but the result was inconclusive (and today most scientists don’t suspect biology was responsible).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it was enough to elevate scientists’ curiosity about the genuine possibility of Martian life. Over the coming decades, America sent an ever-expanding fleet of robots to Mars—orbiting spacecraft, landers, and wheeled rovers. But no matter how hard they studied their adoptive planet’s rocks, they weren’t designed to &lt;em&gt;definitively&lt;/em&gt; detect signs of life. For that, promising-looking rocks would need to be captured and, somehow, shuttled back to labs on Earth in carefully sealed containers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133610" height="1667" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PIA25857orig.jpg?w=3000" width="3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A 2023 plan from NASA and the European Space Agency to safely transport pristine samples received from Mars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This became a top priority for the US planetary science community in 2003, following the publication of the first Planetary Decadal Survey, a census conducted at NASA’s request. The scientific case for the mission was clear—even to the people who &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; think they’d find signs of life. “I bet there isn’t life on Mars. But if there is, or was, that would be an incredibly important discovery,” says Christensen. And if not, “Why not?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds: “We may understand more about why life started on Earth by understanding why it may not have started on Mars. What was that key difference between those two planets?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so, MSR was born. America went all in, and the European Space Agency joined the team. Over the next decade or so, a complex plan was drawn up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, a NASA rover would land on Mars in a spot that once was potentially habitable—later determined to be Jezero Crater. It would zip about, look for layered rocks of the sort that you’d find in lakes and riverbeds, extract cores of them, and cache them in sealed containers. Then a second NASA spacecraft would land on Mars, receive the rover’s sample tubes (in one of several different ways), and transfer the samples to a rocket that would launch them into Martian orbit. A European-provided orbiter would catch that rocket like a baseball glove before returning home and dropping the rocks into Earth’s atmosphere, where they would be guided, via parachute, to eagerly awaiting scientists no later than the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133612" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP21054854805249.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Two messages were encoded on the 70-foot parachute used by the Perseverance rover as it descended toward Mars. This annotated image shows how NASA systems engineer Ian Clark used a binary code to spell out “Dare Mighty Things” in the orange and white strips; he also included the GPS coordinates for the mission’s headquarters at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Put simply, this is the most scientifically careful sample collection mission possible, conducted in one of the most promising places on Mars to look for signs of past life,” says Jonathan Lunine, the chief scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. “And, of course, should evidence of life be found in the sediments, that would be an historic discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It got off to an auspicious start. On July 30, 2020, in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic, NASA’s Perseverance rover launched atop a rocket from Florida’s Cape Canaveral. The NASA administrator at the time, Jim Bridenstine, didn’t mince words: “We are in extraordinary times right now,” he told reporters, “yet we have in fact persevered, and we have protected this mission because it is so important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But just earlier that same month, the mission to Mars had turned into a &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt;. China was now prepping its own sample return spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s when things for MSR started to unravel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133682" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image2_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;XINMEI LIU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China was comparatively late to develop a competitive space program, but once it began doing so, it wasted no time. In 2003, it first sent one of its astronauts into space, via its own bespoke rocket; in the two decades since, it has launched its own space station and sent multiple uncrewed spacecraft to the moon—first orbiters, then landers—as part of its Chang’e Project, named after a lunar goddess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a real turning point for China’s interplanetary ambitions came in 2020, the same year as Perseverance’s launch to Mars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That December, Chang’e-5 touched down in the moon’s Ocean of Storms, a realm of frozen lava 1,600 miles long. It grabbed some 2-billion-year-old rocks, put them in a rocket, and blasted them into the firmament. The samples were captured by a small orbiting spacecraft; crucially, the idea was not all that dissimilar from how MSR imagined catching its own samples, baseball-glove style. China’s lunar haul was then dropped off back on Earth just before Christmas. It marked the first time since 1976 that samples had been returned from the moon, and the mission was seamless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="two labelled vials of soil next to a small ruler for scale" class="wp-image-1133692" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Change-5_soil_samples.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China brought back soil samples from the moon’s Ocean of Storms during its Chang’e-5 mission, marking the first time since 1976 that samples had been returned from the moon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same year, China made its first foray toward Mars. The project was called Tianwen-1, meaning “Questions to Heaven”—the first in a new series of audacious space missions to the Red Planet and orbiting asteroids. While its success was far from guaranteed, China was willing to kick into high gear immediately,&amp;nbsp;sending both an orbiting spacecraft and a rover to Mars at the same time. No other country had ever managed to perform this act of spaceflight acrobatics on its first try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just as China ramped up its space schemes, some people in the scientific community began to wonder if NASA was (inadvertently) promising too much with MSR—and whether the heist would be worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the price tag for the program had jumped from an already expensive $5.3 billion to an estimated $7 billion. (For context, NASA’s Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission, which is currently being pieced together, has a price tag of around $1.2 billion. This space observatory is designed to find Earthbound asteroids and is tasked with defending all 8 billion of us from a catastrophic impact.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Perseverance was already on its way to Mars. It wasn’t as if this expensive train could go back to the station. The project’s advocates just hoped it’d actually make it there in one piece.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the US had previously entered Martian orbit successfully, several other entry, descent, and landing attempts on the planet had ended in explosive disaster; the primary antagonist is the Martian atmosphere, which can cause spacecraft to tumble wildly out of control or heat up and ignite. Perseverance would be traveling at nearly 12,500 miles per hour as it entered Mars’s airspace, and to land it’d need to decelerate, deploy a parachute, fire several rockets, and pilot itself to the skies above Jezero Crater—before a levitating crane would drop off the actual rover.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Perseverance’s deployment went off without a hitch. On February 18, 2021, Mars became its new home—and the rover’s makers hugged, high-fived, and whooped for joy in NASA’s flight control room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Lori Glaze, then director of&amp;nbsp;NASA’s planetary science division,&amp;nbsp;said at the time, “Now the fun really starts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133603" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NHQ202102180066orig.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Members of NASA’s Perseverance rover team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, celebrate after receiving confirmation that the spacecraft successfully touched down on Mars in February 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/BILL INGALLS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That very same month, China arrived at Mars’s doorstep for the first time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 10, 2021, Tianwen-1 began to orbit the planet. Then, on May 14, it slipped a drop shipment through the spacecraft-frying atmosphere to deliver a rover onto an expansive landscape called Utopia Planitia—giving Perseverance a neighbor, albeit one 1,200 miles away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This explorer was nowhere near as sophisticated as Perseverance, and its assignment was a far cry from a sample return mission. It had some cameras and scientific instruments for studying its environment, making it comparable to one of NASA’s older rovers. It was also supposed to operate for just three months (though it ended up persisting for an entire year before being fatally smothered by pernicious Martian dust).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Tianwen-1 was a remarkable achievement for China, one that the US couldn’t help but applaud. “This is a really big deal,” said Roger Launius, then NASA’s chief historian.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And even if grabbing pieces of Mars was increasingly likely in China’s future, it was &lt;em&gt;already happening&lt;/em&gt; in the present for the US. The race, the Americans thought, was over before it had even begun … right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, Perseverance went on an extraterrestrial joyride. It meandered through frozen flows of lava and journeyed over fans of sediment once washed about by copious liquid water. It pulled out rocks that preserved salty, muddy layers—exactly the environment that, on Earth, would be teeming with microorganisms and organic matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Jezero Crater clearly meets the astrobiological criterion for a sampling site where life may once have existed,” says Lunine from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. “Rocks of broadly similar age and setting on Earth contain some of the earliest evidence for life on our own planet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133618" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP21250588944004.jpg?w=1458" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Perseverance rover has been on an extraterrestrial joyride since 2021, drilling holes in promising looking space rocks that it hopes could be teeming with microorganisms and organic matter. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in September 2023, as Perseverance was trundling across the ruins of what may once have been a microbial metropolis, an independent panel of researchers published a report that made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that MSR was the opposite of okay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They found that the project was too decentralized among the nation’s plethora of NASA centers, leaving confusion as to who was actually in charge. And at its current pace, MSR wouldn’t get its Mars rocks back home until the 2040s at the earliest—as much as a whole decade later than initial estimates. And it would cost as much as $11 billion, more than doubling the initial tab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“MSR was established with unrealistic budget and schedule expectations from the beginning,” the report reads. “MSR was also organized under an unwieldy structure. As a result, there is currently no credible, congruent technical, nor properly margined schedule, cost, and technical baseline that can be accomplished with the likely available funding.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of Congress started to wonder aloud whether MSR should be canceled outright, and the scientific community that had once so enthusiastically supported the mission faced a moment of reckoning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Byrne, the planetary scientist from the Washington University in St. Louis, had always been something of a rebel, never really a fan of NASA’s multi-decadal, over-the-top fascination with Mars. The solar system, he argued, is filled with curious worlds to explore—especially Venus, another nearby rocky world that was once rather Earth-like. Couldn’t we spare some of NASA’s budget to make sure we explore Venus, too?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, like many other critical colleagues, Byrne did not want to see MSR put down. The report’s findings didn’t change the fact that Perseverance was dutifully working around the clock to accomplish the mission’s opening stages. What would be the point of gathering all those samples if they were going to be left to stay on Mars? The community, Byrne explains, just needed to answer one question: “How do you do this in a way that’s faster and cheaper?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, NASA publicly sought help from its industry partners in the space sector: Could anyone come up with a way to save MSR? Various players with spaceflight experience, like Lockheed Martin, sent in proposals for consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, just a few months later in July 2024, Perseverance came in clutch, finding those special leopard-spotted and speckled rocks in an old river valley—a sign of hope that NASA had been desperately seeking. Now the agency’s request for help was all the more urgent—these rocks had to get home. After various panels assessed plans that could effectively save MSR, two potential options for a faster, leaner, less expensive version were previewed at a January 2025 press briefing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One option brought in tried-and-tested tech: Since Perseverance had been safely deployed onto the surface of Mars using a hovering platform known as a sky crane, it was proposed that the sample-gathering lander for MSR could also be dropped off using a sky crane, which would simplify this step and reduce the overall cost of the program. The other suggestion was that the lander could be delivered to Mars via a spaceship from a commercial spaceflight company. The lander design itself could also be streamlined, and tweaks could be made to the rocket that would launch the samples back into space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proposals needed greater study, but everyone’s spirits were lifted by the fact these plans &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, at least theoretically, get samples back in the 2030s, not the 2040s. And, crucially, “it was possible to get the cost down,” says Jack Mustard, an Earth and planetary scientist at Brown University and a member of one of the two proposal-reviewing panels. Still, it didn’t save a lot: They could do MSR for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we came up with was very reasonable, rational, much simpler,” says Christensen, who was part of the same review panel. “And $8 billion is about the right amount it would take to guarantee that it’s going to work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133683" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image3_final.jpg?w=2500" width="2500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;XINMEI LIU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the US became increasingly consumed with its own interplanetary woes, China was riding high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the sixth installment in the Chang’e project made history. It was another lunar sample return mission, but this one did something nobody had ever done in the history of spaceflight: It landed on the difficult-to-reach, out-of-view far side of the moon and snagged samples from it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China made it look effortless when a capsule containing matter from this previously untouched region safely landed in Inner Mongolia. Long Xiao, a planetary geoscientist at the China University of Geosciences, told reporters at the time that the mission’s success was “a cause for celebration for all humanity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it was also effectively a bombshell for NASA. Yes, the moon is much closer to Earth, and it doesn’t have a spaceship-destroying atmosphere like Mars. But China was speedrunning through the race while America was largely looking the other way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in May 2025, China launched Tianwen-2. Its destination was not Mars but a near-Earth asteroid. The plan is that it will scoop up some of the space rock’s primordial pebbles later this year and deliver them back to Earth in late 2027. In light of China’s past successes, many suspect it’ll nail this project, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tianwen-2 on the launchpad" class="wp-image-1133598" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25149225181672.jpg?w=2923" width="2923" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China’s Tianwen missions, meaning “Questions to Heaven,” aim to explore both Mars and orbiting asteroids. The Tianwen-2 probe blasted off in May 2025, headed toward a near-Earth asteroid for a sample-return mission.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VCG/VCG VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But perhaps the biggest blow to the US came in June 2025: China revealed its formal designs on returning samples from Mars—and potentially addressing the existence of life elsewhere in the cosmos. Chinese researchers outlined a bold plan for Tianwen-3 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. “Searching for signs of life, or astrobiology studies, are the first priority,” says Yuqi Qian, a lunar geologist at the University of Hong Kong. And while many observers had long been cognizant of this ambition, seeing it so clearly spelled out in academic writing made it &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The selection of the landing site is still ongoing,” says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Li Yiliang, an astrobiologist at the University of Hong Kong, an author of the Tianwen-3 study, and a member of the spacecraft’s landing site selection team. But the paper notes, in no uncertain terms, that the mission will move at a breakneck pace. “The aim of China’s Mars sample return mission, known as Tianwen-3, is to collect at least 500g of samples from Mars and return them to Earth around 2031.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2031&lt;/em&gt;. Even on its original, speedier timeline, America’s MSR plan wouldn’t get samples back by that date. So how is China planning to pull it off?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qian explains that Tianwen-3 is building on the success of the lunar sample return program. Doing something similar for Mars is a rather giant technological leap (requiring two rockets, not one)—but, he argues, “the technologies here are similar.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plan is for a duet of rockets to blast off from Earth in 2028. The first will contain the lander-ascender combination, or LAC. The second is the orbiter-returner combination, or ORC. The LAC will get to Mars and deploy a lander as well as a small helicopter, which will scout promising locations around the landing site while using a claw to bring several small samples back to the lander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133599" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Zhurong-with-lander-selfie.png?w=1818" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China’s Tianwen-3 mission is searching for signs of Martian life with an eye toward having samples back home sometime in 2031.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;中国新闻社 VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The LAC will then travel to the most promising site. The lander’s drill, which can get down to around seven feet below the surface, is the most important part of the mission. At that depth, there are greater odds of capturing signs of past life. When at least 500 grams of pristine rocks have been loaded aboard the lander, the samples will be launched into space, where the orbiter will be waiting to capture them and send them back home sometime in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The returned samples will be quarantined strictly in an under-planning facility near Hefei city,” says Yiliang. And there, in those bio-secure labs, scientists might very well find the first clear signs of alien life, past or present.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The very same month that Chinese researchers published their daring plans for returning Mars samples, the new Trump administration released a draconian NASA budget for Congress to consider—one that sparked panic across the planetary science community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If enacted, it would have been a historic catastrophe for the venerable space agency, giving NASA its smallest budget since 1961. This would have forced it to let go of a huge number of staffers, slash its science program budget in half, and terminate 19 missions currently in operation. MSR was in the crosshairs, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Grim is the word,” says Dreier of the Planetary Society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, Congress pushed back on the potential gutting of NASA, but largely to save ongoing solar system exploration missions. MSR was not considered an active effort; Perseverance was effectively a scientific scout acting independently by this point. A counterproposal by the House offered up $300 million for MSR, but no policymaker was cheerleading for it. (The US Office of Management and Budget, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and the office of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mars Sample Return doesn’t seem to have very many advocates right now,” says Byrne. The project “isn’t featuring in anyone’s conversation at the moment, with all of the existential shit that’s happening to NASA.” Everyone working on a NASA mission hoped that they, and their spacecraft, would survive the onslaught. As Byrne adds: “[People are] just trying to keep their heads down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_38"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in America suddenly found themselves at an inflection point. “The attack on science, and the attack on NASA science, has been very successful, in that it has completely demoralized the science community,” says Christensen. “Everyone’s in a state of shock.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I contacted NASA in July about the state of MSR, which was then in the middle of a months-long limbo, I was told that experts weren’t available to comment. Roxana Bardan, a spokesperson, instead sent a statement: “Under President Trump’s America First agenda, NASA is committed to sustained U.S. space leadership. We will continue to innovate, explore, and excel to ensure American preeminence in space.” (The agency did not respond to a follow-up request for comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That notion stood in direct contrast to what Christensen told me around the same time.&amp;nbsp;“The US … has led the exploration of Mars for 50 years,” he said. “And as we approach one of the key discovery points, we’re about to concede that leadership to someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From China’s perspective, the fumbling of MSR is more confusing than anything else. “NASA has so well prepared for her MSR mission in both technology and science, and I and my colleagues have learned so much from NASA’s scientific communities,” says Yiliang.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if China wins the race because America decided to shoot itself in the foot? “This is sad,” he says. “If this comes true, I believe the Chinese will not be that happy to win the race in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tianwen-3 will still have to overcome many of the same hurdles as MSR. Nobody, for example, has autonomously launched a rocket of any kind off the surface of Mars. But many believe the Chinese can succeed, even at their program’s superspeed. Christensen, for one, fully expected several of their past robotic missions to the moon and Mars to fail—but “the fact that they pulled it off the first time really says a lot about their engineering capability,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mustard agrees: “They know how to land; they know how to leave. I have a lot of confidence that they’ve learned enough from the lunar work that they’ll be able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_40"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, Tianwen-3’s architecture is simpler than the US-European mission. It has fewer components, and fewer points of potential failure. This also means, though, that the quality of the loot will be somewhat lacking. Tianwen-3 will sample from only one small patch of Mars. Conversely, Perseverance is roving around a vast and geologically diverse landscape, sampling as it goes, which would translate to “literally orders of magnitude more science than what will come from the Chinese samples,” says Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But China could serendipitously land on a biologically rich patch of the planet. As the Southwest Research Institute’s Hamilton says, the mission could “pick up something entirely unexpected and, you know, miraculous.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_42"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The likeliest outcome is still that neither nation finds fossilized microbes, but that China brings back rocks from Mars first. At the end of the day, that’s what Americans (and Europeans) will hear: “You’re second. You lost,” says Mustard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage"&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage__imageWrapper--713fbd99308fe950febff06b694edeaa is-style-full-bleed"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 39.3749rem)" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image4_final.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage__credit--d43dc7ec3d50859db7eb8d2def69081a image-credit"&gt;Xinmei Liu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_44"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many of his colleagues, Christensen is irked by the thought of losing the race to Mars, because it would be such an own goal. The US has been sending robots over there for decades and investing billions in forging the technology that would be required to make MSR a success. And suddenly “the Chinese come along and say, &lt;em&gt;Thank you very much, we’ll take all of that information—we’ll build one mission and go and do what you guys did the groundwork for&lt;/em&gt;,” Christensen says. “As a taxpayer, I’m like: It just seems foolish to me.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the MSR skeptics concede that this kind of loss would have sweeping ramifications. Byrne worries that if something like MSR can be snuffed out so easily, what’s to say the next big mission—to Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond—won’t suffer the same ignoble fate? In other words, the death of MSR would severely damage “the ability of the planetary community to dream big,” he says. “If we don’t pull this off, what does that mean? Are we not going to do big, expensive, difficult things?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another big, expensive, difficult thing? Putting humans on Mars. Both critics and advocates of MSR largely agree it is an invaluable dress rehearsal. Making sure you can safely launch a rocket off Mars is a necessary prerequisite to ensuring that an array of equipment can survive for a long time on the planet’s lethal surface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China, too, has explicitly acknowledged this. As one of the first lines of the Tianwen-3 study states, “Mars is the most promising planet for humanity’s expansion beyond Earth, with its potential for future habitability and accessible resources.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though such expansion is still of course a far-future dream, it’s not hard to see how losing the race here would put the US at a huge disadvantage. Members of America’s planetary science community say that to try to sway politicians in their favor, they have framed MSR as a national security issue. But they haven’t had much luck. “We’ve been in discussions with decision-makers who have never heard that perspective before,” says the Planetary Society’s Dreier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_46"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is surprising that doesn’t have more weight,” adds Mustard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite months of purgatory, it still stung when the coup de grâce arrived in January. In the draft for a must-pass spending bill, House and Senate appropriators spared NASA from the harshest proposed cuts, thereby saving dozens of spaceflight missions and preserving much of the agency’s planetary science output. But the bill provided absolutely zero political or financial support for MSR. There it was, in black and white: America’s plans to perform a history-making heist on Mars were dead. The bill became law in January and Perseverance, it seems, is now destined to rove alone on the Red Planet until its nuclear battery burns out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This austere reality clashes with the soaring aspirations outlined in the first Planetary Decadal Survey, written just over two decades ago. It stated that the US exploration of the solar system “has a proud past, a productive present, and an auspicious future.” It also noted that “answers to profound questions about our origins and our future may be within our grasp.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now the answers have all but slipped away. Even though Perseverance continues to roam, it’s increasingly likely we’ll never see those promising bespeckled rocks with human eyes, let alone any other rocks the rover finds intriguing. It is far easier to imagine that in the near future, perhaps in the early 2030s, Perseverance will point its camera up at the night sky above Jezero Crater. It will catch a small glimmer: Tianwen-3’s orbiter, preparing to send ancient rocks back to Earth. Meanwhile, Perseverance’s own sample tubes—perhaps some containing signs of life—will be trapped on the Martian surface, gathering dust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133605" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PIA25738orig.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sample tubes collected by the Perseverance rover may never make it home from the Martian surface.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH/MSSS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a sobering thought for Christensen. “We’ll wake up one day and go: What the hell?” he says. “How did we let this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

To geologists, they are much, much more: crystal-filled time capsules with the power to reveal the state of the planet at the very moment they were forged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For decades, NASA had been on a time capsule hunt like none other—one across Mars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its rovers have journeyed around a nightmarish ocher desert that, billions of years ago, was home to rivers, lakes, perhaps even seas and oceans. They’ve been seeking to answer a momentous question: Once upon a time, did microbial life wriggle across its surface?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in July 2024, after more than three years on the planet, the Perseverance rover came across a peculiar rocky outcrop. Instead of the usual crystals or layers of sediment, this one had spots. Two kinds, in fact: one that looked like poppy seeds, and another that resembled those on a leopard. It’s possible that run-of-the-mill chemical reactions could have cooked up these odd features. But on Earth, these marks are almost always produced by microbial life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put it plainly: Holy crap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, those specks are not definitive proof of alien life. But they are the best hint yet that life may not be a one-off event in the cosmos. And they meant the most existential question of all—&lt;em&gt;Are we alone&lt;/em&gt;?—might soon be addressed. “If you do it, then human history is never the same,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that promotes planetary exploration and defense and the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the only way to confirm whether these seeds and spots are the fossilized imprint of alien biology is to bring a sample of that rock home to study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perseverance was the first stage of an ambitious scheme to do just that—in effect, to pull off a space heist. The mission—called Mars Sample Return and planned by the US, along with its European partners—would send a Rube Goldberg–like series of robotic missions to the planet to capture pristine rocks. The rover’s job was to find the most promising stones and extract samples; then it would pass them to another robot—the getaway driver—to take them off Mars and deliver them to Earth.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But now, just over a year and a half later, the project is on life support, with zero funding flowing in 2026 and little backing left in Congress. As a result, those oh-so-promising rocks may be stuck out there forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve spent 50 years preparing to get these samples back. We’re ready to do that,” says Philip Christensen, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University who works closely with NASA. “Now we’re two feet from the finish line—&lt;em&gt;Oh, sorry, we’re not going to complete the job&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also means that, in the race to find evidence of alien life, America has effectively ceded its pole position to its greatest geopolitical rival: China. The superpower is moving full steam ahead with its own version of MSR. It’s leaner than America and Europe’s mission, and the rock samples it will snatch from Mars will likely not be as high quality. But that won’t be the headline people remember—the one in the scientific journals and the history books. “At the rate we’re going, there’s a very good chance they’ll do it before we do,” laments Christensen. “Being there first is what matters.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, any finding of extraterrestrial life advances human knowledge writ large, no matter the identity of the discoverers. But there is the not-so-small issue of pride in an already heated nationalistic competition, not to mention the fact that many scientists in America (to say nothing of US lawmakers) don’t necessarily want their future research and scientific progress subject to a foreign gatekeeper. And even for those not especially concerned about potentially unearthing alien microbes, MSR and the comparable Chinese mission are technological stepping stones toward a long-held dream shared by many beyond Elon Musk: getting astronauts onto the Red Planet and, eventually, setting up long-term bases for astronauts there. It’d be a huge blow to show up only after a competitor had already set up shop … or not to get there at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we can’t do this, how do we think we’re gonna send humans there and get back safely?” says Victoria Hamilton, a planetary geologist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who is also the chair of the NASA-affiliated Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or as Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist from the Washington University in St. Louis, puts it: “If you’re going to bring humans back from Mars, you sure as shit have to figure out how to bring the samples back first.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly a dozen project insiders and scientists in both the US and China shared with me the story of how America blew its lead in the new space race. It’s full of wild dreams and promising discoveries—as well as mismanagement, eye-watering costs, and, ultimately, anger and disappointment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I spent most of my career studying Mars,” says Christensen. There are countless things about it that bewitch him. But by examining it, he suspects, we’ll get further than ever in the Homeric investigation of how life began.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, the Mars of today is a postapocalyptic wasteland, an arid and cold desert bathed in lethal radiation. But billions of years ago, water lapped up against the slopes of fiery volcanoes that erupted under a clement sky. Then its geologic interior cooled down so quickly, changing everything. Its global magnetic field collapsed like a deflating balloon, and its protective atmosphere was stripped away by the sun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133607" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-57337107.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NASA first touched down on Mars in 1976 with two Viking landers. The Mars Odyssey spacecraft has been orbiting the planet since 2001 and produced this image of Valles Marineris, which is 10 times longer, 5 times deeper, and 20 times wider than the Grand Canyon. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its surface is now remarkably hostile to life as we know it. But deep below ground, where it’s shielded from space, and where it’s warmer and wetter, there could maybe be microbes inching about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have long possessed several Martian meteorites that have been flung our way, but none of them are pristine; they were all damaged by cosmic radiation midflight, before getting scorched in Earth’s atmosphere. Plus, there’s another problem: “We currently have no rocks from Mars that are sedimentary, the rock type likely to contain fossils,” says Sara Russell, a planetary scientist at London’s Natural History Museum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For those, humans (or robots) would need to get on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NASA first made the stuff of sci-fi films a reality 50 years ago, when two Viking landers touched down on the planet in 1976. One of their experiments dropped some radioactively tagged nutrients into soil samples, the idea being that if any microbes were present, they’d gobble up the nutrients and burp out some radioactive waste gas that the landers could detect. Tantalizingly, this experiment hinted that something microbe-like was interacting with those nutrients—but the result was inconclusive (and today most scientists don’t suspect biology was responsible).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it was enough to elevate scientists’ curiosity about the genuine possibility of Martian life. Over the coming decades, America sent an ever-expanding fleet of robots to Mars—orbiting spacecraft, landers, and wheeled rovers. But no matter how hard they studied their adoptive planet’s rocks, they weren’t designed to &lt;em&gt;definitively&lt;/em&gt; detect signs of life. For that, promising-looking rocks would need to be captured and, somehow, shuttled back to labs on Earth in carefully sealed containers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133610" height="1667" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PIA25857orig.jpg?w=3000" width="3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A 2023 plan from NASA and the European Space Agency to safely transport pristine samples received from Mars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This became a top priority for the US planetary science community in 2003, following the publication of the first Planetary Decadal Survey, a census conducted at NASA’s request. The scientific case for the mission was clear—even to the people who &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; think they’d find signs of life. “I bet there isn’t life on Mars. But if there is, or was, that would be an incredibly important discovery,” says Christensen. And if not, “Why not?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds: “We may understand more about why life started on Earth by understanding why it may not have started on Mars. What was that key difference between those two planets?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so, MSR was born. America went all in, and the European Space Agency joined the team. Over the next decade or so, a complex plan was drawn up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, a NASA rover would land on Mars in a spot that once was potentially habitable—later determined to be Jezero Crater. It would zip about, look for layered rocks of the sort that you’d find in lakes and riverbeds, extract cores of them, and cache them in sealed containers. Then a second NASA spacecraft would land on Mars, receive the rover’s sample tubes (in one of several different ways), and transfer the samples to a rocket that would launch them into Martian orbit. A European-provided orbiter would catch that rocket like a baseball glove before returning home and dropping the rocks into Earth’s atmosphere, where they would be guided, via parachute, to eagerly awaiting scientists no later than the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133612" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP21054854805249.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Two messages were encoded on the 70-foot parachute used by the Perseverance rover as it descended toward Mars. This annotated image shows how NASA systems engineer Ian Clark used a binary code to spell out “Dare Mighty Things” in the orange and white strips; he also included the GPS coordinates for the mission’s headquarters at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Put simply, this is the most scientifically careful sample collection mission possible, conducted in one of the most promising places on Mars to look for signs of past life,” says Jonathan Lunine, the chief scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. “And, of course, should evidence of life be found in the sediments, that would be an historic discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It got off to an auspicious start. On July 30, 2020, in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic, NASA’s Perseverance rover launched atop a rocket from Florida’s Cape Canaveral. The NASA administrator at the time, Jim Bridenstine, didn’t mince words: “We are in extraordinary times right now,” he told reporters, “yet we have in fact persevered, and we have protected this mission because it is so important.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But just earlier that same month, the mission to Mars had turned into a &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt;. China was now prepping its own sample return spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s when things for MSR started to unravel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133682" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image2_final.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;XINMEI LIU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China was comparatively late to develop a competitive space program, but once it began doing so, it wasted no time. In 2003, it first sent one of its astronauts into space, via its own bespoke rocket; in the two decades since, it has launched its own space station and sent multiple uncrewed spacecraft to the moon—first orbiters, then landers—as part of its Chang’e Project, named after a lunar goddess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a real turning point for China’s interplanetary ambitions came in 2020, the same year as Perseverance’s launch to Mars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That December, Chang’e-5 touched down in the moon’s Ocean of Storms, a realm of frozen lava 1,600 miles long. It grabbed some 2-billion-year-old rocks, put them in a rocket, and blasted them into the firmament. The samples were captured by a small orbiting spacecraft; crucially, the idea was not all that dissimilar from how MSR imagined catching its own samples, baseball-glove style. China’s lunar haul was then dropped off back on Earth just before Christmas. It marked the first time since 1976 that samples had been returned from the moon, and the mission was seamless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="two labelled vials of soil next to a small ruler for scale" class="wp-image-1133692" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Change-5_soil_samples.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China brought back soil samples from the moon’s Ocean of Storms during its Chang’e-5 mission, marking the first time since 1976 that samples had been returned from the moon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same year, China made its first foray toward Mars. The project was called Tianwen-1, meaning “Questions to Heaven”—the first in a new series of audacious space missions to the Red Planet and orbiting asteroids. While its success was far from guaranteed, China was willing to kick into high gear immediately,&amp;nbsp;sending both an orbiting spacecraft and a rover to Mars at the same time. No other country had ever managed to perform this act of spaceflight acrobatics on its first try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just as China ramped up its space schemes, some people in the scientific community began to wonder if NASA was (inadvertently) promising too much with MSR—and whether the heist would be worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the price tag for the program had jumped from an already expensive $5.3 billion to an estimated $7 billion. (For context, NASA’s Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission, which is currently being pieced together, has a price tag of around $1.2 billion. This space observatory is designed to find Earthbound asteroids and is tasked with defending all 8 billion of us from a catastrophic impact.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Perseverance was already on its way to Mars. It wasn’t as if this expensive train could go back to the station. The project’s advocates just hoped it’d actually make it there in one piece.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the US had previously entered Martian orbit successfully, several other entry, descent, and landing attempts on the planet had ended in explosive disaster; the primary antagonist is the Martian atmosphere, which can cause spacecraft to tumble wildly out of control or heat up and ignite. Perseverance would be traveling at nearly 12,500 miles per hour as it entered Mars’s airspace, and to land it’d need to decelerate, deploy a parachute, fire several rockets, and pilot itself to the skies above Jezero Crater—before a levitating crane would drop off the actual rover.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Perseverance’s deployment went off without a hitch. On February 18, 2021, Mars became its new home—and the rover’s makers hugged, high-fived, and whooped for joy in NASA’s flight control room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Lori Glaze, then director of&amp;nbsp;NASA’s planetary science division,&amp;nbsp;said at the time, “Now the fun really starts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133603" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NHQ202102180066orig.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Members of NASA’s Perseverance rover team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, celebrate after receiving confirmation that the spacecraft successfully touched down on Mars in February 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/BILL INGALLS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That very same month, China arrived at Mars’s doorstep for the first time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On February 10, 2021, Tianwen-1 began to orbit the planet. Then, on May 14, it slipped a drop shipment through the spacecraft-frying atmosphere to deliver a rover onto an expansive landscape called Utopia Planitia—giving Perseverance a neighbor, albeit one 1,200 miles away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This explorer was nowhere near as sophisticated as Perseverance, and its assignment was a far cry from a sample return mission. It had some cameras and scientific instruments for studying its environment, making it comparable to one of NASA’s older rovers. It was also supposed to operate for just three months (though it ended up persisting for an entire year before being fatally smothered by pernicious Martian dust).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Tianwen-1 was a remarkable achievement for China, one that the US couldn’t help but applaud. “This is a really big deal,” said Roger Launius, then NASA’s chief historian.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And even if grabbing pieces of Mars was increasingly likely in China’s future, it was &lt;em&gt;already happening&lt;/em&gt; in the present for the US. The race, the Americans thought, was over before it had even begun … right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, Perseverance went on an extraterrestrial joyride. It meandered through frozen flows of lava and journeyed over fans of sediment once washed about by copious liquid water. It pulled out rocks that preserved salty, muddy layers—exactly the environment that, on Earth, would be teeming with microorganisms and organic matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Jezero Crater clearly meets the astrobiological criterion for a sampling site where life may once have existed,” says Lunine from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. “Rocks of broadly similar age and setting on Earth contain some of the earliest evidence for life on our own planet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133618" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP21250588944004.jpg?w=1458" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Perseverance rover has been on an extraterrestrial joyride since 2021, drilling holes in promising looking space rocks that it hopes could be teeming with microorganisms and organic matter. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in September 2023, as Perseverance was trundling across the ruins of what may once have been a microbial metropolis, an independent panel of researchers published a report that made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that MSR was the opposite of okay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They found that the project was too decentralized among the nation’s plethora of NASA centers, leaving confusion as to who was actually in charge. And at its current pace, MSR wouldn’t get its Mars rocks back home until the 2040s at the earliest—as much as a whole decade later than initial estimates. And it would cost as much as $11 billion, more than doubling the initial tab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“MSR was established with unrealistic budget and schedule expectations from the beginning,” the report reads. “MSR was also organized under an unwieldy structure. As a result, there is currently no credible, congruent technical, nor properly margined schedule, cost, and technical baseline that can be accomplished with the likely available funding.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of Congress started to wonder aloud whether MSR should be canceled outright, and the scientific community that had once so enthusiastically supported the mission faced a moment of reckoning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Byrne, the planetary scientist from the Washington University in St. Louis, had always been something of a rebel, never really a fan of NASA’s multi-decadal, over-the-top fascination with Mars. The solar system, he argued, is filled with curious worlds to explore—especially Venus, another nearby rocky world that was once rather Earth-like. Couldn’t we spare some of NASA’s budget to make sure we explore Venus, too?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, like many other critical colleagues, Byrne did not want to see MSR put down. The report’s findings didn’t change the fact that Perseverance was dutifully working around the clock to accomplish the mission’s opening stages. What would be the point of gathering all those samples if they were going to be left to stay on Mars? The community, Byrne explains, just needed to answer one question: “How do you do this in a way that’s faster and cheaper?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, NASA publicly sought help from its industry partners in the space sector: Could anyone come up with a way to save MSR? Various players with spaceflight experience, like Lockheed Martin, sent in proposals for consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, just a few months later in July 2024, Perseverance came in clutch, finding those special leopard-spotted and speckled rocks in an old river valley—a sign of hope that NASA had been desperately seeking. Now the agency’s request for help was all the more urgent—these rocks had to get home. After various panels assessed plans that could effectively save MSR, two potential options for a faster, leaner, less expensive version were previewed at a January 2025 press briefing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One option brought in tried-and-tested tech: Since Perseverance had been safely deployed onto the surface of Mars using a hovering platform known as a sky crane, it was proposed that the sample-gathering lander for MSR could also be dropped off using a sky crane, which would simplify this step and reduce the overall cost of the program. The other suggestion was that the lander could be delivered to Mars via a spaceship from a commercial spaceflight company. The lander design itself could also be streamlined, and tweaks could be made to the rocket that would launch the samples back into space.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proposals needed greater study, but everyone’s spirits were lifted by the fact these plans &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, at least theoretically, get samples back in the 2030s, not the 2040s. And, crucially, “it was possible to get the cost down,” says Jack Mustard, an Earth and planetary scientist at Brown University and a member of one of the two proposal-reviewing panels. Still, it didn’t save a lot: They could do MSR for $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we came up with was very reasonable, rational, much simpler,” says Christensen, who was part of the same review panel. “And $8 billion is about the right amount it would take to guarantee that it’s going to work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133683" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image3_final.jpg?w=2500" width="2500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;XINMEI LIU&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the US became increasingly consumed with its own interplanetary woes, China was riding high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the sixth installment in the Chang’e project made history. It was another lunar sample return mission, but this one did something nobody had ever done in the history of spaceflight: It landed on the difficult-to-reach, out-of-view far side of the moon and snagged samples from it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China made it look effortless when a capsule containing matter from this previously untouched region safely landed in Inner Mongolia. Long Xiao, a planetary geoscientist at the China University of Geosciences, told reporters at the time that the mission’s success was “a cause for celebration for all humanity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it was also effectively a bombshell for NASA. Yes, the moon is much closer to Earth, and it doesn’t have a spaceship-destroying atmosphere like Mars. But China was speedrunning through the race while America was largely looking the other way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in May 2025, China launched Tianwen-2. Its destination was not Mars but a near-Earth asteroid. The plan is that it will scoop up some of the space rock’s primordial pebbles later this year and deliver them back to Earth in late 2027. In light of China’s past successes, many suspect it’ll nail this project, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tianwen-2 on the launchpad" class="wp-image-1133598" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25149225181672.jpg?w=2923" width="2923" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China’s Tianwen missions, meaning “Questions to Heaven,” aim to explore both Mars and orbiting asteroids. The Tianwen-2 probe blasted off in May 2025, headed toward a near-Earth asteroid for a sample-return mission.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VCG/VCG VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But perhaps the biggest blow to the US came in June 2025: China revealed its formal designs on returning samples from Mars—and potentially addressing the existence of life elsewhere in the cosmos. Chinese researchers outlined a bold plan for Tianwen-3 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. “Searching for signs of life, or astrobiology studies, are the first priority,” says Yuqi Qian, a lunar geologist at the University of Hong Kong. And while many observers had long been cognizant of this ambition, seeing it so clearly spelled out in academic writing made it &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The selection of the landing site is still ongoing,” says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Li Yiliang, an astrobiologist at the University of Hong Kong, an author of the Tianwen-3 study, and a member of the spacecraft’s landing site selection team. But the paper notes, in no uncertain terms, that the mission will move at a breakneck pace. “The aim of China’s Mars sample return mission, known as Tianwen-3, is to collect at least 500g of samples from Mars and return them to Earth around 2031.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2031&lt;/em&gt;. Even on its original, speedier timeline, America’s MSR plan wouldn’t get samples back by that date. So how is China planning to pull it off?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qian explains that Tianwen-3 is building on the success of the lunar sample return program. Doing something similar for Mars is a rather giant technological leap (requiring two rockets, not one)—but, he argues, “the technologies here are similar.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plan is for a duet of rockets to blast off from Earth in 2028. The first will contain the lander-ascender combination, or LAC. The second is the orbiter-returner combination, or ORC. The LAC will get to Mars and deploy a lander as well as a small helicopter, which will scout promising locations around the landing site while using a claw to bring several small samples back to the lander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133599" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Zhurong-with-lander-selfie.png?w=1818" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;China’s Tianwen-3 mission is searching for signs of Martian life with an eye toward having samples back home sometime in 2031.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;中国新闻社 VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The LAC will then travel to the most promising site. The lander’s drill, which can get down to around seven feet below the surface, is the most important part of the mission. At that depth, there are greater odds of capturing signs of past life. When at least 500 grams of pristine rocks have been loaded aboard the lander, the samples will be launched into space, where the orbiter will be waiting to capture them and send them back home sometime in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The returned samples will be quarantined strictly in an under-planning facility near Hefei city,” says Yiliang. And there, in those bio-secure labs, scientists might very well find the first clear signs of alien life, past or present.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The very same month that Chinese researchers published their daring plans for returning Mars samples, the new Trump administration released a draconian NASA budget for Congress to consider—one that sparked panic across the planetary science community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If enacted, it would have been a historic catastrophe for the venerable space agency, giving NASA its smallest budget since 1961. This would have forced it to let go of a huge number of staffers, slash its science program budget in half, and terminate 19 missions currently in operation. MSR was in the crosshairs, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Grim is the word,” says Dreier of the Planetary Society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, Congress pushed back on the potential gutting of NASA, but largely to save ongoing solar system exploration missions. MSR was not considered an active effort; Perseverance was effectively a scientific scout acting independently by this point. A counterproposal by the House offered up $300 million for MSR, but no policymaker was cheerleading for it. (The US Office of Management and Budget, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and the office of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_36"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mars Sample Return doesn’t seem to have very many advocates right now,” says Byrne. The project “isn’t featuring in anyone’s conversation at the moment, with all of the existential shit that’s happening to NASA.” Everyone working on a NASA mission hoped that they, and their spacecraft, would survive the onslaught. As Byrne adds: “[People are] just trying to keep their heads down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_38"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in America suddenly found themselves at an inflection point. “The attack on science, and the attack on NASA science, has been very successful, in that it has completely demoralized the science community,” says Christensen. “Everyone’s in a state of shock.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I contacted NASA in July about the state of MSR, which was then in the middle of a months-long limbo, I was told that experts weren’t available to comment. Roxana Bardan, a spokesperson, instead sent a statement: “Under President Trump’s America First agenda, NASA is committed to sustained U.S. space leadership. We will continue to innovate, explore, and excel to ensure American preeminence in space.” (The agency did not respond to a follow-up request for comment.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That notion stood in direct contrast to what Christensen told me around the same time.&amp;nbsp;“The US … has led the exploration of Mars for 50 years,” he said. “And as we approach one of the key discovery points, we’re about to concede that leadership to someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From China’s perspective, the fumbling of MSR is more confusing than anything else. “NASA has so well prepared for her MSR mission in both technology and science, and I and my colleagues have learned so much from NASA’s scientific communities,” says Yiliang.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if China wins the race because America decided to shoot itself in the foot? “This is sad,” he says. “If this comes true, I believe the Chinese will not be that happy to win the race in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tianwen-3 will still have to overcome many of the same hurdles as MSR. Nobody, for example, has autonomously launched a rocket of any kind off the surface of Mars. But many believe the Chinese can succeed, even at their program’s superspeed. Christensen, for one, fully expected several of their past robotic missions to the moon and Mars to fail—but “the fact that they pulled it off the first time really says a lot about their engineering capability,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mustard agrees: “They know how to land; they know how to leave. I have a lot of confidence that they’ve learned enough from the lunar work that they’ll be able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_40"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, Tianwen-3’s architecture is simpler than the US-European mission. It has fewer components, and fewer points of potential failure. This also means, though, that the quality of the loot will be somewhat lacking. Tianwen-3 will sample from only one small patch of Mars. Conversely, Perseverance is roving around a vast and geologically diverse landscape, sampling as it goes, which would translate to “literally orders of magnitude more science than what will come from the Chinese samples,” says Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But China could serendipitously land on a biologically rich patch of the planet. As the Southwest Research Institute’s Hamilton says, the mission could “pick up something entirely unexpected and, you know, miraculous.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_42"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The likeliest outcome is still that neither nation finds fossilized microbes, but that China brings back rocks from Mars first. At the end of the day, that’s what Americans (and Europeans) will hear: “You’re second. You lost,” says Mustard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage"&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage__imageWrapper--713fbd99308fe950febff06b694edeaa is-style-full-bleed"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 39.3749rem)" /&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260225_xinmei_TR_RacetoMars_image4_final.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="fullWidthImage__credit--d43dc7ec3d50859db7eb8d2def69081a image-credit"&gt;Xinmei Liu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_44"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many of his colleagues, Christensen is irked by the thought of losing the race to Mars, because it would be such an own goal. The US has been sending robots over there for decades and investing billions in forging the technology that would be required to make MSR a success. And suddenly “the Chinese come along and say, &lt;em&gt;Thank you very much, we’ll take all of that information—we’ll build one mission and go and do what you guys did the groundwork for&lt;/em&gt;,” Christensen says. “As a taxpayer, I’m like: It just seems foolish to me.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the MSR skeptics concede that this kind of loss would have sweeping ramifications. Byrne worries that if something like MSR can be snuffed out so easily, what’s to say the next big mission—to Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond—won’t suffer the same ignoble fate? In other words, the death of MSR would severely damage “the ability of the planetary community to dream big,” he says. “If we don’t pull this off, what does that mean? Are we not going to do big, expensive, difficult things?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another big, expensive, difficult thing? Putting humans on Mars. Both critics and advocates of MSR largely agree it is an invaluable dress rehearsal. Making sure you can safely launch a rocket off Mars is a necessary prerequisite to ensuring that an array of equipment can survive for a long time on the planet’s lethal surface.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China, too, has explicitly acknowledged this. As one of the first lines of the Tianwen-3 study states, “Mars is the most promising planet for humanity’s expansion beyond Earth, with its potential for future habitability and accessible resources.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though such expansion is still of course a far-future dream, it’s not hard to see how losing the race here would put the US at a huge disadvantage. Members of America’s planetary science community say that to try to sway politicians in their favor, they have framed MSR as a national security issue. But they haven’t had much luck. “We’ve been in discussions with decision-makers who have never heard that perspective before,” says the Planetary Society’s Dreier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_46"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is surprising that doesn’t have more weight,” adds Mustard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite months of purgatory, it still stung when the coup de grâce arrived in January. In the draft for a must-pass spending bill, House and Senate appropriators spared NASA from the harshest proposed cuts, thereby saving dozens of spaceflight missions and preserving much of the agency’s planetary science output. But the bill provided absolutely zero political or financial support for MSR. There it was, in black and white: America’s plans to perform a history-making heist on Mars were dead. The bill became law in January and Perseverance, it seems, is now destined to rove alone on the Red Planet until its nuclear battery burns out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This austere reality clashes with the soaring aspirations outlined in the first Planetary Decadal Survey, written just over two decades ago. It stated that the US exploration of the solar system “has a proud past, a productive present, and an auspicious future.” It also noted that “answers to profound questions about our origins and our future may be within our grasp.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now the answers have all but slipped away. Even though Perseverance continues to roam, it’s increasingly likely we’ll never see those promising bespeckled rocks with human eyes, let alone any other rocks the rover finds intriguing. It is far easier to imagine that in the near future, perhaps in the early 2030s, Perseverance will point its camera up at the night sky above Jezero Crater. It will catch a small glimmer: Tianwen-3’s orbiter, preparing to send ancient rocks back to Earth. Meanwhile, Perseverance’s own sample tubes—perhaps some containing signs of life—will be trapped on the Martian surface, gathering dust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1133605" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PIA25738orig.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sample tubes collected by the Perseverance rover may never make it home from the Martian surface.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JPL-CALTECH/MSSS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a sobering thought for Christensen. “We’ll wake up one day and go: What the hell?” he says. “How did we let this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin George Andrews is an award-winning science journalist and doctor of volcanoes based in London.

The company said its batteries can charge super-fast and have a high energy density that would translate to ultra-long-range EVs. What’s more, it claimed the cells can operate safely in the extreme heat and cold, contain “green and abundant materials,” and would cost less than lithium-ion batteries do today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sounded amazing—this sort of technology could transform the EV industry. But many quickly wondered if it was all too good to be true. Now, Donut Lab is releasing a series of videos that it says will prove its technology has the secret sauce. Let’s dig into why this company is making news, why many experts are skeptical, and what it all means for the battery industry right now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries could deliver the next generation of EVs. In place of a liquid electrolyte (the material that ions move through inside a battery), the cells use a solid material, so they can be more compact. That means a significantly longer range, which could get more people excited to drive EVs.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The problem is, getting these batteries to work and making them at the large scale required for the EV industry hasn’t been a simple task. Some of the world’s most powerful automakers and battery companies have been trying for years to get the technology off the ground. (Toyota at one point said it would have solid-state batteries in cars by 2020. Now it’s shooting for 2027 or 2028.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it’s been a long time coming, it does feel as if solid-state batteries are closer than ever. Much of the progress so far has been on semi-solid-state batteries, which use materials like gels for electrolytes. But some companies, including several in China, are getting closer to true solid state. The world’s largest battery company, CATL, plans to manufacture small quantities in 2027. Another major Chinese automaker, Changan, plans to start testing installation of all-solid-state batteries in vehicles this year, with mass production expected to begin next year.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Still, Donut Lab surprised the battery industry when, in a video released in early January ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company claimed it would put the world’s first all-solid-state battery into production vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the splashiest claims in the announcement was that cells would have an energy density of 400 watt-hours per kilogram (the top commercial lithium-ion batteries today sit at about 250 to 300 Wh/kg). It was also claimed that the cells could charge in as little as five minutes, last 100,000 cycles, and retain 99% of capacity at high and low temperatures—while costing less than lithium-ion cells and being made from “100% green and abundant materials with global availability.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many experts were immediately skeptical. “In the solid-state field, the technical barriers are very high,” said Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago, when I spoke with her last month. She’d recently attended CES and visited Donut Lab’s booth. “They had zero demo, so I don’t believe it,” she says. “Call me conservative, but I would rather be careful than be sorry later.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s one of those things where nobody knows—they’ve never heard of it,” said Eric Wachsman, a professor at the University of Maryland and cofounder of the solid-state battery company Ion Storage Systems, in a January interview. “They came out of nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donut Lab has shared very little about what, exactly, this technology might be. It’s not uncommon for battery companies (or any startup, for that matter) to be quiet about technical details before they can get patents filed to protect their technology. But the combination of claims didn’t seem to line up with any known chemistries, leaving experts speculating and, in many cases, doubting Donut Lab’s claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the parameters are contradictory,” said Yang Hongxin, chairman and CEO of the Chinese battery giant Svolt Energy, in remarks to news outlets in January. For example, there’s often a trade-off between high energy density, which requires thicker electrodes that can store more energy, and fast charging, which requires ions to move quickly through cells. High-performance batteries are also expected to be costly, but Donut Lab claims its technology will be cheaper than lithium-ion technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a new video released last week, Donut Lab cofounder and CEO Marko Lehtimäki announced the company would be releasing a video series, called “I Donut Believe,” that would provide evidence for their claims. As a header on the accompanying website reads: “Fair enough. Here you go.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the website went up last week, it included a countdown timer to Monday February 23, when the company released results from its first third-party testing: a fast charging test. The test showed that a single cell could charge from 0% to 80% capacity in about four and a half minutes—incredibly quick and quite impressive results. (One potential caveat to note is that the cells heated up quite a bit, so thermal management could be important in designing vehicles that use these batteries.)&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Even as we see the first technical test results, I’m still left with a lot of questions. How many cycles could this battery do at this charging speed? Can this same cell meet the company’s other performance claims? (I’ve reached out to Donut Lab several times over the past month, both to the company’s press email and to leadership on LinkedIn, but I haven’t gotten a response yet.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has certainly drummed up a lot of interest and attention with its rollout, and the theatrics aren’t over yet. There’s another countdown timer on Donut Lab’s site, which ends on Monday, March 2.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m the first one to get excited about a new battery technology. But there’s a sentiment I’ve seen pop up a lot recently online, and one I can’t get out of my head as I continue to follow this story: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.
