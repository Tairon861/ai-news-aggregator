The company claims its newly released LTX-2 foundation model can generate new content faster than playback speed, plus it raises the bar in resolution and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open-source LTX-2 can generate a stylised, high-definition, six-second video in just five seconds without no compromise in quality, enabling creators to pump out professional content much faster than previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an impressive achievement, but it’s not the only parameter that sets LTX-2 apart from others. It combines native audio and video synthesis with open-source transparency, and if users are willing to wait just a few seconds longer, they can enhance their outputs to 4K resolution at up to 48 frames per second, the company says. Even better, creators can run the software on consumer-grade GPUs, dramatically reducing their compute costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diffusion-models-come-of-age"&gt;Diffusion models come of age&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTX-2 is what’s known as a diffusion model, which works by incrementally adding “noise” to generated content and then reducing that noise until the output resembles the video assets the model has been trained on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With LTX-2, Lightricks has accelerated the diffusion process, so creators can iterate on their ideas by outputting live previews almost instantaneously. The model is also capable of generating accompanying audio at the same time – be it a soundtrack, dialogue or ambient sound effects – dramatically accelerating creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a big deal, as before, creators would have had to conjure up any audio separately from the video, then spend time stitching it together and making sure there’s perfect synchronisation. Google’s Veo models have been celebrated for their powerful integration of synced sound generation, so these new capabilities in LTX serve to reinforce the idea that Lightricks’ tech is on par with the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to access options, Lightricks still offers creators plenty of flexibility with LTX-2. The company’s flagship LTX Studio platform is aimed at professionals, who, in some cases, are willing to sacrifice some speed to create videos at the highest quality. With the ensuing slightly slower rates of processing, they’ll be able to output videos in native 4K resolution at up to 48fps, creating at the same standard expected from cinematic productions, Lightricks claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform offers a wide range of creative controls, affecting the model’s customisable parameters. More details on these will be announced soon, but should include pose and depth controls, video-to-video generation, and rendering alternatives – keep an eye out for a release date, later this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightricks co-founder and Chief Executive Zeev Farbman believes that LTX-2’s enhanced capabilities illustrate the extent to which diffusion models are finally coming of age. He said in a statement that LTX-2 is: “The most complete and comprehensive creative AI engine we’ve ever built, combining synchronised audio and video, 4K fidelity, flexible workflows, and radical efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The isn’t vaporware or a research demo,” he said. “It’s a real breakthrough in video generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-major-milestone"&gt;A major milestone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With LTX-2, Lightricks is demonstrating it’s at the cutting edge of AI video generation, with the platform coming on the back of a number of industry firsts in previous LTXV models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the company’s family of LTXV models, including LTXV-2B and LTXV-13B, became the first to support long-form video generation, which followed an update extending output to up to 60 seconds. With this, AI video production became “truly directed,” with users able to start with an initial prompt, and add further prompts in real-time as video was being streamed live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTXV-13B already had a reputation for being one of the most powerful video creation models around, even before that one minute update. Launching in May, it was the first platform in the industry to support multi-scale rendering, which let users progressively enhance their videos by prompting the model to add more colour and detail, step-by-step, in the same way that professional animators “layer” additional details on top of their work in traditional production processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 13B model was trained on licensed data from Getty and Shutterstock. The company’s partnerships with these content behemoths are important, not only for the quality of the training data, but also for ethical reasons; models’ outputs are far less problematic in terms of copyright, an issue that plagues many other AI models’ creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightricks has also released a distilled version of LTXV-13B that simplifies and speeds up the diffusion process, meaning content can be generated in as little as four-to-eight steps. The distilled version also supports LoRAs, meaning it can be fine-tuned by users to create content that’s more attuned to the aesthetic style of a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovative-billing-models"&gt;Innovative billing models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like those earlier models, LTX-2 will be released under an open-source licence, making it a viable alternative to Alibaba’s Wan2 series of models. Lightricks has stressed that it’s truly open-source, as opposed to just “open access,” which means that its pre-trained weights, datasets, and all tooling will be available on GitHub, alongside the model itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTX-2 is available to users in LTX Studio and through its API as of now, with the open-source version due to be released in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who prefer to use the paid version via API, Lightricks offers flexible pricing, with costs starting at just $0.04 per second for a version that generates HD videos in just five seconds. The Pro version balances speed with performance, and here, prices start at $0.07 per second. The Ultra version costs $0.12 per second for video generation in 4K resolution at 48 fps, plus full-fidelity audio. Prices also vary according to resolution, with users able to choose between 720p, 1080p, 2K and 4K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightricks claims that thanks to the efficiency of the model’s processing, its pricing makes LTX-2 up to 50% cheaper than competing models, making extended projects more economically viable, yet with faster iteration and higher quality than previous generations. Alternatively, users will be able to use the model by downloading the open-source version and running it on consumer-grade GPUs after it lands on GitHub next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dlxmedia-hu-jaTJZMEuf1E-unsplash-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightricks is upping the ante for rapid video creation and iteration with its latest artificial intelligence model.

You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward that billion-ton benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, warns Robert Höglund, cofounder of CDR.fyi, a public-benefit corporation that provides data and analysis on the carbon removal industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re past the peak of expectations,” he says. “And with that, we could see a lot of companies go out of business, which is natural for any industry.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odd quirk of carbon removal is that it never made a lot of sense as a business proposition: It’s an atmospheric cleanup job, necessary for the collective societal good of curbing climate change. But it doesn’t produce a service or product that any individual or organization strictly needs—or is especially eager to pay for.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To date, a number of businesses have voluntarily agreed to buy tons of carbon dioxide that companies intend to eventually suck out of the air. But whether they’re motivated by sincere climate concerns or pressures from investors, employees, or customers, corporate do-goodism will only scale any industry so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most observers argue that whether carbon removal continues to bobble along or transforms into something big enough to make a dent in climate change will depend largely on whether governments around the world decide to pay for a whole, whole lot of it—or force polluters to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Private-sector purchases will never get us there,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “We need policy; it has to be policy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carbon removal sector began to scale up in the early part of this decade, as increasingly grave climate studies revealed the need to dramatically cut emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; suck down vast amounts of carbon dioxide to keep global warming in check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, nations may have to continually remove as much as 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by around midcentury to have a solid chance of keeping the planet from warming past 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a UN climate panel report in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A number of startups sprang up to begin developing the technology and building the infrastructure that would be needed, trying out a variety of approaches like sinking seaweed or building carbon-dioxide-sucking factories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they soon attracted customers. Companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Microsoft, and others began agreeing to pre-purchase tons of carbon removal, hoping to stand up the nascent industry and help offset their own climate emissions. Venture investments also flooded into the space, peaking in 2023 at nearly $1 billion, according to data provided by PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From early on, players in the emerging sector sought to draw a sharp distinction between conventional carbon offset projects, which studies have shown frequently exaggerate climate benefits, and “durable” carbon removal that could be relied upon to suck down and store away the greenhouse gas for decades to centuries. There’s certainly a big difference in the price: While buying carbon offsets through projects that promise to preserve forests or plant trees might cost a few dollars per ton, a ton of carbon removal can run hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;That high price, however, brings big challenges. Removing 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year at, say, $300 a ton adds up to a global price tag of $3 trillion—a year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the fundamental question: Who should or would foot the bill to develop and operate all the factories, pipelines, and wells needed to capture, move, and bury billions upon billions of tons of carbon dioxide?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The state of the market&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The market is still growing, as companies voluntarily purchase tons of carbon removal to make strides toward their climate goals. In fact, sales reached an all-time high in the second quarter of this year, mostly thanks to several massive purchases by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But industry sources fear that demand isn’t growing fast enough to support a significant share of the startups that have formed or even the projects being built, undermining the momentum required to scale the sector up to the size needed by midcentury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, all those hundreds of companies that have spun up in recent years have disclosed deals to sell some 38 million tons of carbon dioxide pulled from the air, according to CDR.fyi. That’s roughly the amount the US pumps out in energy-related emissions every three days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’ve only delivered around 940,000 tons of carbon removal. The US emits that much carbon dioxide in less than two hours. (Not every transaction is publicly announced or revealed to CDR.fyi, so the actual figures could run a bit higher.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another concern is that the same handful of big players continue to account for the vast majority of the overall purchases, leaving the health and direction of the market dependent on their whims and fortunes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most glaringly, Microsoft has agreed to buy 80% of all the carbon removal purchased to date, according to&amp;nbsp; CDR.fyi. The second-biggest buyer is Frontier, a coalition of companies that includes Google, Meta, Stripe, and Shopify, which has committed to spend $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you strip out those two buyers, the market shrinks from 16 million tons under contract during the first half of this year to just 1.2 million, according to data provided to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;by CDR.fyi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Signs of trouble&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the investor appetite for carbon removal is cooling. For the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2025, venture capital investments in the sector fell more than 13% from the same period last year, according to data provided by PitchBook. That tightening funding will make it harder and harder for companies that aren’t bringing in revenue to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Other companies that have already shut down include the carbon removal marketplace Nori, the direct air capture company Noya and Alkali Earth, which was attempting to use industrial by-products to tie up carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still other businesses are struggling. Climeworks, one of the first companies to build direct-air-capture (DAC) factories, announced it was laying off 10% of its staff in May, as it grapples with challenges on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company’s plans to collaborate on the development of a major facility in the US have been at least delayed as the Trump administration has held back tens of millions of dollars in funding granted in 2023 under the Department of Energy’s Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. It now appears the government could terminate the funding altogether, along with perhaps tens of billions of dollars’ worth of additional grants previously awarded for a variety of other US carbon removal and climate tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Market rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,” Christoph Gebald, one of the company’s co-CEOs, said in a previous statement to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “The need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we’re working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But purchases from direct-air-capture projects fell nearly 16% last year and account for just 8% of all carbon removal transactions to date. Buyers are increasingly looking to categories that promise to deliver tons faster and for less money, notably including burying biochar or installing carbon capture equipment on bioenergy plants. (Read more in my recent story on that method of carbon removal, known as BECCS, here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CDR.fyi recently described the climate for direct air capture in grim terms: “The sector has grown rapidly, but the honeymoon is over: Investment and sales are falling, while deployments are delayed across almost every company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most DAC companies,” the organization added, “will fold or be acquired.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, most observers believe carbon removal isn’t really going to take off unless governments bring their resources and regulations to bear. That could mean making direct purchases, subsidizing these sectors, or getting polluters to pay the costs to do so—for instance, by folding carbon removal into market-based emissions reductions mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More government support does appear to be on the way. Notably, the European Commission recently proposed allowing “domestic carbon removal” within its EU Emissions Trading System after 2030, integrating the sector into one of the largest cap-and-trade programs. The system forces power plants and other polluters in member countries to increasingly cut their emissions or pay for them over time, as the cap on pollution tightens and the price on carbon rises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could create incentives for more European companies to pay direct-air-capture or bioenergy facilities to draw down carbon dioxide as a means of helping them meet their climate obligations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN organization that establishes standards for the aviation industry, is considering incorporating carbon removal into its market-based mechanism for reducing the sector’s emissions. That might take several forms, including allowing airlines to purchase carbon removal to offset their use of traditional jet fuel or requiring the use of carbon dioxide obtained through direct air capture in some share of sustainable aviation fuels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Canada has committed to spend $10 million on carbon removal and is developing a protocol to allow direct air capture in its national offsets program. And Japan will begin accepting several categories of carbon removal in its emissions trading system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back funding for the development of carbon-sucking projects, the US does continue to subsidize storage of carbon dioxide, whether it comes from power plants, ethanol refineries, direct-air-capture plants, or other facilities. The so-called 45Q tax credit, which is worth up to $180 a ton, was among the few forms of government support for climate-tech-related sectors that survived in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill. In fact, the subsidies for putting carbon dioxide to other uses increased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in the current US political climate, Burns is hopeful that local or federal legislators will continue to enact policies that support specific categories of carbon removal in the regions where they make the most sense, because the projects can provide economic growth and jobs as well as climate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think there are lots of models for what carbon removal policy can look like that aren’t just things like tax incentives,” she says. “And I think that this particular political moment gives us the opportunity in a unique way to start to look at what those regionally specific and pathway specific policies look like.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dangers ahead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if more nations do provide the money or enact the laws necessary to drive the business of durable carbon renewal forward, there are mounting concerns that a sector conceived as an alternative to dubious offset markets could increasingly come to replicate their problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Various incentives are pulling in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Financial pressures are building on suppliers to deliver tons of carbon removal. Corporate buyers are looking for the fastest and most affordable way of hitting their climate goals. And the organizations that set standards and accredit carbon removal projects often earn more money as the volume of purchases rises, creating clear conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the same carbon registries that have long signed off on carbon offset projects have begun creating standards or issuing credits for various forms of carbon removal, including Verra and Gold Standard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reliable assurance that a project’s declared ton of carbon savings equates to a real ton of emissions removed, reduced, or avoided is crucial,” Cynthia Giles, a senior EPA advisor under President Biden, and Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent editorial in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “Yet extensive research from many contexts shows that auditors selected and paid by audited organizations often produce results skewed toward those entities’ interests.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Noah McQueen, the director of science and innovation at Carbon180, has stressed that the industry must strive to counter the mounting credibility risks, noting in a recent LinkedIn post: “Growth matters, but growth without integrity isn’t growth at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an interview, McQueen said that heading off the problem will require developing and enforcing standards to truly ensure that carbon removal projects deliver the climate benefits promised. McQueen added that to gain trust, the industry needs to earn buy-in from the communities in which these projects are built and avoid the environmental and health impacts that power plants and heavy industry have historically inflicted on disadvantaged communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting it right will require governments to take a larger role in the sector than just subsidizing it, argues David Ho, a professor at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa who focuses&amp;nbsp; on ocean-based carbon removal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says there should be a massive, multinational research drive to determine the most effective ways of mopping up the atmosphere with minimal environmental or social harm, likening it to a Manhattan Project (minus the whole nuclear bomb bit).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we’re serious about doing this, then let’s make it a government effort,” he says, “so that you can try out all the things, determine what works and what doesn’t, and you don’t have to please your VCs or concentrate on developing [intellectual property] so you can sell yourself to a fossil-fuel company.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ho adds that there’s a moral imperative for the world’s historically biggest climate polluters to build and pay for the carbon-sucking and storage infrastructure required to draw down billions of tons of greenhouse gas. That’s because the world’s poorest, hottest nations, which have contributed the least to climate change, will nevertheless face the greatest dangers from intensifying heat waves, droughts, famines, and sea-level rise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It should be seen as waste management for the waste we’re going to dump on the Global South,” he says, “because they’re the people who will suffer the most from climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction (October 24): An earlier version of this article referred to Noya as a carbon removal marketplace.

You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward that billion-ton benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, warns Robert Höglund, cofounder of CDR.fyi, a public-benefit corporation that provides data and analysis on the carbon removal industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re past the peak of expectations,” he says. “And with that, we could see a lot of companies go out of business, which is natural for any industry.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odd quirk of carbon removal is that it never made a lot of sense as a business proposition: It’s an atmospheric cleanup job, necessary for the collective societal good of curbing climate change. But it doesn’t produce a service or product that any individual or organization strictly needs—or is especially eager to pay for.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To date, a number of businesses have voluntarily agreed to buy tons of carbon dioxide that companies intend to eventually suck out of the air. But whether they’re motivated by sincere climate concerns or pressures from investors, employees, or customers, corporate do-goodism will only scale any industry so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most observers argue that whether carbon removal continues to bobble along or transforms into something big enough to make a dent in climate change will depend largely on whether governments around the world decide to pay for a whole, whole lot of it—or force polluters to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Private-sector purchases will never get us there,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “We need policy; it has to be policy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carbon removal sector began to scale up in the early part of this decade, as increasingly grave climate studies revealed the need to dramatically cut emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; suck down vast amounts of carbon dioxide to keep global warming in check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, nations may have to continually remove as much as 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by around midcentury to have a solid chance of keeping the planet from warming past 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a UN climate panel report in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A number of startups sprang up to begin developing the technology and building the infrastructure that would be needed, trying out a variety of approaches like sinking seaweed or building carbon-dioxide-sucking factories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they soon attracted customers. Companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Microsoft, and others began agreeing to pre-purchase tons of carbon removal, hoping to stand up the nascent industry and help offset their own climate emissions. Venture investments also flooded into the space, peaking in 2023 at nearly $1 billion, according to data provided by PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From early on, players in the emerging sector sought to draw a sharp distinction between conventional carbon offset projects, which studies have shown frequently exaggerate climate benefits, and “durable” carbon removal that could be relied upon to suck down and store away the greenhouse gas for decades to centuries. There’s certainly a big difference in the price: While buying carbon offsets through projects that promise to preserve forests or plant trees might cost a few dollars per ton, a ton of carbon removal can run hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;That high price, however, brings big challenges. Removing 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year at, say, $300 a ton adds up to a global price tag of $3 trillion—a year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the fundamental question: Who should or would foot the bill to develop and operate all the factories, pipelines, and wells needed to capture, move, and bury billions upon billions of tons of carbon dioxide?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The state of the market&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The market is still growing, as companies voluntarily purchase tons of carbon removal to make strides toward their climate goals. In fact, sales reached an all-time high in the second quarter of this year, mostly thanks to several massive purchases by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But industry sources fear that demand isn’t growing fast enough to support a significant share of the startups that have formed or even the projects being built, undermining the momentum required to scale the sector up to the size needed by midcentury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, all those hundreds of companies that have spun up in recent years have disclosed deals to sell some 38 million tons of carbon dioxide pulled from the air, according to CDR.fyi. That’s roughly the amount the US pumps out in energy-related emissions every three days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’ve only delivered around 940,000 tons of carbon removal. The US emits that much carbon dioxide in less than two hours. (Not every transaction is publicly announced or revealed to CDR.fyi, so the actual figures could run a bit higher.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another concern is that the same handful of big players continue to account for the vast majority of the overall purchases, leaving the health and direction of the market dependent on their whims and fortunes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most glaringly, Microsoft has agreed to buy 80% of all the carbon removal purchased to date, according to&amp;nbsp; CDR.fyi. The second-biggest buyer is Frontier, a coalition of companies that includes Google, Meta, Stripe, and Shopify, which has committed to spend $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you strip out those two buyers, the market shrinks from 16 million tons under contract during the first half of this year to just 1.2 million, according to data provided to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;by CDR.fyi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Signs of trouble&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the investor appetite for carbon removal is cooling. For the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2025, venture capital investments in the sector fell more than 13% from the same period last year, according to data provided by PitchBook. That tightening funding will make it harder and harder for companies that aren’t bringing in revenue to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Other companies that have already shut down include the carbon removal marketplace Nori, the direct air capture company Noya and Alkali Earth, which was attempting to use industrial by-products to tie up carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still other businesses are struggling. Climeworks, one of the first companies to build direct-air-capture (DAC) factories, announced it was laying off 10% of its staff in May, as it grapples with challenges on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company’s plans to collaborate on the development of a major facility in the US have been at least delayed as the Trump administration has held back tens of millions of dollars in funding granted in 2023 under the Department of Energy’s Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. It now appears the government could terminate the funding altogether, along with perhaps tens of billions of dollars’ worth of additional grants previously awarded for a variety of other US carbon removal and climate tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Market rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,” Christoph Gebald, one of the company’s co-CEOs, said in a previous statement to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “The need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we’re working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But purchases from direct-air-capture projects fell nearly 16% last year and account for just 8% of all carbon removal transactions to date. Buyers are increasingly looking to categories that promise to deliver tons faster and for less money, notably including burying biochar or installing carbon capture equipment on bioenergy plants. (Read more in my recent story on that method of carbon removal, known as BECCS, here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CDR.fyi recently described the climate for direct air capture in grim terms: “The sector has grown rapidly, but the honeymoon is over: Investment and sales are falling, while deployments are delayed across almost every company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most DAC companies,” the organization added, “will fold or be acquired.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, most observers believe carbon removal isn’t really going to take off unless governments bring their resources and regulations to bear. That could mean making direct purchases, subsidizing these sectors, or getting polluters to pay the costs to do so—for instance, by folding carbon removal into market-based emissions reductions mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More government support does appear to be on the way. Notably, the European Commission recently proposed allowing “domestic carbon removal” within its EU Emissions Trading System after 2030, integrating the sector into one of the largest cap-and-trade programs. The system forces power plants and other polluters in member countries to increasingly cut their emissions or pay for them over time, as the cap on pollution tightens and the price on carbon rises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could create incentives for more European companies to pay direct-air-capture or bioenergy facilities to draw down carbon dioxide as a means of helping them meet their climate obligations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN organization that establishes standards for the aviation industry, is considering incorporating carbon removal into its market-based mechanism for reducing the sector’s emissions. That might take several forms, including allowing airlines to purchase carbon removal to offset their use of traditional jet fuel or requiring the use of carbon dioxide obtained through direct air capture in some share of sustainable aviation fuels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Canada has committed to spend $10 million on carbon removal and is developing a protocol to allow direct air capture in its national offsets program. And Japan will begin accepting several categories of carbon removal in its emissions trading system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back funding for the development of carbon-sucking projects, the US does continue to subsidize storage of carbon dioxide, whether it comes from power plants, ethanol refineries, direct-air-capture plants, or other facilities. The so-called 45Q tax credit, which is worth up to $180 a ton, was among the few forms of government support for climate-tech-related sectors that survived in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill. In fact, the subsidies for putting carbon dioxide to other uses increased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in the current US political climate, Burns is hopeful that local or federal legislators will continue to enact policies that support specific categories of carbon removal in the regions where they make the most sense, because the projects can provide economic growth and jobs as well as climate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think there are lots of models for what carbon removal policy can look like that aren’t just things like tax incentives,” she says. “And I think that this particular political moment gives us the opportunity in a unique way to start to look at what those regionally specific and pathway specific policies look like.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dangers ahead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if more nations do provide the money or enact the laws necessary to drive the business of durable carbon renewal forward, there are mounting concerns that a sector conceived as an alternative to dubious offset markets could increasingly come to replicate their problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Various incentives are pulling in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Financial pressures are building on suppliers to deliver tons of carbon removal.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain can be notoriously difficult to describe, as almost everyone who has ever been asked to will know. &lt;/strong&gt;At a recent medical visit, my doctor asked me to rank my pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I found it incredibly difficult to do. A 10, she said, meant “the worst pain imaginable,” which brought back unpleasant memories of having appendicitis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A short while before the problem that brought me in, I’d broken my toe in two places, which had hurt like a mother—but less than appendicitis. If appendicitis was a 10, breaking a toe was an 8, I figured. If that was the case, maybe my current pain was a 6. As a pain score, it didn’t sound as bad as I actually felt. I couldn’t help wondering if I might have given a higher score if my appendix were still intact. I wondered, too, how someone else with my medical issue might score their pain.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In truth, we all experience pain in our own unique ways.&lt;/strong&gt; Pain is subjective, and it is influenced by our past experiences, our&amp;nbsp;moods, and our expectations. The way people describe their pain can vary tremendously, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve known this for ages. In the 1940s, the anesthesiologist Henry Beecher noted that&amp;nbsp;wounded soldiers were much less likely to ask for pain relief than similarly injured people in civilian hospitals. Perhaps they were putting on a brave face, or maybe they just felt lucky to be alive, given their circumstances. We have no way of knowing how much pain they were really feeling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given this messy picture, I can see the appeal of a simple test that can score pain and help medical professionals understand how best to treat their patients. That’s what is being offered by PainChek, the smartphone app Deena wrote about. The app works by assessing small facial movements, such as lip raises or brow pinches. A user is then required to fill a separate checklist to identify other signs of pain the patient might be displaying. It seems to work well, and it is already being used in hospitals and care settings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the app is judged against subjective reports of pain.&lt;/strong&gt; It might be useful for assessing the pain of people who can’t describe it themselves—perhaps because they have dementia, for example—but it won’t add much to assessments from people who can already communicate their pain levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other complications. Say a test could spot that a person was experiencing pain. What can a doctor do with that information? Perhaps prescribe pain relief—but most of the pain-relieving drugs we have were designed to treat acute, short-term pain. If a person is grimacing from a chronic pain condition, the treatment options are more limited, says Stuart Derbyshire, a pain neuroscientist at the National University of Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The last time I spoke to Derbyshire was back in 2010, when I covered&amp;nbsp;work by researchers in London who were using brain scans to measure pain. That was 15 years ago. But pain-measuring brain scanners are yet to become a routine part of clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That scoring system was also built on subjective pain reports.&lt;/strong&gt; Those reports are, as Derbyshire puts it, “baked into the system.” It’s not ideal, but when it comes down to it, we must rely on these wobbly, malleable, and sometimes incoherent self-descriptions of pain. It’s the best we have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Derbyshire says he doesn’t think we’ll ever have a “pain-o-meter” that can tell you what a person is truly experiencing. “Subjective report is the gold standard, and I think it always will be,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Anthropic now serves more than 300,000 business customers, with large accounts—defined as those representing over US$100,000 in annual run-rate revenue—growing nearly sevenfold in the past year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This customer growth trajectory, concentrated among Fortune 500 companies and AI-native startups, suggests that Claude’s adoption in enterprise environments is accelerating beyond early experimentation phases into production-grade implementations where infrastructure reliability, cost management, and performance consistency become non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-multi-cloud-calculus"&gt;The multi-cloud calculus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes this announcement from typical vendor partnerships is Anthropic’s explicit articulation of a diversified compute strategy. The company operates across three distinct chip platforms: Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, and NVIDIA’s GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFO Krishna Rao emphasised that Amazon remains the primary training partner and cloud provider, with ongoing work on Project Rainier—a massive compute cluster spanning hundreds of thousands of AI chips across multiple US data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology leaders evaluating their own AI infrastructure roadmaps, this multi-platform approach warrants attention. It reflects a pragmatic recognition that no single accelerator architecture or cloud ecosystem optimally serves all workloads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training large language models, fine-tuning for domain-specific applications, serving inference at scale, and conducting alignment research each present different computational profiles, cost structures, and latency requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic implication for CTOs and CIOs is clear: vendor lock-in at the infrastructure layer carries increasing risk as AI workloads mature. Organisations building long-term AI capabilities should evaluate how model providers’ own architectural choices—and their ability to port workloads across platforms—translate into flexibility, pricing leverage, and continuity assurance for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-price-performance-and-the-economics-of-scale"&gt;Price-performance and the economics of scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian attributed Anthropic’s expanded TPU commitment to “strong price-performance and efficiency” demonstrated over several years. While specific benchmark comparisons remain proprietary, the economics underlying this choice matter significantly for enterprise AI budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPUs, purpose-built for tensor operations central to neural network computation, typically offer advantages in throughput and energy efficiency for specific model architectures compared to general-purpose GPUs. The announcement’s reference to “over a gigawatt of capacity” is instructive: power consumption and cooling infrastructure increasingly constrain AI deployment at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises operating on-premises AI infrastructure or negotiating colocation agreements, understanding the total cost of ownership—including facilities, power, and operational overhead—becomes as critical as raw compute pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood and referenced in the announcement, represents Google’s latest iteration in AI accelerator design. While technical specifications remain limited in public documentation, the maturity of Google’s AI accelerator portfolio—developed over nearly a decade—provides a counterpoint to enterprises evaluating newer entrants in the AI chip market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proven production history, extensive tooling integration, and supply chain stability carry weight in enterprise procurement decisions where continuity risk can derail multi-year AI initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-enterprise-ai-strategy"&gt;Implications for enterprise AI strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several strategic considerations emerge from Anthropic’s infrastructure expansion for enterprise leaders planning their own AI investments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity planning and vendor relationships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The scale of this commitment—tens of billions of dollars—illustrates the capital intensity required to serve enterprise AI demand at production scale. Organisations relying on foundation model APIs should assess their providers’ capacity roadmaps and diversification strategies to mitigate service availability risks during demand spikes or geopolitical supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment and safety testing at scale:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic explicitly connects this expanded infrastructure to “more thorough testing, alignment research, and responsible deployment.” For enterprises in regulated industries—financial services, healthcare, government contracting—the computational resources dedicated to safety and alignment directly impact model reliability and compliance posture. Procurement conversations should address not just model performance metrics, but the testing and validation infrastructure supporting responsible deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with enterprise AI ecosystems:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;While this announcement focuses on Google Cloud infrastructure, enterprise AI implementations increasingly span multiple platforms.&amp;nbsp;Organisations using AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, or other model orchestration layers must understand how foundation model&amp;nbsp;providers’ infrastructure choicesaffect API performance, regional availability, and compliance certifications across different cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The competitive landscape:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Anthropic’s aggressive infrastructure expansion occurs against intensifying competition from OpenAI, Meta, and other well-capitalised model providers. For enterprise buyers, this capital deployment race translates into continuous model capability improvements—but also potential pricing pressure, vendor consolidation, and shifting partnership dynamics that require active vendor management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader context for this announcement includes growing enterprise scrutiny of AI infrastructure costs.&amp;nbsp;As organisations&amp;nbsp;move&amp;nbsp;from pilot projects to production deployments, infrastructure efficiency&amp;nbsp;directly impacts&amp;nbsp;AI ROI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s choice to diversify across TPUs, Trainium, and GPUs—rather than standardising on a single platform—suggests that no dominant architecture has emerged for all enterprise AI workloads.

Even the best AI isn’t helpful if it can’t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don’t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft’s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google’s Vertex AI, Salesforce’s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-third-party-data-for-chatgpt-enterprise-tasks"&gt;OpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it’s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI ChatGPT AI virtual assistant connecting to enterprise apps to surface company knowledge." class="wp-image-110019" height="577" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis.

Even the best AI isn’t helpful if it can’t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don’t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft’s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google’s Vertex AI, Salesforce’s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock. Everyone is racing to connect models to secure company data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-third-party-data-for-chatgpt-enterprise-tasks"&gt;OpenAI uses third-party data for ChatGPT enterprise tasks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT will connect to apps like Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, and GitHub. OpenAI says it’s powered by a version of GPT-5, trained to check many sources for better answers. For checking and validation, every answer shows where the info came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI ChatGPT AI virtual assistant connecting to enterprise apps to surface company knowledge." class="wp-image-110019" height="577" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1024x577.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This changes what you can do from simple writing to complex analysis.

They could be especially useful in the care of people who aren’t able to tell others how they are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But they are far from perfect.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-test-the-tech-meet-the-founders-strike-the-deal"&gt;Test the tech. Meet the founders. Strike the deal.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the stages set the vision, the exhibits bring it to life. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupt Expo Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;buzzes with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hundreds of startups &lt;/strong&gt;redefining what’s&amp;nbsp;next — from AI stacks and&amp;nbsp;developer&amp;nbsp;tooling to fintech rails, global HR, cybersecurity, and space and aerospace innovation. This is where discovery happens in real time. Test the tech. Meet the founders. Spark collaborations that leap from prototype to partnership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;See the full list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You’ll&amp;nbsp;find investors scouting their next big bet, VCs comparing notes, and founders pitching with the kind of energy only Disrupt inspires. This is where innovation feels tangible — and contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s&amp;nbsp;even more happening off stage — across San Francisco’s bars, venues, and hot spots. The&amp;nbsp;Disrupt 2025 experience&amp;nbsp;expands through&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Side Events&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that turn the city into&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;one massive networking circuit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cocktail parties&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;happy hours&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;meetups&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mixers&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;job fairs&lt;/strong&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;late-night pitch sessions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;run long after the expo closes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grab a coffee with your next investor, swap stories at an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;AI meetup&lt;/strong&gt;, or close a deal at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Future of Work mixer.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;a networking event or a rooftop gathering, every conversation carries startup potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These side events blur the line between conference and community — where investors, entrepreneurs, and innovators&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;move from information gathering&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;to&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;closing deals.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Explore your Disrupt 2025 ticket options.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Forget just rockets and satellites. The real revolution in space isn’t in what we launch, but in the intelligence we deploy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Space has become the ultimate data frontier. To truly harness it, we need more than just pipes; we need brains in orbit. This is the age of on-orbit compute and autonomous decision-making, where intelligent edge systems instantly transform raw satellite feeds into actionable insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI isn’t just optimizing missions — it’s &lt;em&gt;transforming&lt;/em&gt; them. It is the engine for unprecedented speed, efficiency, and resilience, enabling missions to be managed and scaled like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This Space Stage session, only at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, cuts through the noise to showcase the true innovators: those pushing intelligence to the absolute edge, fundamentally redefining the speed, efficiency, and resilience of operations in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron-rag"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Expands Open Access to Nemotron RAG Models 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is making eight NVIDIA Nemotron RAG models openly available on Hugging Face, expanding access beyond research to include the full suite of commercial models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release gives developers a wider range of tools to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, improve search and ranking accuracy, and extract structured data from complex documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly released models include Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B, which provides multilingual text embeddings built on Llama 3.1, and Omni-Embed-Nemotron-3B, which supports cross-modal retrieval for text, images, audio and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can also access six production-grade models for text embedding, reranking and PDF data extraction — key components for real-world retrieval and document intelligence applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these open-source models, developers, researchers and organizations can more easily integrate and experiment with RAG-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can get started with Nemotron RAG on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="datasets"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building and Training AI Models With the Latest Open Datasets 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is expanding access to high-quality open datasets that help developers overcome the challenges of large-scale data collection and focus on building advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest release includes a collection of &lt;b&gt;Nemotron-Personas datasets for Sovereign AI&lt;/b&gt;. Each dataset is fully synthetic and grounded in real-world demographic, geographic and cultural data — with no personally identifiable information. The growing collection, which features personas from the U.S., Japan and India, enables model builders to design AI agents and systems that reflect the linguistic, social and contextual nuance of the nations they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA earlier this year released the &lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Physical AI Open Datasets&lt;/b&gt; on Hugging Face, featuring more than 7 million robotics trajectories and 1,000 OpenUSD SimReady assets. Downloaded more than 6 million times, the datasets combines real‑world and synthetic data from the NVIDIA Cosmos,  Isaac, DRIVE and Metropolis platforms to kickstart physical AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="startup-showcase"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NVIDIA Inception Startups Highlight AI Innovation 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86210 size-medium" height="640" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PTC-Startup-Winners-960x640.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PyTorch Conference’s Startup Showcase, 11 startups — including members from the NVIDIA Inception program — are sharing their work developing practical AI applications and connecting with investors, potential customers and peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runhouse, an AI infrastructure startup optimizing model deployment and orchestration, was crowned the 2025 PyTorch Startup Showcase Award Winner.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlights From Open Source AI Week 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of Open Source AI Week are getting a peek at the latest advancements and creative projects that are shaping the future of open technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happening onsite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world’s smallest AI supercomputer: &lt;/b&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark represents the cutting edge of AI computing hardware for enterprise and research applications.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86192 size-thumbnail" height="400" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitree-blog-400x400.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why open source is important:&lt;/b&gt; Learn how it can empower developers to build stronger communities, iterate on features, and seamlessly integrate the best of open source AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="research"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating AI Research Through Open Models 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) published today shows how access to open model weights unlocks more opportunities for experimentation, customization and collaboration across the global research community.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report outlines seven high-impact research use cases where open models are making a difference — including fine-tuning, continued pretraining, model compression and interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to weights, developers can adapt models for new domains, explore new architectures and extend functionality to meet their specific needs. This also supports trust and reproducibility. When teams can run experiments on their own hardware, share updates and revisit earlier versions, they gain control and confidence in their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that nearly all open model users share their data, weights and code, building a fast-growing culture of collaboration. This open exchange of tools and knowledge strengthens partnerships between academia, startups and enterprises, facilitating innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is committed to empowering the research community through the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models — featuring not just open weights, but also pretraining and post-training datasets, detailed training recipes, and research papers that share the latest breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full CSET study to learn how open models are helping the AI community move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="keynote"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing Embodied Intelligence Through Open-Source Innovation 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86142 size-medium" height="540" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ptc-keynote-960x540.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PyTorch Conference, Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, discussed the Physical Turing Test — a way of measuring the performance of intelligent machines in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conversational AI now capable of fluent, lifelike communication, Fan noted that the next challenge is enabling machines to act with similar naturalism. The Physical Turing Test asks: can an intelligent machine perform a real-world task so fluidly that a human cannot tell whether a person or a robot completed it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan highlighted that progress in embodied AI and physical AI depends on generating large amounts of diverse data, access to open robot foundation models and simulation frameworks — and walked through a unified workflow for developing embodied AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With synthetic data workflows like NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams — built on NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models— developers can generate virtual worlds from images and prompts, speeding the creation of large sets of diverse and physically accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That data can then be used to post-train NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N open foundation models for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. But before the models are deployed in the real world, these new robot skills need to be tested in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open simulation and learning frameworks such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab allow robots to “practice” countless times across millions of virtual environments before operating in the real world, dramatically accelerating learning and deployment cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with Newton, an open-source, differentiable physics engine built on NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD, developers can bring high-fidelity simulation to complex robotic dynamics such as motion, balance and contact — reducing the simulation-to-real gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accelerates the creation of physically capable AI systems that learn faster, perform more safely and operate effectively in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scaling embodied intelligence isn’t just about compute — it’s about access. Fan reaffirmed NVIDIA’s commitment to open source, emphasizing how the company’s frameworks and foundation models are shared to empower developers and researchers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can get started with NVIDIA’s open embodied and physical AI models on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B Ranks Among Top Open Models for Multilingual Retrieval 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B model has been recognized as the top open and portable model on the Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the meta‑llama/Llama‑3.1‑8B architecture, Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B is a research text embedding model that converts text into 4,096‑dimensional vector representations. Designed for flexibility, it supports a wide range of use cases, including retrieval, reranking, semantic similarity and classification across more than 1,000 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on a diverse collection of 16 million query–document pairs — half from public sources and half synthetically generated — the model benefits from refined data generation techniques, hard‑negative mining and model‑merging approaches that contribute to its broad generalization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result builds on NVIDIA’s ongoing research in open, high‑performing AI models. Following earlier leaderboard recognition for the Llama NeMo Retriever ColEmbed model, the success of Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B highlights the value of openness, transparency and collaboration in advancing AI for the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B on Hugging Face, and learn more about the model, including architectural highlights, training methodology and performance evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86053" height="470" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter-7.gif" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Open Source Teaches Us About Making AI Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open models are shaping the future of AI, enabling developers, enterprises and governments to innovate with transparency, customization and trust. In the latest episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, NVIDIA’s Bryan Catanzaro and Jonathan Cohen discuss how open models, datasets and research are laying the foundation for shared progress across the AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models represents a full-stack approach to AI development, connecting model design to the underlying hardware and software that power it. By releasing Nemotron models, data and training methodologies openly, NVIDIA aims to help others refine, adapt and build upon its work, resulting in a faster exchange of ideas and more efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we as a community come together — contributing ideas, data and models — we all move faster,” said Catanzaro in the episode. “Open technologies make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more happening this week at Open Source AI Week, including the start of the PyTorch Conference — bringing together developers, researchers and innovators pushing the boundaries of open AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Nanochat Teaches Developers How to Train LLMs in Four Hours 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientist Andrej Karpathy recently introduced Nanochat, calling it “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.” Nanochat is an open-source, full-stack large language model (LLM) implementation built for transparency and experimentation. In about 8,000 lines of minimal, dependency-light code, Nanochat runs the entire LLM pipeline — from tokenization and pretraining to fine-tuning, inference and chat — all through a simple web user interface.&lt;br /&gt;NVIDIA is supporting Karpathy’s open-source Nanochat project by releasing two NVIDIA Launchables, making it easy to deploy and experiment with Nanochat across various NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVIDIA Launchables, developers can train and interact with their own conversational model in hours with a single click. The Launchables dynamically support different-sized GPUs — including NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs — on various clouds without need for modification. They also automatically work on any eight-GPU instance on NVIDIA Brev, so developers can get compute access immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first 10 users&lt;/b&gt; to deploy these Launchables will also receive free compute access to NVIDIA H100 or L40S GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training with Nanochat by deploying a Launchable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86022 size-medium" height="527" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/launchable-960x527.png" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Next Experiments Begin With NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pytorch"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Future of AI With PyTorch and NVIDIA 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyTorch, the fastest-growing AI framework, derives its performance from the NVIDIA CUDA platform and uses the Python programming language to unlock developer productivity. This year, NVIDIA added Python as a first-class language to the CUDA platform, giving the PyTorch developer community greater access to CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUDA Python includes key components that make GPU acceleration in Python easier than ever, with built-in support for kernel fusion, extension module integration and simplified packaging for fast deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following PyTorch’s open collaboration model, CUDA Python is available on GitHub and PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlights From Open Source AI Week 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of Open Source AI Week are getting a peek at the latest advancements and creative projects that are shaping the future of open technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what’s happening onsite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world’s smallest AI supercomputer: &lt;/b&gt;NVIDIA DGX Spark represents the cutting edge of AI computing hardware for enterprise and research applications.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86192 size-thumbnail" height="400" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitree-blog-400x400.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why open source is important:&lt;/b&gt; Learn how it can empower developers to build stronger communities, iterate on features, and seamlessly integrate the best of open source AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="research"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerating AI Research Through Open Models 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) published today shows how access to open model weights unlocks more opportunities for experimentation, customization and collaboration across the global research community.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report outlines seven high-impact research use cases where open models are making a difference — including fine-tuning, continued pretraining, model compression and interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to weights, developers can adapt models for new domains, explore new architectures and extend functionality to meet their specific needs. This also supports trust and reproducibility. When teams can run experiments on their own hardware, share updates and revisit earlier versions, they gain control and confidence in their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that nearly all open model users share their data, weights and code, building a fast-growing culture of collaboration. This open exchange of tools and knowledge strengthens partnerships between academia, startups and enterprises, facilitating innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is committed to empowering the research community through the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models — featuring not just open weights, but also pretraining and post-training datasets, detailed training recipes, and research papers that share the latest breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full CSET study to learn how open models are helping the AI community move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="keynote"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing Embodied Intelligence Through Open-Source Innovation 🔗&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86142 size-medium" height="540" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ptc-keynote-960x540.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PyTorch Conference, Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, discussed the Physical Turing Test — a way of measuring the performance of intelligent machines in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With conversational AI now capable of fluent, lifelike communication, Fan noted that the next challenge is enabling machines to act with similar naturalism. The Physical Turing Test asks: can an intelligent machine perform a real-world task so fluidly that a human cannot tell whether a person or a robot completed it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan highlighted that progress in embodied AI and physical AI depends on generating large amounts of diverse data, access to open robot foundation models and simulation frameworks — and walked through a unified workflow for developing embodied AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With synthetic data workflows like NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams — built on NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models— developers can generate virtual worlds from images and prompts, speeding the creation of large sets of diverse and physically accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That data can then be used to post-train NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N open foundation models for generalized humanoid robot reasoning and skills. But before the models are deployed in the real world, these new robot skills need to be tested in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open simulation and learning frameworks such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab allow robots to “practice” countless times across millions of virtual environments before operating in the real world, dramatically accelerating learning and deployment cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with Newton, an open-source, differentiable physics engine built on NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD, developers can bring high-fidelity simulation to complex robotic dynamics such as motion, balance and contact — reducing the simulation-to-real gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accelerates the creation of physically capable AI systems that learn faster, perform more safely and operate effectively in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scaling embodied intelligence isn’t just about compute — it’s about access. Fan reaffirmed NVIDIA’s commitment to open source, emphasizing how the company’s frameworks and foundation models are shared to empower developers and researchers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can get started with NVIDIA’s open embodied and physical AI models on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B Ranks Among Top Open Models for Multilingual Retrieval 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B model has been recognized as the top open and portable model on the Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the meta‑llama/Llama‑3.1‑8B architecture, Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B is a research text embedding model that converts text into 4,096‑dimensional vector representations. Designed for flexibility, it supports a wide range of use cases, including retrieval, reranking, semantic similarity and classification across more than 1,000 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on a diverse collection of 16 million query–document pairs — half from public sources and half synthetically generated — the model benefits from refined data generation techniques, hard‑negative mining and model‑merging approaches that contribute to its broad generalization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result builds on NVIDIA’s ongoing research in open, high‑performing AI models. Following earlier leaderboard recognition for the Llama NeMo Retriever ColEmbed model, the success of Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B highlights the value of openness, transparency and collaboration in advancing AI for the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B on Hugging Face, and learn more about the model, including architectural highlights, training methodology and performance evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Open Source Teaches Us About Making AI Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open models are shaping the future of AI, enabling developers, enterprises and governments to innovate with transparency, customization and trust. In the latest episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, NVIDIA’s Bryan Catanzaro and Jonathan Cohen discuss how open models, datasets and research are laying the foundation for shared progress across the AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models represents a full-stack approach to AI development, connecting model design to the underlying hardware and software that power it. By releasing Nemotron models, data and training methodologies openly, NVIDIA aims to help others refine, adapt and build upon its work, resulting in a faster exchange of ideas and more efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we as a community come together — contributing ideas, data and models — we all move faster,” said Catanzaro in the episode. “Open technologies make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more happening this week at Open Source AI Week, including the start of the PyTorch Conference — bringing together developers, researchers and innovators pushing the boundaries of open AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Nanochat Teaches Developers How to Train LLMs in Four Hours 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientist Andrej Karpathy recently introduced Nanochat, calling it “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.” Nanochat is an open-source, full-stack large language model (LLM) implementation built for transparency and experimentation. In about 8,000 lines of minimal, dependency-light code, Nanochat runs the entire LLM pipeline — from tokenization and pretraining to fine-tuning, inference and chat — all through a simple web user interface.&lt;br /&gt;NVIDIA is supporting Karpathy’s open-source Nanochat project by releasing two NVIDIA Launchables, making it easy to deploy and experiment with Nanochat across various NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVIDIA Launchables, developers can train and interact with their own conversational model in hours with a single click. The Launchables dynamically support different-sized GPUs — including NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs — on various clouds without need for modification. They also automatically work on any eight-GPU instance on NVIDIA Brev, so developers can get compute access immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first 10 users&lt;/b&gt; to deploy these Launchables will also receive free compute access to NVIDIA H100 or L40S GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start training with Nanochat by deploying a Launchable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter wp-image-86022 size-medium" height="527" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/launchable-960x527.png" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Next Experiments Begin With NVIDIA DGX Spark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Karpathy received an NVIDIA DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer, designed to bring the power of Blackwell right to a developer’s desktop. With up to a petaflop of AI processing power and 128GB of unified memory in a compact form factor, DGX Spark empowers innovators like Karpathy to experiment, fine-tune and run massive models locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, Washington, D.C., becomes the center of gravity for artificial intelligence. NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C., lands at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center Oct. 27-29 — and for those who care about where computing is headed, this is the moment to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline act: NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote address on Tuesday, Oct. 28, at 12 p.m. ET. Expect more than product news — expect a roadmap for how AI will reshape industries, infrastructure and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, the pregame show kicks off at 8:30 a.m. ET with Brad Gerstner, Patrick Moorhead and Kristina Partsinevelos offering sharp takes on what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But GTC offers more than a keynote. It provides full immersion: 70+ sessions, hands-on workshops and demos covering everything from agentic AI and robotics to quantum computing and AI-native telecom networks. It’s where developers meet decision-makers, and ideas turn into action. Exhibits-only passes are still available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new face for its AI, and its name is Mico. The company announced the new, animated blob-like avatar for Copilot’s voice mode yesterday as part of a “human-centered” rebranding of Microsoft’s Copilot AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mico is part of a Microsoft program dedicated to the idea that “technology should work in service of people,” Microsoft wrote. The company insists this effort is “not [about] chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mico has drawn instant and obvious comparisons to Clippy, the animated paperclip that popped up to offer help with Microsoft Office starting in the ’90s. Microsoft has leaned into this comparison with an Easter egg that can transform Mico into an animated Clippy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clippy walked so that we could run,” Microsoft AI Corporate VP Jacob Andreou joked in an interview with The Verge. “We all live in Clippy’s shadow in some sense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Clippy was an attempt to strengthen our connection to sterile Windows Help menus, Mico seems focused more on strengthening the parasocial relationships many people are already developing with LLMs. The defining interaction with Clippy was along the lines of “It looks like you’re writing a letter, would you like some help?” With Mico, the idea seems to be “It looks like you’re trying to find a friend.

Through repeated exposure, members of the audience can come to feel like they know the celebrity as a friend, even if the celebrity doesn’t know them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mass media like radio, movies, and television can all feed into parasocial relationships, the Internet and smartphone revolutions have supercharged the opportunities we all have to feel like an online stranger is a close, personal confidante. From YouTube and podcast personalities to Instagram influencers or even your favorite blogger/journalist (hi), it’s easy to feel like you have a close connection with the people who create the content you see online every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      After spending hours watching this TikTok personality, I trust her implicitly to sell me a purse.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing all this content on a smartphone can flatten all these media and real-life personalities into a kind of undifferentiated media sludge. It can be all too easy to slot an audio message from your romantic partner into the same mental box as a stranger chatting about video games in a podcast. “When my phone does little mating calls of pings and buzzes, it could bring me updates from people I love, or show me alerts I never asked for from corporations hungry for my attention,” Julie Beck writes in an excellent Atlantic article about this phenomenon. “Picking my loved ones out of the never-ending stream of stuff on my phone requires extra effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the world Mico seems to be trying to slide into, turning Copilot into another not-quite-real relationship mediated through your mobile device. But unlike the Instagram model who never seems to acknowledge your comments, Mico is always there to respond with a friendly smile and a warm, soothing voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI that “earns your trust”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text-based AI interfaces are already frighteningly good at faking human personality in a way that encourages this kind of parasocial relationship, sometimes with disastrous results. But adding a friendly, Pixar-like face to Copilot’s voice mode may make it much easier to be sucked into feeling like Copilot isn’t just a neural network but a real, caring personality—one you might even start thinking of the same way you’d think of the real loved ones in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      You can trust me… don’t I have an honest face?

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;Microsoft even admits that this is the point on some level. Twice in its “human-centered AI” announcement, the company talks about wanting to build an AI that “earns your trust.” Mico in particular “shows up with warmth [and] personality” by “react[ing] like someone who truly listens,” making “voice conversations feel more natural… [and] creating a friendly and engaging experience.” In his Verge interview, Andreou said that with Mico, “all the technology fades into the background, and you just start talking to this cute orb and build this connection with it.”
&lt;p&gt;That sounds less like technology focused on “deepen[ing] human connection” and more like the kind of technology that’s about “chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time.” After all, an AI that’s easier to talk to is an AI you’ll want to talk to more—and potentially pay more to access. If an AI chatbot with a warm, friendly face “earns your trust,” you’re a lot less likely to listen to the AI skeptics that generate what Microsoft calls “a lot of noise around AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Say what you want about Clippy, but a text-based Help menu can’t do any of this.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if Mico will end up being a beloved parasocial friend to millions of Copilot users or more of an ironically remembered annoyance like Clippy. But it won’t be the last attempt to put a cute, trustworthy face on large language models that don’t necessarily merit that level of trust. And we should all be wary of the parasocial psychology these efforts can feed into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mass media like radio, movies, and television can all feed into parasocial relationships, the Internet and smartphone revolutions have supercharged the opportunities we all have to feel like an online stranger is a close, personal confidante. From YouTube and podcast personalities to Instagram influencers or even your favorite blogger/journalist (hi), it’s easy to feel like you have a close connection with the people who create the content you see online every day.&lt;/p&gt;

      After spending hours watching this TikTok personality, I trust her implicitly to sell me a purse.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing all this content on a smartphone can flatten all these media and real-life personalities into a kind of undifferentiated media sludge. It can be all too easy to slot an audio message from your romantic partner into the same mental box as a stranger chatting about video games in a podcast. “When my phone does little mating calls of pings and buzzes, it could bring me updates from people I love, or show me alerts I never asked for from corporations hungry for my attention,” Julie Beck writes in an excellent Atlantic article about this phenomenon. “Picking my loved ones out of the never-ending stream of stuff on my phone requires extra effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the world Mico seems to be trying to slide into, turning Copilot into another not-quite-real relationship mediated through your mobile device. But unlike the Instagram model who never seems to acknowledge your comments, Mico is always there to respond with a friendly smile and a warm, soothing voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI that “earns your trust”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text-based AI interfaces are already frighteningly good at faking human personality in a way that encourages this kind of parasocial relationship, sometimes with disastrous results. But adding a friendly, Pixar-like face to Copilot’s voice mode may make it much easier to be sucked into feeling like Copilot isn’t just a neural network but a real, caring personality—one you might even start thinking of the same way you’d think of the real loved ones in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      You can trust me… don’t I have an honest face?

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;Microsoft even admits that this is the point on some level. Twice in its “human-centered AI” announcement, the company talks about wanting to build an AI that “earns your trust.” Mico in particular “shows up with warmth [and] personality” by “react[ing] like someone who truly listens,” making “voice conversations feel more natural… [and] creating a friendly and engaging experience.” In his Verge interview, Andreou said that with Mico, “all the technology fades into the background, and you just start talking to this cute orb and build this connection with it.”
&lt;p&gt;That sounds less like technology focused on “deepen[ing] human connection” and more like the kind of technology that’s about “chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time.” After all, an AI that’s easier to talk to is an AI you’ll want to talk to more—and potentially pay more to access. If an AI chatbot with a warm, friendly face “earns your trust,” you’re a lot less likely to listen to the AI skeptics that generate what Microsoft calls “a lot of noise around AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Say what you want about Clippy, but a text-based Help menu can’t do any of this.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if Mico will end up being a beloved parasocial friend to millions of Copilot users or more of an ironically remembered annoyance like Clippy. But it won’t be the last attempt to put a cute, trustworthy face on large language models that don’t necessarily merit that level of trust. And we should all be wary of the parasocial psychology these efforts can feed into.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;blockquote class="xfBb-quote"&gt;The company insists this effort is “not [about] chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;So will Microsoft consider Mico to be a success if it drives people away from the computer and back into real life to build human connections in meatspace? Or would that be considered a disaster due to declining engagement and screen time metrics?
