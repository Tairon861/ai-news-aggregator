Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived over the weekend, developed from an embryo that was frozen in storage for 30 and a half years. You could call him the world’s oldest baby.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His parents, Lindsey and Tim Pierce, were themselves only young children when that embryo was created, all the way back in 1994.&lt;/strong&gt; Linda Archerd, who donated the embryo, described the experience as “surreal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stories like this also highlight how reproductive technologies are shaping families. Thaddeus already has a 30-year-old sister and a 10-year-old niece. Lindsey and Tim are his birth parents, but his genes came from two other people who divorced decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And while baby Thaddeus is a record-breaker, plenty of other babies have been born from embryos that have been frozen for significant spells of time.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Thaddeus has taken the title of “world’s oldest baby” from the previous record-holders: twins Lydia Ann and Timothy Ronald Ridgeway, born in 2022, who developed from embryos that were created 30 years earlier, in 1992. Before that, the title was held by Molly Gibson, who developed from an embryo that was in storage for 27 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These remarkable stories suggest there may be no limit to how long embryos can be stored. &lt;/strong&gt;Even after more than 30 years of being frozen at -196 °C (-321 °F), these tiny cells can be reanimated and develop into healthy babies. (Proponents of cryogenics can only &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; of achieving anything like this with grown people.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These stories also serve as a reminder that thanks to advances in cryopreservation and the ever-increasing popularity of IVF, a growing number of embryos are being stored in tanks. No one knows for sure how many there are, but there are millions of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all of them will be used in IVF.&lt;/strong&gt; There are plenty of reasons why someone who created embryos might never use them. Archerd says that while she had always planned to use all four of the embryos she created with her then husband, he didn’t want a bigger family. Some couples create embryos and then separate. Some people “age out” of being able to use their embryos themselves—many clinics refuse to transfer an embryo to people in their late 40s or older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What then? In most cases, people who have embryos they won’t use can choose to donate them, either to potential parents or for research, or discard them. Donation to other parents&amp;nbsp;tends to be the least popular option. (In some countries, none of those options are available, and unused embryos end up in a strange limbo—you can read more about that&amp;nbsp;here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But some people, like Archerd, do donate their embryos. The recipients of those embryos will be the legal parents of the resulting children, but they won’t share a genetic link. The children might not ever meet their genetic “parents.” (Archerd is, however, very keen to meet Thaddeus.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people might have donated their embryos anonymously. But anonymity can never be guaranteed. Nowadays, consumer genetic tests allow anyone to search for family members—even if the people they track down thought they were making an anonymous donation 20 years ago, before these tests even existed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These kinds of tests have already resulted in surprise revelations that have disrupted families.&lt;/strong&gt; People who discover that they were conceived using a donated egg or sperm can find multiple long-lost siblings. One man who spoke at a major reproduction conference in 2024 said that since taking a DNA test,&amp;nbsp;he had found he had 50&amp;nbsp;of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;general advice now is for parents to let their children know how they were conceived relatively early on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I shared the story of baby Thaddeus on social media, a couple of people commented that they had concerns for the child. One person mentioned the age gap between Thaddeus and his 30-year-old sister. That person added that being donor conceived “isn’t easy.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;For the record, that is not what researchers find when they evaluate donor-conceived children and their families. Studies find that embryo donation doesn’t affect parents’ attachment to a child&amp;nbsp;or their parenting style. And&amp;nbsp;donor-conceived children tend to be psychosocially well adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Families come in all shapes and sizes. Reproductive technologies are extending the range of those shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Subscribers to Google’s $250-per-month Ultra subscription will gain access to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini app starting Friday.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First unveiled in May at Google I/O 2025, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think is Google’s first publicly available multi-agent model. These systems spawn AI multiple agents to tackle a question in parallel, a process that uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent, but tends to result in better answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google used a variation of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to score a gold medal at this year’s International Math Olympiad (IMO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, the company says it is releasing the model it used at the IMO to a select group of mathematicians and academics. Google says this AI model “takes hours to reason,” instead of seconds or minutes like most consumer-facing AI models. The company hopes the IMO model will enhance research efforts, and aims to get feedback on how to improve the multi-agent system for academic use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google notes that the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model is a significant improvement over what it announced at I/O. The company also claims to have developed “novel reinforcement learning techniques” to encourage Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to make better use of its reasoning paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Deep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step,” said Google in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) — a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions across math, humanities, and science. Google claims its model scored 34.8% on HLE (without tools), compared to xAI’s Grok 4, which scored 25.4%, and OpenAI’s o3, which scored 20.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperforms AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench6, a challenging test of competitive coding tasks. Google’s model scored 87.6%, whereas Grok 4 scored 79%, and OpenAI’s o3 scored 72%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3033173" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image.png?w=580" width="580" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Benchmark scores. Image Credits: Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini 2.5 Deep Think automatically works with tools such as code execution and Google Search, and the company says it’s capable of producing “much longer responses” than traditional AI models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In Google’s testing, the model produced more detailed and aesthetically pleasing web development tasks compared to other AI models. The company claims the model could aid researchers and “potentially accelerate the path to discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3033177" height="442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-5.31.36PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Art scenes made by Google’s AI (Credit: Google)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It seems that several leading AI labs are converging around the multi-agent approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s xAI recently released a multi-agent system of its own, Grok 4 Heavy, which it says was able to achieve industry leading performance on several benchmarks. OpenAI researcher Noam Brown said on a podcast that the unreleased AI model the company used to achieve a gold medal at this year’s International Math Olympiad (IMO) was also a multi-agent system. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s Research agent, which generates thorough research briefs, is also powered by a multi-agent system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the strong performance, it seems that multi-agent systems are even costlier to serve than traditional AI models. That means tech companies may keep these systems gated behind their most expensive subscription plans, which xAI and now Google have chosen to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the coming weeks, Google says it plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a select group of testers via the Gemini API. The company says it wants to better understand how developers and enterprises may use its multi-agent system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google DeepMind is rolling out Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, which, the company says, is its most advanced AI reasoning model, able to answer questions by exploring and considering multiple ideas simultaneously and then using those outputs to choose the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re making Deep Think available in the Gemini app to Google AI Ultra subscribers – the latest in a lineup of extremely capable AI tools and features made exclusively available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new release incorporates feedback from early trusted testers and research breakthroughs. It’s a significant improvement over what was first announced at I/O, as measured in terms of key benchmark improvements and trusted tester feedback. It is a variation of the model that recently achieved the gold-medal standard at this year’s International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). While that model takes hours to reason about complex math problems, today’s release is faster and more usable day-to-day, while still reaching Bronze-level performance on the 2025 IMO benchmark, based on internal evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Think could be a powerful tool in creative problem solving:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we put Deep Think in the hands of Google AI Ultra subscribers, we’re also sharing the official version of the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model that achieved the gold-medal standard with a small group of mathematicians and academics. We look forward to hearing how it could enhance their research and inquiry, and we’ll use their feedback as we continue to improve this offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release represents a significant step forward in our mission to build more helpful and capable AI, and furthers our commitment to using Gemini to push the frontier of human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Deep Think works: extending Gemini’s parallel “thinking time”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as people tackle complex problems by taking the time to explore different angles, weigh potential solutions, and refine a final answer, Deep Think pushes the frontier of thinking capabilities by using parallel thinking techniques. This approach lets Gemini generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously, even revising or combining different ideas over time, before arriving at the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by extending the inference time or "thinking time," we give Gemini more time to explore different hypotheses, and arrive at creative solutions to complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also developed novel reinforcement learning techniques that encourage the model to make use of these extended reasoning paths, thus enabling Deep Think to become a better, more intuitive problem-solver over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Deep Think stacks up: state-of-the-art performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iterative development and design:&lt;/b&gt; We’ve been impressed by Deep Think’s performance on tasks that require building something complex, piece by piece. For example, we’ve observed Deep Think can improve both the aesthetics and functionality of web development tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientific and mathematical discovery:&lt;/b&gt; Because it can reason through highly complex problems, Deep Think can be a powerful tool for researchers. It can help formulate and explore mathematical conjectures or reason through complex scientific literature, potentially accelerating the path to discovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Algorithmic development and code:&lt;/b&gt; Deep Think particularly excels at tough coding problems in which problem formulation and careful consideration of tradeoffs and time complexity is paramount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Think’s performance is also reflected in challenging benchmarks that measure coding, science, knowledge and reasoning capabilities. For example, compared to other models without tool use, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves state-of-the-art performance across LiveCodeBench V6, which measures competitive code performance, and Humanity’s Last Exam, a challenging benchmark that measures expertise in different domains, including science and math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In testing, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think demonstrated improved content safety and tone-objectivity compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, but did have a higher tendency to refuse benign requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gemini's problem-solving abilities advance, we are taking a deeper look at risks that come with increased complexity, including our frontier safety evaluations and the implementation of planned mitigations for critical capability levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details on the safety outcomes of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think are available in the model card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Deep Think automatically works with tools such as code execution and Google Search, and can produce much longer responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also working to release Deep Think with and without tools to a set of trusted testers via the Gemini API in the coming weeks, to better understand its usability for developer and enterprise use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams at nearly every layer of the stack, from research to deployment, have worked to make Deep Think faster, more reliable, and user friendly for Gemini app users.

At the centre of it all are screenshots showing a series of model repositories with names like yofo-deepcurrent/gpt-oss-120b and yofo-wildflower/gpt-oss-20b. The repos have since been deleted, but the accounts feature OpenAI team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gpt-oss tag is the real smoking gun, seemingly a clear signpost for ‘GPT Open Source Software’. For a company that has increasingly guarded its top-tier models, this would be somewhat of a return to its roots. The fact that we are seeing multiple versions, with different codenames and sizes, suggests a well-planned family of models are about to make their debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of alleged leaked repos for OpenAI's open-source AI model that is set for imminent launch." class="wp-image-107267" height="1024" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/openai-open-source-ai-model-open-source-artificial-intelligence-leak-gpt-679x1024.jpeg" width="679" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a leaked configuration file, we can even peek under the bonnet of the suspected 120 billion parameter version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model appears to be built on a Mixture of Experts, or MoE, architecture. Think of it less like a single, monolithic brain trying to know everything, and more like a board of 128 specialist advisors. When a query comes in, the system intelligently selects the four best experts for the job. This gives the model the vast knowledge of its huge parameter count, but the speed and agility of a much smaller system, as only a fraction of it is working at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design puts OpenAI’s open-source AI model squarely in competition with the darlings of the scene, like Mistral AI’s Mixtral and Meta’s Llama family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the specs don’t stop there. OpenAI’s open-source AI model appears to boast a huge vocabulary, which should make it more efficient with a wider range of languages, and uses Sliding Window Attention to handle long streams of text without breaking a sweat. In practice, this all points to a model that is both powerful and practical to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why would OpenAI make such a move now? For years, the company has faced gentle jabs and outright criticism for straying from its more open beginnings. Launching a powerful gpt-oss would be a massive charm offensive aimed directly at the developers and researchers who felt left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s also a shrewd competitive play. Meta and Mistral have shown how a thriving open-source ecosystem can drive innovation. By dropping a powerful open-source AI model like this appears to be into the mix, OpenAI isn’t just joining the race; it’s attempting to redefine the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we get the official word from OpenAI, this is all still, technically, rumour. But it’s a rumour with substance, backed by code and configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of a high-performance, 120-billion-parameter open-source MoE model from the most famous name in AI would be nothing short of a landmark event, and it appears to be imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Mariia Shalabaieva)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zuckerberg outlines Meta’s AI vision for ‘personal superintelligence’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-11874" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

At the centre of it all are screenshots showing a series of model repositories with names like yofo-deepcurrent/gpt-oss-120b and yofo-wildflower/gpt-oss-20b. The repos have since been deleted, but the accounts feature OpenAI team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gpt-oss tag is the real smoking gun, seemingly a clear signpost for ‘GPT Open Source Software’. For a company that has increasingly guarded its top-tier models, this would be somewhat of a return to its roots. The fact that we are seeing multiple versions, with different codenames and sizes, suggests a well-planned family of models are about to make their debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of alleged leaked repos for OpenAI's open-source AI model that is set for imminent launch." class="wp-image-107267" height="1024" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/openai-open-source-ai-model-open-source-artificial-intelligence-leak-gpt-679x1024.jpeg" width="679" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a leaked configuration file, we can even peek under the bonnet of the suspected 120 billion parameter version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model appears to be built on a Mixture of Experts, or MoE, architecture. Think of it less like a single, monolithic brain trying to know everything, and more like a board of 128 specialist advisors. When a query comes in, the system intelligently selects the four best experts for the job. This gives the model the vast knowledge of its huge parameter count, but the speed and agility of a much smaller system, as only a fraction of it is working at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design puts OpenAI’s open-source AI model squarely in competition with the darlings of the scene, like Mistral AI’s Mixtral and Meta’s Llama family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the specs don’t stop there. OpenAI’s open-source AI model appears to boast a huge vocabulary, which should make it more efficient with a wider range of languages, and uses Sliding Window Attention to handle long streams of text without breaking a sweat. In practice, this all points to a model that is both powerful and practical to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why would OpenAI make such a move now? For years, the company has faced gentle jabs and outright criticism for straying from its more open beginnings. Launching a powerful gpt-oss would be a massive charm offensive aimed directly at the developers and researchers who felt left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s also a shrewd competitive play. Meta and Mistral have shown how a thriving open-source ecosystem can drive innovation.
