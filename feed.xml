Today, it’s one of the first. The rise of generative AI has shifted how small businesses imagine, launch, and grow — turning what used to be a months-long creative process into something interactive, iterative, and accessible from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search data tells the story. Since 2022, global interest in “AI business name generator” has surged more than 700%. Searches for “AI logo generator” are up 1,200%, and “AI website generator” 1,600%. Small businesses aren’t waiting for enterprise AI trickle-down. They’re adopting these tools en masse to move faster from concept to brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The appetite for AI-powered design has been extraordinary,” says Alec Lynch, founder and CEO of Design.com. “Entrepreneurs are realizing they can bring their ideas to life immediately — they don’t have to wait for funding, agencies, or a full creative team. They can start now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The democratization of design power&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, small businesses were boxed out of high-end design. Building a brand required deep pockets and specialized talent. AI has redrawn that map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models and image generators now act as collaborative partners — sparking ideas, testing directions, and handling tedious layout and copy work. For founders, that means fewer barriers and faster iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of hiring separate agencies for naming, logo design, and web development, small businesses are turning to unified AI platforms that handle the full early-stage design stack. Tools like Design.com merge naming, logo creation, and website generation into a single workflow — turning an entrepreneur’s first sketch into a polished brand system within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI isn’t replacing creativity,” Lynch adds. “It’s giving people the confidence to express it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The five frontiers of AI-powered entrepreneurship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s AI tools mirror the creative journey every founder takes — from naming a business to sharing it with the world. The five fastest-growing design categories on Google reflect each stage of that journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Naming: From idea to identity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI naming tools do more than spit out clever words — they help founders discover their voice. A good generator blends tone, personality, and domain availability so the result feels like a fit, not a random suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Logos: From visuals to meaning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logo creation is one of the most emotionally resonant steps in brand-building. AI has turned it into a playground for experimentation. Entrepreneurs can test dozens of looks and get instant feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Websites: From static pages to adaptive brands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in “AI website generator” searches signals a deeper shift. Websites are no longer static brochures; they’re dynamic brand environments. AI-driven builders now create layouts, headlines, and imagery that adapt to a company’s tone and focus — drastically reducing time to launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Business cards and brand collateral&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in a digital age, tangible touchpoints matter. AI-generated business cards give founders an immediate sense of legitimacy while ensuring design consistency across brand assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Presentations: From slides to storytelling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founders aren’t just designing assets; they’re designing narratives. Generative AI turns bullet points into persuasive visual stories — raising the quality of pitches, decks, and demos once out of reach for most small teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these five frontiers show that small businesses aren’t just using AI to look more polished — they’re using it to think more strategically about brand, story, and customer experience from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The new design ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the surge in AI design tools lies a broader ecosystem shift. Companies like Canva and Wix made design accessible; the current wave — led by AI-native platforms like Design.com — is more personal and adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike templated platforms, these tools understand context. A restaurant founder and a SaaS startup will get not just different visuals, but different copy tones, typography systems, and user flows — automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing,” Lynch explains, “isn’t just growth in one product category. It’s a movement toward connected creativity — where every part of the brand experience learns from every other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From AI tools to AI brand systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next evolution of small-business design won’t be about single-purpose tools. It will be about connected systems that share data, context, and creative intent across every brand touchpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine naming a company and watching an AI instantly generate a logo, color palette, and homepage layout that all reflect the same personality. As your audience grows, the same system helps you update your visual identity or tone to match new goals — while preserving your original DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the future Design.com and others are building toward: intelligent brand ecosystems that evolve alongside their founders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI design tools are giving small businesses superpowers,” Lynch says. “They’re removing friction from creativity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that frictionless design process is quietly rewriting what entrepreneurship looks like. The ability to create, iterate, and launch in hours instead of months is changing the tempo of business itself — and redefining what it means to be a designer in the age of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

But beneath the headline-grabbing sell-out and subsequent controversy lies a more significant story: the enterprise implications of operating-system-level AI agents that can autonomously execute complex, multi-step tasks in device ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ZTE Nubia M153, powered by ByteDance’s Doubao large language model, represents both a consumer gadget experiment and a preview of how agentic AI smartphones could reshape workplace productivity, field operations, and enterprise mobility strategies – if the technology can overcome fundamental trust and governance challenges that enterprise adoption demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From consumer curiosity to enterprise necessity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer appeal is obvious: voice-activated restaurant bookings, automatic photo editing, cross-platform price comparisons. But, according to Gartner projections, by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI capabilities, up from less than 1% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smartphone, as the most ubiquitous computing device in enterprise workflows, becomes a important testing ground. “Agentic AI in industries like manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and energy will enhance decisions, boost safety, and streamline tasks,” says Nicholas Muy, CISO of Scrut Automation. However, he cautions that early adopters must navigate real risks around AI errors and security gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey’s research indicates 23% of organisations are scaling agentic AI systems in at least one business function, with an additional 39% experimenting with AI agents. However, enterprise adoption differs from consumer use: it needs governance frameworks, audit trails, role-based permissions, and compliance mechanisms that ByteDance’s consumer-focused prototype notably lacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;China’s strategic advantage in software-hardware integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s approach – partnering with ZTE rather than building proprietary hardware – mirrors successful enterprise AI strategies. The company positions Doubao as a system-level integration that any manufacturer can adopt, similar to how Google used Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 157 million monthly active users as of August 2025, according to data from QuestMobile, Doubao already dominates China’s consumer AI market, more than doubling Tencent’s Yuanbao with73 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software-over-hardware strategy addresses what Morgan Stanley analysts identifies as a important weakness: major smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi, possess strong enough technology capabilities to self-develop AI assistants rather than partnering with third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s realistic target market appears to be second-tier manufacturers and, potentially, enterprise device management platforms seeking differentiated capabilities. For enterprise buyers, this fragmentation presents both opportunity and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations can select device manufacturers based on hardware requirements while standardising on AI capabilities – but only if governance and security frameworks prove robust enough for regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The privacy panic that revealed enterprise requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The swift backlash following entrepreneur Taylor Ogan’s viral demos on social media of the M153’s capabilities, which illuminated what enterprise adoption demands. When users witnessed an AI agent with deep system privileges autonomously accessing apps, processing payments, and manipulating data, the immediate concern wasn’t convenience – it was control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Forum Ventures survey of 100 senior enterprise IT decision-makers, trust remains the primary adoption barrier. “The trust gap is enormous,” says Jonah Midanik, General Partner at Forum Ventures. “While AI agents can perform tasks with remarkable efficiency, their outputs are based on statistical probabilities rather than inherent truths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s reported rollback of capabilities demonstrates an understanding that enterprise-grade agentic AI smartphones require granular permission systems, comprehensive logging, and the ability to define strict operational boundaries – features notably absent from the consumer prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise vs. consumer: Different use cases, different requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise uses for agentic AI smartphones diverge sharply from consumer applications. Field service technicians could use AI agents that proactively surface equipment histories, recommend optimal routes based on real-time conditions, and guide complex procedures without manual searches. Healthcare providers could access patient context and decision support without navigating multiple systems. Financial services professionals could receive compliance-checked recommendations and automated workflow orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PwC research, 79% of organisations have implemented AI agents at some level, with 96% of IT leaders planning expansions in 2025. However, Cloudera’s survey of 1,484 IT decision-makers revealed that successful enterprise deployment requires industry-specific data integration, transparent decision-making processes, and phased rollouts with comprehensive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer smartphone market, projected by IDC to ship 912 million generative AI-enabled units by 2028, emphasises personalisation and convenience. Enterprise deployments prioritise auditability, compliance, and risk mitigation – requirements that consumer-focused agentic AI smartphones haven’t yet addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Global competitive dynamics and regional strategies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US-China technology divide adds complexity. Apple’s delayed Apple Intelligence rollout in mainland China created an opening that ByteDance, Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are competing to fill. However, Apple’s approach differs fundamentally: tight hardware-software integration with on-device processing prioritises user privacy – a stance that resonates with enterprise security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s licensing strategy positions Doubao for rapid market penetration in Chinese manufacturers, potentially establishing de facto standards before Western competitors can match operating-system-level integration. For multinational enterprises operating in regions, this creates device management challenges around data sovereignty, compliance frameworks, and consistent user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Counterpoint Research, Asia-Pacific represents the fastest-growing market for AI agents, with the US currently holding 40.1% revenue share. Enterprise buyers must navigate a bifurcated landscape, potentially maintaining separate device strategies for different regulatory environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The path forward: Solutions over hype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders evaluating agentic AI smartphones, ByteDance’s prototype offers valuable lessons in what to demand from vendors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, comprehensive governance frameworks that define decision boundaries, log all autonomous actions, and provide role-based access controls. Anthropic’s enterprise solution, which features centralised provisioning, audit logs, and role-based granting of permissions, may demonstrate those requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, hybrid approaches that balance on-device processing for sensitive operations with cloud capabilities for complex reasoning. Enterprise deployments require flexibility to meet varying data residency and compliance requirements in jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, phased rollouts starting with low-risk use cases. Amazon’s deployment of AI agents for Java application modernisation illustrates how enterprises can capture value while managing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ByteDance-ZTE collaboration ultimately previews an inevitable convergence: agentic AI capabilities will become standard smartphone features, not premium differentiators. Enterprise adoption will follow proven patterns – pilot programmes in controlled environments, security validation, and gradual expansion as governance frameworks mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question facing enterprise technology leaders isn’t whether agentic AI smartphones will affect workplace productivity, but whether they’ll shape deployment strategies proactively or react to consumer technologies retrofitted with enterprise features. The privacy panic that followed ByteDance’s launch suggests that organisations demanding enterprise-grade security and governance from the outset will define the technology’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gartner projects that at least 15% of work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, compared with none in 2024, the smartphone becomes a communication device and an autonomous enterprise agent. The winners won’t be those who deploy fastest, but those who deploy most thoughtfully – with security and scalable governance built in from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: IBM cites agentic AI, data policies, and quantum as 2026 trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111182" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The winners won’t be those who deploy fastest, but those who deploy most thoughtfully – with security and scalable governance built in from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: IBM cites agentic AI, data policies, and quantum as 2026 trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111182" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This group exercise is mostly fun and always engrossing, but at times it can also be quite difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We collectively pitch dozens of ideas, and the editors meticulously review and debate the merits of each. We agonize over which ones might make the broadest impact, whether one is too similar to something we’ve featured in the past, and how confident we are that a recent advance will actually translate into long-term success. There is plenty of lively discussion along the way.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2026 list will come out on January 12—so stay tuned. In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the technologies from this year’s reject pile, as a window into our decision-making process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These four technologies &lt;em&gt;won’t &lt;/em&gt;be on our 2026 list of breakthroughs, but all were closely considered, and we think they’re worth knowing about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Male contraceptives&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are several new treatments in the pipeline for men who are sexually active and wish to prevent pregnancy—potentially providing them with an alternative to condoms or vasectomies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two of those treatments are now being tested in clinical trials by a company called Contraline. One is a gel that men would rub on their shoulder or upper arm once a day to suppress sperm production, and the other is a device designed to block sperm during ejaculation. (Kevin Eisenfrats, Contraline’s CEO, was recently named to our Innovators Under 35 list). A once-a-day pill is also in early-stage trials with the firm YourChoice Therapeutics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Though it’s exciting to see this progress, it will still take several years for any of these treatments to make their way through clinical trials—assuming all goes well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World models&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;World models have become the hot new thing in AI in recent months. Though they’re difficult to define, these models are generally trained on videos or spatial data and aim to produce 3D virtual worlds from simple prompts. They reflect fundamental principles, like gravity, that govern our actual world. The results could be used in game design or to make robots more capable by helping them understand their physical surroundings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite some disagreements on exactly what constitutes a world model, the idea is certainly gaining momentum. Renowned AI researchers including Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li have launched companies to develop them, and Li’s startup World Labs released its first version last month. And Google made a huge splash with the release of its Genie 3 world model earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though these models are shaping up to be an exciting new frontier for AI in the year ahead, it seemed premature to deem them a breakthrough. But definitely watch this space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of personhood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to AI, it’s getting harder to know who and what is real online. It’s now possible to make hyperrealistic digital avatars of yourself or someone you know based on very little training data, using equipment many people have at home. And AI agents are being set loose across the internet to take action on people’s behalf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this is creating more interest in what are known as personhood credentials, which could offer a way to verify that you are, in fact, a real human when you do something important online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve reported on efforts by OpenAI, Microsoft, Harvard, and MIT to create a digital token that would serve this purpose. To get it, you’d first go to a government office or other organization and show identification. Then it’d be installed on your device and whenever you wanted to, say, log into your bank account, cryptographic protocols would verify that the token was authentic—confirming that you are the person you claim to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this particular approach catches on, many of us in the newsroom agree that the future internet will need something along these lines. Right now, though, many competing identity verification projects are in various stages of development. One is World ID by Sam Altman’s startup Tools for Humanity, which uses a twist on biometrics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;If these efforts reach critical mass—or if one emerges as the clear winner, perhaps by becoming a universal standard or being integrated into a major platform—we’ll know it’s time to revisit the idea.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world’s oldest baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July, senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou broke the news of a record-setting baby. The infant developed from an embryo that had been sitting in storage for more than 30 years, earning him the bizarre honorific of “oldest baby.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This odd new record was made possible in part by advances in IVF, including safer methods of thawing frozen embryos. But perhaps the greater enabler has been the rise of “embryo adoption” agencies that pair donors with hopeful parents. People who work with these agencies are sometimes more willing to make use of decades-old embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This practice could help find a home for some of the millions of leftover embryos that remain frozen in storage banks today. But since this recent achievement was brought about by changing norms as much as by any sudden technological improvements, this record didn’t quite meet our definition of a breakthrough—though it’s impressive nonetheless.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/benched.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a longtime reader, you probably know that our newsroom selects 10 breakthroughs every year that we think will define the future.

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased energy usage, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073657" height="269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —&amp;nbsp; jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073656" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;The gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily.

OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073656" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;The gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK doctors’ surgeries deploying AI in patient care (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/medical-ai-in-the-uk-doctors-clinicians-surgeries-and-general-administrative-workloads/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;InTouchNow.ai is now offering doctors surgeries a piece of software designed to modernise phone answering, designed to reduce hold times and create a smoother, more responsive experience for patients and staff. In the UK, many GP (general practice) surgeries’ phone lines are tied up in the mornings as patients try to contact their medical practitioner for appointments. More acute need can be delayed among calls with routine enquiries, meaning high-priority callers can be left waiting for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses voice-based AI to handle calls, schedule appointments, and assess patient needs, and is capable of handling many calls simultaneously, channelling callers with appointment requests, those seeking general advice, prescription requests, and seeking results of clinical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded by Daniel Park, InTouchNow.ai draws on his 30+ years of experience in medical call centres. The AI receptionist answers calls quickly, and can automatically update integrated appointment systems. Practices can record a voice messages to personalise the experience for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits for practices include reducing the numbers of missed calls, decreased workload for reception staff, and improved access by patients to medical services. Being entirely software-based, the system operates outside regular hours, which can reduce the need for staff overtime at times of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system integrates with common GP software like Surgery Connect, AWS, and Anima, automating tasks and maintaining patient data security while giving practices full control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology supports over 200 languages, with options for different dialects and accents, an aspect that will help patients in multi-cultural areas like inner-cities. Several practices in the UK are already using InTouchNow.ai and have reported positive results in call handling and patient access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much under-funded National Health Service in the UK has been quick to deploy AI-powered software to reduce its operating costs, often targeting the reduction of staff administration costs to funnel funds into patient care. For example, Smart Triage is an AI-powered system deployed in UK GP practices that can triage patients making initial enquiries, and based on their responses, book them into the right care pathway, such as GP or nurse appointment, or referral to specialist clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An evaluation of Smart Triage at a Surrey GP practice in 2024 showed the platform reduced the average patient waiting time by 73%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, especially GPs, iatroX is a UK-based AI clinical reference platform that helps doctors retrieve evidence-based clinical guidance, and summarising relevant literature &amp;amp; guidelines. Doctors in general practice are expected to be able to assess a full range of patients’ needs, and such platforms help clinicians identify the cause of uncommon symptoms when GPs might lack specialist knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An evaluation in 2025 found a majority of surveyed users stating iatroX was useful (~86%) or reliable (~79%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As documented by NHS England, AI platforms are used in practice, tackling tasks like diagnosis, the monitoring of chronic disease, provision of prescription advice, and handling general administration tasks that otherwise would take up clinicians’ time. Of all the sectors where sensitive data has to be protected, medicine has one of the highest standards of governance, making the deployment of AI a delicate balance between operational effectiveness and the preservation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Doctor appointment” by Taric25 is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3073301" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Hinge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The company says it’s committed to developing secure and inclusive financial services, particularly as deepfake technologies are becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing use of facial recognition in many sectors has highlighted the issue of algorithmic bias in AI. Research conducted by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) shows many widely used facial recognition algorithms exhibit considerably higher error rates when analysing the faces of women and people of colour, a disparity that stems from a lack of diversity in the training data and the demographics of those building and controlling many mainstream AI platforms. The consequences of biased algorithms can lead to the denial of financial services to large sections of the population, and is seen as a vulnerability in security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NeurIPS Competition was held alongside the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, the well-respected AI conference, and challenged participants to create AI models capable of high performance and fairness covering a range of demographic factors: Gender, age, and skin tone. Ant International’s team beat over 2,100 submissions from 162 teams coming from all over the world. The given task was to accurately detect 1.2 million AI-generated face images which were chosen as properly representative of demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach taken by Ant’s winning AI model combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with a bias-detection mechanism.

The company says it’s committed to developing secure and inclusive financial services, particularly as deepfake technologies are becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing use of facial recognition in many sectors has highlighted the issue of algorithmic bias in AI. Research conducted by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) shows many widely used facial recognition algorithms exhibit considerably higher error rates when analysing the faces of women and people of colour, a disparity that stems from a lack of diversity in the training data and the demographics of those building and controlling many mainstream AI platforms. The consequences of biased algorithms can lead to the denial of financial services to large sections of the population, and is seen as a vulnerability in security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NeurIPS Competition was held alongside the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, the well-respected AI conference, and challenged participants to create AI models capable of high performance and fairness covering a range of demographic factors: Gender, age, and skin tone. Ant International’s team beat over 2,100 submissions from 162 teams coming from all over the world. The given task was to accurately detect 1.2 million AI-generated face images which were chosen as properly representative of demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach taken by Ant’s winning AI model combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with a bias-detection mechanism.

This early experimentation has allowed the company to take a step back and avoid getting swept up in the frantic AI agent hype. Instead, it is taking a disciplined, layered, modular approach to model development: small, travel-specific models for cheap, fast inference; larger large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and understanding; and domain-tuned evaluations built in-house when precision is critical. 

With this hybrid strategy — combined with selective collaboration with OpenAI — Booking.com has seen accuracy double across key retrieval, ranking and customer-interaction tasks.

As Pranav Pathak, Booking.com’s AI product development lead, posed to VentureBeat in a new podcast: “Do you build it very, very specialized and bespoke and then have an army of a hundred agents? Or do you keep it general enough and have five agents that are good at generalized tasks, but then you have to orchestrate a lot around them? That&amp;#x27;s a balance that I think we&amp;#x27;re still trying to figure out, as is the rest of the industry.”

Check out the new &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Pilot&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://beyondthepilot.ubpages.com/"&gt;podcast here&lt;/a&gt;, and continue reading for highlights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Moving from guessing to deep personalization without being ‘creepy’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendation systems are core to Booking.com’s customer-facing platforms; however, traditional recommendation tools have been less about recommendation and more about guessing, Pathak conceded. So, from the start, he and his team vowed to avoid generic tools: As he put it, the price and recommendation should be based on customer context. 

Booking.com’s initial pre-gen AI tooling for intent and topic detection was a small language model, what Pathak described as “the scale and size of BERT.” The model ingested the customer’s inputs around their problem to determine whether it could be solved through self-service or bumped to a human agent. 

“We started with an architecture of ‘you have to call a tool if this is the intent you detect and this is how you&amp;#x27;ve parsed the structure,” Pathak explained. “That was very, very similar to the first few agentic architectures that came out in terms of reason and defining a tool call.” 

His team has since built out that architecture to include an LLM orchestrator that classifies queries, triggers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and calls APIs or smaller, specialized language models. “We&amp;#x27;ve been able to scale that system quite well because it was so close in architecture that, with a few tweaks, we now have a full agentic stack,” said Pathak. 

As a result, Booking.com is seeing a 2X increase in topic detection, which in turn is freeing up human agents’ bandwidth by 1.5 to 1.7X. More topics, even complicated ones previously identified as ‘other’ and requiring escalation, are being automated. 

Ultimately, this supports more self-service, freeing human agents to focus on customers with uniquely-specific problems that the platform doesn’t have a dedicated tool flow for — say, a family that is unable to access its hotel room at 2 a.m. when the front desk is closed. 

That not only “really starts to compound,” but has a direct, long-term impact on customer retention, Pathak noted. “One of the things we&amp;#x27;ve seen is, the better we are at customer service, the more loyal our customers are.”

Another recent rollout is personalized filtering. Booking.com has between 200 and 250 search filters on its website — an unrealistic amount for any human to sift through, Pathak pointed out. So, his team introduced a free text box that users can type into to immediately receive tailored filters. 

“That becomes such an important cue for personalization in terms of what you&amp;#x27;re looking for in your own words rather than a clickstream,” said Pathak. 

In turn, it cues Booking.com into what customers actually want. For instance, hot tubs — when filter personalization first rolled out, jacuzzi’s were one of the most popular requests. That wasn’t even a consideration previously; there wasn’t even a filter. Now that filter is live. 

“I had no idea,” Pathak noted. “I had never searched for a hot tub in my room honestly.”

When it comes to personalization, though, there is a fine line; memory remains complicated, Pathak emphasized. While it’s important to have long-term memories and evolving threads with customers — retaining information like their typical budgets, preferred hotel star ratings or whether they need disability access — it must be on their terms and protective of their privacy. 

Booking.com is extremely mindful with memory, seeking consent so as to not be “creepy” when collecting customer information. 

“Managing memory is much harder than actually building memory,” said Pathak. “The tech is out there, we have the technical chops to build it. We want to make sure we don&amp;#x27;t launch a memory object that doesn&amp;#x27;t respect customer consent, that doesn&amp;#x27;t feel very natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Finding a balance of build versus buy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As agents mature, Booking.com is navigating a central question facing the entire industry: How narrow should agents become? 

Instead of committing to either a swarm of highly specialized agents or a few generalized ones, the company aims for reversible decisions and avoids “one-way doors” that lock its architecture into long-term, costly paths. Pathak’s strategy is: Generalize where possible, specialize where necessary and keep agent design flexible to help ensure resiliency. 

Pathak and his team are “very mindful” of use cases, evaluating where to build more generalized, reusable agents or more task-specific ones. They strive to use the smallest model possible, with the highest level of accuracy and output quality, for each use case. Whatever can be generalized is. 

Latency is another important consideration. When factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations is paramount, his team will use a larger, much slower model; but with search and recommendations, user expectations set speed. (Pathak noted: “No one’s patient.”)

“We would, for example, never use something as heavy as GPT-5 for just topic detection or for entity extraction,” he said. 

Booking.com takes a similarly elastic tack when it comes to monitoring and evaluations: If it&amp;#x27;s general-purpose monitoring that someone else is better at building and has horizontal capability, they’ll buy it. But if it’s instances where brand guidelines must be enforced, they’ll build their own evals. 

Ultimately, Booking.com has leaned into being “super anticipatory,” agile and flexible. “At this point with everything that&amp;#x27;s happening with AI, we are a little bit averse to walking through one way doors,” said Pathak. “We want as many of our decisions to be reversible as possible. We don&amp;#x27;t want to get locked into a decision that we cannot reverse two years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What other builders can learn from Booking.com’s AI journey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booking.com’s AI journey can serve as an important blueprint for other enterprises. 

Looking back, Pathak acknowledged that they started out with a “pretty complicated” tech stack. They’re now in a good place with that, “but we probably could have started something much simpler and seen how customers interacted with it.”

Given that, he offered this valuable advice: If you’re just starting out with LLMs or agents, out-of-the-box APIs will do just fine. “There&amp;#x27;s enough customization with APIs that you can already get a lot of leverage before you decide you want to go do more.” 

On the other hand, if a use case requires customization not available through a standard API call, that makes a case for in-house tools. 

Still, he emphasized: Don&amp;#x27;t start with the complicated stuff. Tackle the “simplest, most painful problem you can find and the simplest, most obvious solution to that.” 

Identify the product market fit, then investigate the ecosystems, he advised — but don’t just rip out old infrastructures because a new use case demands something specific (like moving an entire cloud strategy from AWS to Azure just to use the OpenAI endpoint). 

Ultimately: “Don&amp;#x27;t lock yourself in too early,” Pathak noted. “Don&amp;#x27;t make decisions that are one-way doors until you are very confident that that&amp;#x27;s the solution that you want to go with.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;When many enterprises weren’t even thinking about agentic behaviors or infrastructures, &lt;a href="http://Booking.com"&gt;Booking.com&lt;/a&gt; had already “stumbled” into them with its homegrown conversational recommendation system. 

This early experimentation has allowed the company to take a step back and avoid getting swept up in the frantic AI agent hype. Instead, it is taking a disciplined, layered, modular approach to model development: small, travel-specific models for cheap, fast inference; larger large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and understanding; and domain-tuned evaluations built in-house when precision is critical. 

With this hybrid strategy — combined with selective collaboration with OpenAI — Booking.com has seen accuracy double across key retrieval, ranking and customer-interaction tasks.

As Pranav Pathak, Booking.com’s AI product development lead, posed to VentureBeat in a new podcast: “Do you build it very, very specialized and bespoke and then have an army of a hundred agents? Or do you keep it general enough and have five agents that are good at generalized tasks, but then you have to orchestrate a lot around them? That&amp;#x27;s a balance that I think we&amp;#x27;re still trying to figure out, as is the rest of the industry.”

Check out the new &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Pilot&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://beyondthepilot.ubpages.com/"&gt;podcast here&lt;/a&gt;, and continue reading for highlights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Moving from guessing to deep personalization without being ‘creepy’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendation systems are core to Booking.com’s customer-facing platforms; however, traditional recommendation tools have been less about recommendation and more about guessing, Pathak conceded. So, from the start, he and his team vowed to avoid generic tools: As he put it, the price and recommendation should be based on customer context. 

Booking.com’s initial pre-gen AI tooling for intent and topic detection was a small language model, what Pathak described as “the scale and size of BERT.” The model ingested the customer’s inputs around their problem to determine whether it could be solved through self-service or bumped to a human agent. 

“We started with an architecture of ‘you have to call a tool if this is the intent you detect and this is how you&amp;#x27;ve parsed the structure,” Pathak explained. “That was very, very similar to the first few agentic architectures that came out in terms of reason and defining a tool call.” 

His team has since built out that architecture to include an LLM orchestrator that classifies queries, triggers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and calls APIs or smaller, specialized language models. “We&amp;#x27;ve been able to scale that system quite well because it was so close in architecture that, with a few tweaks, we now have a full agentic stack,” said Pathak. 

As a result, Booking.com is seeing a 2X increase in topic detection, which in turn is freeing up human agents’ bandwidth by 1.5 to 1.7X. More topics, even complicated ones previously identified as ‘other’ and requiring escalation, are being automated. 

Ultimately, this supports more self-service, freeing human agents to focus on customers with uniquely-specific problems that the platform doesn’t have a dedicated tool flow for — say, a family that is unable to access its hotel room at 2 a.m. when the front desk is closed. 

That not only “really starts to compound,” but has a direct, long-term impact on customer retention, Pathak noted. “One of the things we&amp;#x27;ve seen is, the better we are at customer service, the more loyal our customers are.”

Another recent rollout is personalized filtering. Booking.com has between 200 and 250 search filters on its website — an unrealistic amount for any human to sift through, Pathak pointed out. So, his team introduced a free text box that users can type into to immediately receive tailored filters. 

“That becomes such an important cue for personalization in terms of what you&amp;#x27;re looking for in your own words rather than a clickstream,” said Pathak. 

In turn, it cues Booking.com into what customers actually want. For instance, hot tubs — when filter personalization first rolled out, jacuzzi’s were one of the most popular requests. That wasn’t even a consideration previously; there wasn’t even a filter. Now that filter is live. 

“I had no idea,” Pathak noted. “I had never searched for a hot tub in my room honestly.”

When it comes to personalization, though, there is a fine line; memory remains complicated, Pathak emphasized. While it’s important to have long-term memories and evolving threads with customers — retaining information like their typical budgets, preferred hotel star ratings or whether they need disability access — it must be on their terms and protective of their privacy. 

Booking.com is extremely mindful with memory, seeking consent so as to not be “creepy” when collecting customer information. 

“Managing memory is much harder than actually building memory,” said Pathak. “The tech is out there, we have the technical chops to build it. We want to make sure we don&amp;#x27;t launch a memory object that doesn&amp;#x27;t respect customer consent, that doesn&amp;#x27;t feel very natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Finding a balance of build versus buy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As agents mature, Booking.com is navigating a central question facing the entire industry: How narrow should agents become? 

Instead of committing to either a swarm of highly specialized agents or a few generalized ones, the company aims for reversible decisions and avoids “one-way doors” that lock its architecture into long-term, costly paths. Pathak’s strategy is: Generalize where possible, specialize where necessary and keep agent design flexible to help ensure resiliency. 

Pathak and his team are “very mindful” of use cases, evaluating where to build more generalized, reusable agents or more task-specific ones. They strive to use the smallest model possible, with the highest level of accuracy and output quality, for each use case. Whatever can be generalized is. 

Latency is another important consideration. When factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations is paramount, his team will use a larger, much slower model; but with search and recommendations, user expectations set speed. (Pathak noted: “No one’s patient.”)

“We would, for example, never use something as heavy as GPT-5 for just topic detection or for entity extraction,” he said. 

Booking.com takes a similarly elastic tack when it comes to monitoring and evaluations: If it&amp;#x27;s general-purpose monitoring that someone else is better at building and has horizontal capability, they’ll buy it. But if it’s instances where brand guidelines must be enforced, they’ll build their own evals. 

Ultimately, Booking.com has leaned into being “super anticipatory,” agile and flexible. “At this point with everything that&amp;#x27;s happening with AI, we are a little bit averse to walking through one way doors,” said Pathak. “We want as many of our decisions to be reversible as possible. We don&amp;#x27;t want to get locked into a decision that we cannot reverse two years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What other builders can learn from Booking.com’s AI journey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booking.com’s AI journey can serve as an important blueprint for other enterprises. 

Looking back, Pathak acknowledged that they started out with a “pretty complicated” tech stack. They’re now in a good place with that, “but we probably could have started something much simpler and seen how customers interacted with it.”

Given that, he offered this valuable advice: If you’re just starting out with LLMs or agents, out-of-the-box APIs will do just fine. “There&amp;#x27;s enough customization with APIs that you can already get a lot of leverage before you decide you want to go do more.” 

On the other hand, if a use case requires customization not available through a standard API call, that makes a case for in-house tools. 

Still, he emphasized: Don&amp;#x27;t start with the complicated stuff. Tackle the “simplest, most painful problem you can find and the simplest, most obvious solution to that.” 

Identify the product market fit, then investigate the ecosystems, he advised — but don’t just rip out old infrastructures because a new use case demands something specific (like moving an entire cloud strategy from AWS to Azure just to use the OpenAI endpoint).

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,” Trump posted on social media. “You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump said. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS…AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trump’s statement comes days after an effort to preempt states from regulating AI was quashed in the Senate, as Congress couldn’t agree to insert the deeply unpopular proposal into a must-pass defense budget bill.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fast pace of AI development and the lack of general consumer protections from the federal government has led many states to enact their own rules around the technology. California, for example, has the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53, while Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House “AI czar” David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.’s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Silicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states’ regulatory rights say there’s no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trump’s executive order, a draft of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” New York Assembly member Alex Bores, who sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Attempts to block states’ power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a 10-year moratorium on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn’t operate without oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And when Trump’s draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) posted on X: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) posted late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a November X post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Late last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been several deaths by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they’re calling “AI psychosis.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A bipartisan coalition of over 35 state attorneys general warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than 200 state lawmakers have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Historically, AI models could suggest products or generate meal plans, but the execution phase required deep-linking out to a separate application or website, often resulting in cart abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this new deployment, users can interact with the AI for meal planning and have the system build a cart based on local retailer inventory. The differentiator here is the checkout process. By leveraging the Agentic Commerce Protocol, the transaction is processed directly within the chat interface using a credit card flow powered by Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Nick Turley, VP and Head of ChatGPT, the objective is to connect AI suggestions directly to real-world services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the Instacart app directly in ChatGPT, users can go from meal planning to checkout in a single, seamless conversation,” Turley said. “It’s another step toward bringing our vision to life—where AI delivers helpful suggestions and connects directly to real-world services, saving people time and effort in their everyday lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Instacart checkout agentic commerce experience embedded in OpenAI's ChatGPT." class="wp-image-111211" height="442" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpeg" width="828" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration goes deeper than standard API consumption. Instacart served as an early contributor to the OpenAI Operator research preview, providing feedback to ensure the technology could navigate real-world constraints while adhering to established norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “preview” involvement suggests that Instacart’s complex data environment – involving tens of thousands of SKUs and dynamic stock levels – served as a testing ground for OpenAI’s agentic capabilities. Rather than simply adopting the tool, Instacart helped define the parameters of how an AI agent interacts with external fulfilment logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Instacart deployment underscores why structured, real-time data matters when integrating with large language models (LLMs). An AI agent is only as effective as the data it can access; hallucinations in a commercial context – such as selling out-of-stock items – carry financial and reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anirban Kundu, CTO at Instacart, notes that powering shopping inside an AI agent requires technology capable of interpreting highly local and constantly fluctuating inventory. Instacart attempts to mitigate the “hallucination” risk by grounding the AI’s responses in its massive dataset, which covers more than 1.8 billion product instances across 100,000 stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instacart and ChatGPT are redefining what’s possible in AI-powered shopping,” said Kundu. “Built on Agentic Commerce Protocol, this experience brings intelligent, real-time support to one of the most essential parts of daily life: getting groceries to feed your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, we’re creating a seamless and secure way for people to turn simple conversations into real-world action—helping customers go from inspiration to a full cart delivered from the store to their door with ease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dual-adoption-customer-facing-and-internal-efficiency"&gt;Dual adoption: Customer-facing and internal efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the embedded checkout grabs headlines, Instacart’s broader plan involves extensive internal deployment. The company utilises ChatGPT Enterprise to streamline internal workflows, aimed at accelerating the development of customer experiences. Furthermore, they have deployed OpenAI’s Codex to power an internal coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual approach – using AI to sell (Agentic Commerce) and AI to build (Codex) – offers a model for operations. It moves beyond isolated pilots into a holistic stance where generative models drive both revenue and R&amp;amp;D efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployment points to a change in how brands view digital storefronts. Instacart’s approach appears to accept that consumer entry points are fragmenting. Rather than forcing all traffic through a proprietary app, the company is positioning its infrastructure as the backend fulfilment layer for third-party AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has explicitly stated its intention to bridge AI inspiration with real-world fulfilment, acting as a primary partner for major AI players including OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. By embedding its service into these broad-reach platforms, Instacart aims to capture incremental demand that originates outside its native ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implementation-and-availability-of-instacart-in-chatgpt"&gt;Implementation and availability of Instacart in ChatGPT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience is currently active for users on desktop and mobile web platforms, while native mobile availability for iOS and Android applications is rolling out shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access the feature, users must invoke the specific Instacart application within the ChatGPT interface (for example, by prompting “Instacart, can you help me shop for apple pie ingredients?”) and link their accounts. This opt-in mechanism ensures that data sharing is consensual, a requisite governance step for enterprises deploying consumer-facing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration serves as a case study of agentic AI for commerce. For retail and technology execs, the Instacart model demonstrates that the next phase of digital adoption involves preparing API structures and data pipelines to serve “non-human” customers (AI agents) as reliably as human ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus must remain on data accuracy and real-time availability; without these foundations, agentic workflows will fail to deliver return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI: Enterprise users swap AI pilots for deep integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-110949" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-18.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Historically, AI models could suggest products or generate meal plans, but the execution phase required deep-linking out to a separate application or website, often resulting in cart abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this new deployment, users can interact with the AI for meal planning and have the system build a cart based on local retailer inventory. The differentiator here is the checkout process. By leveraging the Agentic Commerce Protocol, the transaction is processed directly within the chat interface using a credit card flow powered by Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Nick Turley, VP and Head of ChatGPT, the objective is to connect AI suggestions directly to real-world services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the Instacart app directly in ChatGPT, users can go from meal planning to checkout in a single, seamless conversation,” Turley said. “It’s another step toward bringing our vision to life—where AI delivers helpful suggestions and connects directly to real-world services, saving people time and effort in their everyday lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Instacart checkout agentic commerce experience embedded in OpenAI's ChatGPT." class="wp-image-111211" height="442" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpeg" width="828" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration goes deeper than standard API consumption. Instacart served as an early contributor to the OpenAI Operator research preview, providing feedback to ensure the technology could navigate real-world constraints while adhering to established norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “preview” involvement suggests that Instacart’s complex data environment – involving tens of thousands of SKUs and dynamic stock levels – served as a testing ground for OpenAI’s agentic capabilities. Rather than simply adopting the tool, Instacart helped define the parameters of how an AI agent interacts with external fulfilment logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Instacart deployment underscores why structured, real-time data matters when integrating with large language models (LLMs). An AI agent is only as effective as the data it can access; hallucinations in a commercial context – such as selling out-of-stock items – carry financial and reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anirban Kundu, CTO at Instacart, notes that powering shopping inside an AI agent requires technology capable of interpreting highly local and constantly fluctuating inventory. Instacart attempts to mitigate the “hallucination” risk by grounding the AI’s responses in its massive dataset, which covers more than 1.8 billion product instances across 100,000 stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instacart and ChatGPT are redefining what’s possible in AI-powered shopping,” said Kundu. “Built on Agentic Commerce Protocol, this experience brings intelligent, real-time support to one of the most essential parts of daily life: getting groceries to feed your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, we’re creating a seamless and secure way for people to turn simple conversations into real-world action—helping customers go from inspiration to a full cart delivered from the store to their door with ease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dual-adoption-customer-facing-and-internal-efficiency"&gt;Dual adoption: Customer-facing and internal efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the embedded checkout grabs headlines, Instacart’s broader plan involves extensive internal deployment. The company utilises ChatGPT Enterprise to streamline internal workflows, aimed at accelerating the development of customer experiences. Furthermore, they have deployed OpenAI’s Codex to power an internal coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual approach – using AI to sell (Agentic Commerce) and AI to build (Codex) – offers a model for operations. It moves beyond isolated pilots into a holistic stance where generative models drive both revenue and R&amp;amp;D efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployment points to a change in how brands view digital storefronts. Instacart’s approach appears to accept that consumer entry points are fragmenting. Rather than forcing all traffic through a proprietary app, the company is positioning its infrastructure as the backend fulfilment layer for third-party AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has explicitly stated its intention to bridge AI inspiration with real-world fulfilment, acting as a primary partner for major AI players including OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. By embedding its service into these broad-reach platforms, Instacart aims to capture incremental demand that originates outside its native ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implementation-and-availability-of-instacart-in-chatgpt"&gt;Implementation and availability of Instacart in ChatGPT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience is currently active for users on desktop and mobile web platforms, while native mobile availability for iOS and Android applications is rolling out shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access the feature, users must invoke the specific Instacart application within the ChatGPT interface (for example, by prompting “Instacart, can you help me shop for apple pie ingredients?”) and link their accounts. This opt-in mechanism ensures that data sharing is consensual, a requisite governance step for enterprises deploying consumer-facing AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration serves as a case study of agentic AI for commerce. For retail and technology execs, the Instacart model demonstrates that the next phase of digital adoption involves preparing API structures and data pipelines to serve “non-human” customers (AI agents) as reliably as human ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus must remain on data accuracy and real-time availability; without these foundations, agentic workflows will fail to deliver return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI: Enterprise users swap AI pilots for deep integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-110949" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-18.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

 &lt;p&gt;Every time I’m asked what’s coming next, I get a Luke Haines song stuck in my head: “Please don’t ask me about the future / I am not a fortune teller.” But here goes. What will things be like in 2030? My answer: same but different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are huge gulfs of opinion when it comes to predicting the near-future impacts of generative AI. In one camp we have the AI Futures Project, a small donation-funded research outfit led by former OpenAI researcher Daniel Kokotajlo. The nonprofit made a big splash back in April with AI 2027, a speculative account of what the world will look like two years from now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The story follows the runaway advances of an AI firm called OpenBrain (any similarities are coincidental, etc.) all the way to a choose-your-own-adventure-style boom or doom ending. Kokotajlo and his coauthors make no bones about their expectation that in the next decade the impact of AI will exceed that of the Industrial Revolution—a 150-year period of economic and social upheaval so great that we still live in the world it wrought.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale we have team Normal Technology: Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor, a pair of Princeton University researchers and coauthors of the book &lt;em&gt;AI Snake Oil&lt;/em&gt;, who push back not only on most of AI 2027’s predictions but, more important, on its foundational worldview. That’s not how technology works, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Advances at the cutting edge may come thick and fast, but change across the wider economy, and society as a whole, moves at human speed. Widespread adoption of new technologies can be slow; acceptance slower. AI will be no different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What should we make of these extremes? ChatGPT came out three years ago last month, but it’s still not clear just how good the latest versions of this tech are at replacing lawyers or software developers or (gulp) journalists. And new updates no longer bring the step changes in capability that they once did.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet this radical technology is so new it would be foolish to write it off so soon. Just think: Nobody even knows exactly how this technology works—let alone what it’s really for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the rate of advance in the core technology slows down, applications of that tech will become the main differentiator between AI firms. (Witness the new browser wars and the chatbot pick-and-mix already on the market.) At the same time, high-end models are becoming cheaper to run and more accessible. Expect this to be where most of the action is: New ways to use existing models will keep them fresh and distract people waiting in line for what comes next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, progress continues beyond LLMs. (Don’t forget—there was AI before ChatGPT, and there will be AI after it too.) Technologies such as reinforcement learning—the powerhouse behind AlphaGo, DeepMind’s board-game-playing AI that beat a Go grand master in 2016—is set to make a comeback. There’s also a lot of buzz around world models, a type of generative AI with a stronger grip on how the physical world fits together than LLMs display.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I agree with team Normal Technology that rapid technological advances do not translate to economic or societal ones straight away. There’s just too much messy human stuff in the middle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But Tim, over to you. I’m curious to hear what your tea leaves are saying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tim Bradshaw and Will Douglas Heaven" class="wp-image-1126832" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT_TR_Newsletter-Episode-06.jpg?w=2731" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;FT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | ADOBE STOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Bradshaw responds&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will, I am more confident than you that the world will look quite different in 2030. In five years’ time, I expect the AI revolution to have proceeded apace. But who gets to benefit from those gains will create a world of AI haves and have-nots.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that the AI bubble will burst sometime before the end of the decade. Whether a venture capital funding shakeout comes in six months or two years (I feel the current frenzy still has some way to run), swathes of AI app developers will disappear overnight. Some will see their work absorbed by the models upon which they depend. Others will learn the hard way that you can’t sell services that cost $1 for 50 cents without a firehose of VC funding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;How many of the foundation model companies survive is harder to call, but it already seems clear that OpenAI’s chain of interdependencies within Silicon Valley make it too big to fail. Still, a funding reckoning will force it to ratchet up pricing for its services.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI was created in 2015, it pledged to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” That seems increasingly untenable. Sooner or later, the investors who bought in at a $500 billion price tag will push for returns. Those data centers won’t pay for themselves. By that point, many companies and individuals will have come to depend on ChatGPT or other AI services for their everyday workflows. Those able to pay will reap the productivity benefits, scooping up the excess computing power as others are priced out of the market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being able to layer several AI services on top of each other will provide a compounding effect. One example I heard on a recent trip to San Francisco: Ironing out the kinks in vibe coding is simply a matter of taking several passes at the same problem and then running a few more AI agents to look for bugs and security issues. That sounds incredibly GPU-intensive, implying that making AI really deliver on the current productivity promise will require customers to pay far more than most do today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same holds true in physical AI. I fully expect robotaxis to be commonplace in every major city by the end of the decade, and I even expect to see humanoid robots in many homes. But while Waymo’s Uber-like prices in San Francisco and the kinds of low-cost robots produced by China’s Unitree give the impression today that these will soon be affordable for all, the compute cost involved in making them useful and ubiquitous seems destined to turn them into luxuries for the well-off, at least in the near term.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The rest of us, meanwhile, will be left with an internet full of slop and unable to afford AI tools that actually work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps some breakthrough in computational efficiency will avert this fate. But the current AI boom means Silicon Valley’s AI companies lack the incentives to make leaner models or experiment with radically different kinds of chips. That only raises the likelihood that the next wave of AI innovation will come from outside the US, be that China, India, or somewhere even farther afield.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley’s AI boom will surely end before 2030, but the race for global influence over the technology’s development—and the political arguments about how its benefits are distributed—seem set to continue well into the next decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will replies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am with you that the cost of this technology is going to lead to a world of haves and have-nots. Even today, $200+ a month buys power users of ChatGPT or Gemini a very different experience from that of people on the free tier. That capability gap is certain to increase as model makers seek to recoup costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re going to see massive global disparities too. In the Global North, adoption has been off the charts. A recent report from Microsoft’s AI Economy Institute notes that AI is the fastest-spreading technology in human history: “In less than three years, more than 1.2 billion people have used AI tools, a rate of adoption faster than the internet, the personal computer, or even the smartphone.” And yet AI is useless without ready access to electricity and the internet; swathes of the world still have neither.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I still remain skeptical that we will see anything like the revolution that many insiders promise (and investors pray for) by 2030. When Microsoft talks about adoption here, it’s counting casual users rather than measuring long-term technological diffusion, which takes time. Meanwhile, casual users get bored and move on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How about this: If I live with a domestic robot in five years’ time, you can send your laundry to my house in a robotaxi any day of the week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;JK! As if I could afford one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is AI? It sounds like a stupid question, but it’s one that’s never been more urgent. In this deep dive, Will unpacks decades of spin and speculation to get to the heart of our collective technodream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AGI—the idea that machines will be as smart as humans—has hijacked an entire industry (and possibly the US economy). For &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;/em&gt; recent New Conspiracy Age package, Will takes a provocative look at how AGI is like a conspiracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FT examined the economics of self-driving cars this summer, asking who will foot the multi-billion-dollar bill to buy enough robotaxis to serve a big city like London or New York.&lt;br /&gt;A plausible counter-argument to Tim’s thesis on AI inequalities is that freely available open-source (or more accurately, “open weight”) models will keep pulling down prices. The US may want frontier models to be built on US chips but it is already losing the global south to Chinese software.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome back to The State of AI, a new collaboration between the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.

But while Waymo’s Uber-like prices in San Francisco and the kinds of low-cost robots produced by China’s Unitree give the impression today that these will soon be affordable for all, the compute cost involved in making them useful and ubiquitous seems destined to turn them into luxuries for the well-off, at least in the near term.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The rest of us, meanwhile, will be left with an internet full of slop and unable to afford AI tools that actually work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps some breakthrough in computational efficiency will avert this fate. But the current AI boom means Silicon Valley’s AI companies lack the incentives to make leaner models or experiment with radically different kinds of chips. That only raises the likelihood that the next wave of AI innovation will come from outside the US, be that China, India, or somewhere even farther afield.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley’s AI boom will surely end before 2030, but the race for global influence over the technology’s development—and the political arguments about how its benefits are distributed—seem set to continue well into the next decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will replies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am with you that the cost of this technology is going to lead to a world of haves and have-nots. Even today, $200+ a month buys power users of ChatGPT or Gemini a very different experience from that of people on the free tier. That capability gap is certain to increase as model makers seek to recoup costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re going to see massive global disparities too. In the Global North, adoption has been off the charts. A recent report from Microsoft’s AI Economy Institute notes that AI is the fastest-spreading technology in human history: “In less than three years, more than 1.2 billion people have used AI tools, a rate of adoption faster than the internet, the personal computer, or even the smartphone.” And yet AI is useless without ready access to electricity and the internet; swathes of the world still have neither.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I still remain skeptical that we will see anything like the revolution that many insiders promise (and investors pray for) by 2030. When Microsoft talks about adoption here, it’s counting casual users rather than measuring long-term technological diffusion, which takes time. Meanwhile, casual users get bored and move on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How about this: If I live with a domestic robot in five years’ time, you can send your laundry to my house in a robotaxi any day of the week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;JK! As if I could afford one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is AI? It sounds like a stupid question, but it’s one that’s never been more urgent. In this deep dive, Will unpacks decades of spin and speculation to get to the heart of our collective technodream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AGI—the idea that machines will be as smart as humans—has hijacked an entire industry (and possibly the US economy). For &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;/em&gt; recent New Conspiracy Age package, Will takes a provocative look at how AGI is like a conspiracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FT examined the economics of self-driving cars this summer, asking who will foot the multi-billion-dollar bill to buy enough robotaxis to serve a big city like London or New York.&lt;br /&gt;A plausible counter-argument to Tim’s thesis on AI inequalities is that freely available open-source (or more accurately, “open weight”) models will keep pulling down prices. The US may want frontier models to be built on US chips but it is already losing the global south to Chinese software.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/08/1128922/the-state-of-ai-a-vision-of-the-world-in-2030/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] You can buy your Instacart groceries without leaving ChatGPT (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/you-can-buy-your-instacart-groceries-without-leaving-chatgpt/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/OpenAI_Instacart_Partnership_Blog_16-9.webp?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI and Instacart are launching a grocery shopping experience inside of ChatGPT, allowing customers to brainstorm meal ideas, make a grocery list, and check out, all without leaving the chat interface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This builds upon an existing partnership between OpenAI and Instacart; more than two years ago, Instacart launched an in-app AI search tool powered by ChatGPT, which helps shoppers ask questions about what to make for dinner or how to accommodate dietary restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The relationship between OpenAI and Instacart seems to have only deepened after former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo — who was already an OpenAI board member — joined the company as the CEO of Applications in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user’s behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Leading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that&amp;nbsp;AI-assisted online shopping&amp;nbsp;will grow by 520% this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.&lt;/p&gt;

However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pair of screenshots showing what Chrome's agent model can see from a website." class="wp-image-3073681" height="367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Chrome's agent model asking user permission before paying for an item while shopping." class="wp-image-3073680" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?w=657" width="657" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI browser makers are also paying attention to security.
