            &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world in 2022, it brought generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and started a snowball effect that led to its rapid integration into industry, scientific research, health care, and the everyday lives of people who use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes next for this powerful but imperfect tool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that question in mind, hundreds of researchers, business leaders, educators, and students gathered at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium for the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium (MGAIC) Symposium on Sept. 17 to share insights and discuss the potential future of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment — generative AI is moving fast. It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a&amp;nbsp;consortium of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”&lt;/p&gt;

Among those present was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company has become central to the global AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking from a prepared speech about US-UK ties, fresh partnerships, and billions of dollars in pledged investments, Trump admitted he had little knowledge of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will create new government, academic, and private sector cooperation in areas like AI, which is taking over the world […] I’m looking at you guys. You’re taking over the world. Jensen, I don’t know what you’re doing here,” Trump said, drawing laughter from Starmer and the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope you’re right. All I can say is, we both hope you’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump and Starmer sign AI-focused tech deal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the event was the signing of a “Tech Prosperity Deal,” which sets out plans for the two countries to deepen cooperation in emerging technologies. The deal covers projects like developing AI models for healthcare, advancing quantum computing, and modernising nuclear programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Nvidia committed to deploying 120,000 GPUs in Britain. It will be the company’s largest rollout in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nvidia’s parallel move with Intel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Thursday, Nvidia revealed a $5 billion investment in Intel, coupled with a collaboration with Intel on new products. The two companies will work together on custom data centres that support AI systems and on processors for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia said it plans to buy Intel stock at $23.28 a share, subject to regulatory approval. The investment comes as Intel looks to regain ground after years of decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem – a fusion of two world-class platforms,” Huang said. “Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data centres, Intel will design chips that support Nvidia’s AI infrastructure. For desktop PCs, Intel will manufacture processors that integrate Nvidia’s technology, giving the firm a chance to push into areas where it has lost momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A lifeline for Intel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership offers a boost for Intel, once the backbone of personal computers but now struggling to keep pace. The company missed the shift to smartphones after Apple’s iPhone transformed the market in 2007, and more recently it has lagged behind in the AI hardware race. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the world’s most valuable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors reacted quickly: Intel’s shares jumped 30% in premarket trading, while Nvidia’s stock rose nearly 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before signing the deal, Trump added a dose of humour, turning to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and asking, “Should I sign this? Are you sure, Scott? If the deal’s no good, I’m blaming you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the visit to the UK, Trump also said he hoped AI would be handled wisely by the experts leading its development, since he admitted it was beyond his understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump administration monitors AI competition closely&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While partnerships expand, US regulators are also tightening their focus on competition in AI. Speaking at a conference in New York, Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater said the US Justice Department is on alert for anticompetitive behaviour in the sector. “The competitive dynamics of each layer of the AI stack and how they interrelate, with a particular eye towards exclusionary behaviour that forecloses access to key inputs and distribution channels, are legitimate areas for antitrust inquiry,” she said. “Of course, a truly open-source model must be one that is not unilaterally maintained by a single vendor that exerts unwarranted influence and impose restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key area is access to data. A federal judge in Washington recently ordered Google to share some of its search data with rivals, including AI companies, to help level the playing field in online search. Google has said it will appeal that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slater’s remarks reflect a continuity of concern.

But scaling AI is not easy. It demands strong infrastructure, reliable data management, and the ability to deploy models quickly in different workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell has positioned itself to help companies make the leap. Its AI Factory, Data Lakehouse, and AI Data Platform – developed with support from NVIDIA and other partners – aim to give enterprises the building blocks needed to turn experiments into production systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Christian Spindeldreher, EMEA Field Technology Officer for Data Management and AI at Dell Technologies, about what this shift looks like in practice, and how Dell’s latest developments are being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From pilots to measurable outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spindeldreher explained that Dell’s AI Factory and AI Data Platform, built on the Data Lakehouse, provide a unified foundation for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109468" height="703" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Christian-Spindeldreher-EMEA-Field-Technology-Officer-for-Data-Management-and-AI-at-Dell-Technologies.jpg" width="563" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Christian Spindeldreher, EMEA Field Technology Officer for Data Management and AI at Dell Technologies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating high-performance infrastructure with streamlined data management and accelerated model development, organisations can move beyond experimentation and deploy AI rapidly in workflows,” he said. The platform also simplifies access, governance, and analytics, giving teams the tools to generate value at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close partnership with NVIDIA brings compute and software tuned for demanding AI workloads, helping enterprises tackle more complex use cases without losing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dell’s AI Data Platform unlocks unstructured data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell recently added new capabilities to the AI Data Platform, including an unstructured data engine developed with Elastic and GPU-accelerated PowerEdge servers. The allows companies to handle the vast amount of information locked in documents, videos, and images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Elastic-powered unstructured data engine enables real-time semantic and hybrid search, rapid content indexing, and secure access to massive volumes of unstructured data,” Spindeldreher said. This unlocks use cases like AI-driven knowledge retrieval, advanced digital assistants, recommendation systems, and real-time compliance checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPU acceleration, powered by Dell PowerEdge servers and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, means enterprises can now run agentic AI workflows and multimodal analytics directly on these large datasets. Tasks like video summarisation, synthetic data generation, and generative AI asset management become more practical. “The updates deliver up to six times the token throughput for LLMs, support for more concurrent users, and make high-performance AI compute more accessible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tackling data gravity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in scaling AI is that data often sits in different places, making it expensive and slow to move. Dell’s Data Lakehouse aims to solve this by supporting federated queries in multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means organisations don’t need to create multiple copies of the same dataset. Integrated into a broader Data Fabric, the system ensures consistent access while also supporting domain-oriented Data Mesh principles that give teams autonomy over their own data. The end result, said Spindeldreher, is faster insights without duplication or unnecessary movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dell’s AI Factory drives faster AI adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell’s AI Factory model has also helped speed adoption in industries where data sensitivity is a major concern. By keeping workloads on-premise, organisations avoid the delays and risks tied to cloud migration and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthcare, finance, and government have seen faster time-to-value by using advanced AI tools while upholding strict privacy and residency requirements,” Spindeldreher said. Dell also provides services that cover everything from strategy to operations, giving customers a more straightforward path to adoption while managing complexity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling infrastructure with partners&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships are another part of Dell’s approach. The company is supplying servers for CoreWeave’s rollout of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, a project that demands high performance and efficient cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The platforms support the most demanding AI workflows,” Spindeldreher explained. “Scalability is key here – combined with efficient cooling to support maximum performance from rack to full data centre scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a unified ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind these updates and partnerships is a broader strategy of integration. Dell’s goal, according to Spindeldreher, is simple: “faster time to value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI Factory helps customers identify the right use cases, while the Data Platform adds features for data processing, analytics, and secure consumption. Together, they allow organisations to spend less time designing platforms and more time applying AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Governance and responsible scaling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI spreads in industries, the risks around governance and security are also growing. Spindeldreher highlighted Dell’s work in embedding these principles into its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The use of data products and data federation (even in clusters and locations) allows us to consolidate and secure data access,” he said. But he also pointed out that technology alone is not enough – enterprises need data strategies and supporting tools like Data Catalogs to manage compliance in multi-cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of Dell and AI: what’s next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Spindeldreher expects enterprises to move deeper into operational AI.

But scaling AI is not easy. It demands strong infrastructure, reliable data management, and the ability to deploy models quickly in different workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell has positioned itself to help companies make the leap. Its AI Factory, Data Lakehouse, and AI Data Platform – developed with support from NVIDIA and other partners – aim to give enterprises the building blocks needed to turn experiments into production systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI News&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Christian Spindeldreher, EMEA Field Technology Officer for Data Management and AI at Dell Technologies, about what this shift looks like in practice, and how Dell’s latest developments are being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From pilots to measurable outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spindeldreher explained that Dell’s AI Factory and AI Data Platform, built on the Data Lakehouse, provide a unified foundation for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-109468" height="703" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Christian-Spindeldreher-EMEA-Field-Technology-Officer-for-Data-Management-and-AI-at-Dell-Technologies.jpg" width="563" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Christian Spindeldreher, EMEA Field Technology Officer for Data Management and AI at Dell Technologies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating high-performance infrastructure with streamlined data management and accelerated model development, organisations can move beyond experimentation and deploy AI rapidly in workflows,” he said. The platform also simplifies access, governance, and analytics, giving teams the tools to generate value at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close partnership with NVIDIA brings compute and software tuned for demanding AI workloads, helping enterprises tackle more complex use cases without losing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dell’s AI Data Platform unlocks unstructured data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell recently added new capabilities to the AI Data Platform, including an unstructured data engine developed with Elastic and GPU-accelerated PowerEdge servers. The allows companies to handle the vast amount of information locked in documents, videos, and images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Elastic-powered unstructured data engine enables real-time semantic and hybrid search, rapid content indexing, and secure access to massive volumes of unstructured data,” Spindeldreher said. This unlocks use cases like AI-driven knowledge retrieval, advanced digital assistants, recommendation systems, and real-time compliance checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPU acceleration, powered by Dell PowerEdge servers and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, means enterprises can now run agentic AI workflows and multimodal analytics directly on these large datasets. Tasks like video summarisation, synthetic data generation, and generative AI asset management become more practical. “The updates deliver up to six times the token throughput for LLMs, support for more concurrent users, and make high-performance AI compute more accessible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tackling data gravity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in scaling AI is that data often sits in different places, making it expensive and slow to move. Dell’s Data Lakehouse aims to solve this by supporting federated queries in multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means organisations don’t need to create multiple copies of the same dataset. Integrated into a broader Data Fabric, the system ensures consistent access while also supporting domain-oriented Data Mesh principles that give teams autonomy over their own data. The end result, said Spindeldreher, is faster insights without duplication or unnecessary movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dell’s AI Factory drives faster AI adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell’s AI Factory model has also helped speed adoption in industries where data sensitivity is a major concern. By keeping workloads on-premise, organisations avoid the delays and risks tied to cloud migration and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthcare, finance, and government have seen faster time-to-value by using advanced AI tools while upholding strict privacy and residency requirements,” Spindeldreher said. Dell also provides services that cover everything from strategy to operations, giving customers a more straightforward path to adoption while managing complexity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling infrastructure with partners&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships are another part of Dell’s approach. The company is supplying servers for CoreWeave’s rollout of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, a project that demands high performance and efficient cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The platforms support the most demanding AI workflows,” Spindeldreher explained. “Scalability is key here – combined with efficient cooling to support maximum performance from rack to full data centre scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a unified ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind these updates and partnerships is a broader strategy of integration. Dell’s goal, according to Spindeldreher, is simple: “faster time to value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI Factory helps customers identify the right use cases, while the Data Platform adds features for data processing, analytics, and secure consumption. Together, they allow organisations to spend less time designing platforms and more time applying AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Governance and responsible scaling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI spreads in industries, the risks around governance and security are also growing. Spindeldreher highlighted Dell’s work in embedding these principles into its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The use of data products and data federation (even in clusters and locations) allows us to consolidate and secure data access,” he said. But he also pointed out that technology alone is not enough – enterprises need data strategies and supporting tools like Data Catalogs to manage compliance in multi-cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of Dell and AI: what’s next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Spindeldreher expects enterprises to move deeper into operational AI. Agentic AI, edge AI, and multi-modal systems will play a larger role, supported by new generations of compute, accelerators, and networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell also sees a place for AI closer to end users. “And not to forget,” he said, “the increasing use of AI on personal devices like AI-enabled PCs and laptops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian Spindeldreher and the Dell Technologies team will be sharing more insights at this year’s AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Europe in Amsterdam on 24-25 September 2025.
