You can read more from the series here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the draconian cuts to US federal funding for science, including the administration’s proposal to reducethe 2026 budgets of the National Institutes of Health by 40% and the National Science Foundation by 57%, it’s worth asking some hard-nosed money questions: How much &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;we be spending on R&amp;amp;D? How much value do we get out of such investments, anyway? To answer that, it’s important to look at both successful returns and investments that went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s easy to argue for the importance of spending on science by pointing out that many of today’s most useful technologies had their origins in government-funded R&amp;amp;D. The internet, CRISPR, GPS—the list goes on and on. All true. But this argument ignores all the technologies that received millions in government funding and haven’t gone anywhere—at least not yet. We still don’t have DNA computers or molecular electronics. Never mind the favorite examples cited by contrarian politicians of seemingly silly or frivolous science projects (think shrimp on treadmills).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While cherry-picking success stories help illustrate the glories of innovation and the role of science in creating technologies that have changed our lives, it provides little guidance for how much we should spend in the future—and where the money should go.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;A far more useful approach to quantifying the value of R&amp;amp;D is to look at its return on investment (ROI). A favorite metric for stock pickers and PowerPoint-wielding venture capitalists, ROI weighs benefits versus costs. If applied broadly to the nation’s R&amp;amp;D funding, the same kind of thinking could help account for both the big wins &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; all the money spent on research that never got out of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that it’s notoriously difficult to calculate returns for science funding—the payoffs can take years to appear and often take a circuitous route, so the eventual rewards are distant from the original funding. (Who could have predicted Uber as an outcome of GPS? For that matter, who could have predicted that the invention of ultra-precise atomic clocks in the late 1940s and 1950s would eventually make GPS possible?) And forget trying to track the costs of countless failures or apparent dead ends.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But in several recent papers, economists have approached the problem in clever new ways, and though they ask slightly different questions, their conclusions share a bottom line: R&amp;amp;D is, in fact, one of the better long-term investments that the government can make.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s "America Undone” series, examining how the foundations of US success in science and innovation are currently under threat.&amp;nbsp;You can read the rest here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That might not seem very surprising. We’ve long thought that innovation and scientific advances are key to our prosperity. But the new studies provide much-needed details, supplying systematic and rigorous evidence for the impact that R&amp;amp;D funding, including public investment in basic science, has on overall economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the magnitude of the benefits &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;surprising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban&lt;/strong&gt;g for your buck&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In “A Calculation of the Social Returns to Innovation,” Benjamin Jones, an economist at Northwestern University, and Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist and former US Treasury secretary, calculate the effects of the nation’s total R&amp;amp;D spending on gross domestic product and our overall standard of living. They’re taking on the big picture, and it’s ambitious because there are so many variables. But they are able to come up with a convincing range of estimates for the returns, all of them impressive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the conservative end of their estimates, says Jones, investing $1 in R&amp;amp;D yields about $5 in returns—defined in this case as additional GDP per person (basically, how much richer we become). Change some of the assumptions—for example, by attempting to account for the value of better medicines and improved health care, which aren’t fully captured in GDP—and you get even larger payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the $5 return is at the low end of their estimates, it’s still “a remarkably good investment,” Jones says. “There aren’t many where you put in $1 and get $5 back."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s the return for the nation’s overall R&amp;amp;D funding. But what do we get for government-funded R&amp;amp;D in particular? Andrew Fieldhouse, an economist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, and Karel Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas looked specifically at how changes in public R&amp;amp;D spending affect the total factor productivity (TFP) of businesses. A favorite metric of economists, TFP is driven by new technologies and innovative business know-how—not by adding more workers or machines—and is the main driver of the nation’s prosperity over the long term.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The economists tracked changes in R&amp;amp;D spending at five major US science funding agencies over many decades to see how the shifts eventually affected private-sector productivity. They found that the government was getting a huge bang for its nondefense R&amp;amp;D buck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits begin kicking in after around five to 10 years and often have a long-lasting impact on the economy. Nondefense public R&amp;amp;D funding has been responsible for 20% to 25% of all private-sector productivity growth in the country since World War II, according to the economists. It’s an astonishing number, given that the government invests relatively little in nondefense R&amp;amp;D. For example, its spending on infrastructure, another contributor to productivity growth, has been far greater over those years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The large impact of public R&amp;amp;D investments also provides insight into one of America’s most troubling economic mysteries: the slowdown in productivity growth that began in the 1970s, which has roiled the country’s politics as many people face stunted living standards and limited financial prospects. Their research, says Fieldhouse, suggests that as much as a quarter of that slowdown was caused by a decline in public R&amp;amp;D funding that happened roughly over the same time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After reaching a high of 1.86% of GDP in 1964, federal R&amp;amp;D spending began dropping. Starting in the early 1970s, TFP growth also began to decline, from above 2% a year in the late 1960s to somewhere around 1% since the 1970s (with the exception of a rise during the late 1990s), roughly tracking the spending declines with a lag of a few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If in fact the productivity slowdown was at least partially caused by a drop in public R&amp;amp;D spending, it’s evidence that we would be far richer today if we had kept up a higher level of science investment. And it also flags the dangers of today’s proposed cuts. “Based on our research,” says Fieldhouse, “I think it’s unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there’s going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Out of whack&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget would slash science budgets to an unusual degree, public funding of R&amp;amp;D has actually been in slow decline for decades. Federal funding of science is at its lowest rate in the last 70 years, accounting for only around 0.6% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even as public funding has dropped, business R&amp;amp;D investments have steadily risen. Today businesses spend far more than the government; in 2023, companies invested about $700 billion in R&amp;amp;D while the US government spent $172 billion, according to data from the NSF’s statistical agency. You might think, &lt;em&gt;Good—let companies do research. It’s more efficient. It’s more focused. Keep the government out of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there is a big problem with that argument. Publicly funded research, it turns out, tends to lead to relatively more productivity growth over time because it skews more toward fundamental science than the applied work typically done by companies.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In a new working paper called “Public R&amp;amp;D Spillovers and Productivity Growth,” Arnaud Dyèvre, an assistant professor at of economics at HEC Paris, documents the broad and often large impacts of so-called knowledge spillovers—the benefits that flow to others from work done by the original research group. Dyèvre found that the spillovers of public-funded R&amp;amp;D have three times more impact on productivity growth across businesses and industries than those from private R&amp;amp;D funding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The findings are preliminary, and Dyèvre is still updating the research—much of which he did as a postdoc at MIT—but he says it does suggest that the US “is underinvesting in fundamental R&amp;amp;D,” which is heavily funded by the government. “I wouldn’t be able to tell you exactly which percentage of R&amp;amp;D in the US needs to be funded by the government or what percent needs to be funded by the private sector. We need both,” he says. But, he adds, “the empirical evidence” suggests that “we’re out of balance.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting the balance of funding for fundamental science and applied research right is just one of the big questions that remain around R&amp;amp;D funding. In mid-July, Open Philanthropy and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, both nonprofit organizations, jointly announced that theyplanned to fund a five-year “pop-up journal” that would attempt to answer many of the questions still swirling around how to define and optimize the ROI of research funding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of evidence consistent with a really high return to R&amp;amp;D, which suggests we should do more of it,” says Matt Clancy, a senior program officer at Open Philanthropy. “But when you ask me how much more, I don’t have a good answer. And when you ask me what types of R&amp;amp;D should get more funding, we don’t have a good answer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pondering such questions should keep innovation economists busy for the next several years. But there is another mystifying piece of the puzzle, says Northwestern’s Jones. If the returns on R&amp;amp;D investments are so high—the kind that most venture capitalists or investors would gladly take—why isn’t the government spending more?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I think it’s unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there’s going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jones, who served as a senior economic advisor in the Obama administration, says discussions over R&amp;amp;D budgets in Washington are often “a war of anecdotes.” Science advocates cite the great breakthroughs that resulted from earlier government funding, while budget hawks point to seemingly ludicrous projects or spectacular failures. Both have plenty of ammunition. “People go back and forth,” says Jones, “and it doesn’t really lead to anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The policy gridlock is rooted in in the very nature of fundamental research. Today’s science will lead to great advances. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; there will be countless failures; a lot of money &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be wasted on fruitless experiments. The problem, of course, is that when you’re deciding to fund new projects, it’s impossible to predict which the outcome will be, even in the case of odd, seemingly silly science. Guessing just what research will or will not lead to the next great breakthrough is a fool’s errand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take the cuts in the administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget for the NSF, a leading funder of basic science. The administration’s summary begins with the assertion that its NSF budget “is prioritizing investments that complement private-sector R&amp;amp;D and offer strong potential to drive economic growth and strengthen U.S. technological leadership.” So far, so good. It cites the government’s commitment to AI and quantum information science. But dig deeper and you will see the contradictions in the numbers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Not only is NSF's overall budget cut by 57%, but funding for physical sciences like chemistry and materials research—fields critical to advancing AI and quantum computers—has also been blown apart.Funding for the NSF’s mathematical and physical sciences program was reduced by 67%. The directorate for computer and information science and engineering fared little better; its research funding was cut by 66%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of hope among many in the science community that Congress, when it passes the actual 2026 budget, will at least partially reverse these cuts. We’ll see. But even if it does, why attack R&amp;amp;D funding in the first place? It’s impossible to answer that without plunging into the messy depths of today’s chaotic politics. And it is equally hard to know whether the recent evidence gathered by academic economists on the strong returns to R&amp;amp;D investments will matter when it comes to partisan policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at least those defending the value of public funding now have a far more productive way to make their argument, rather than simply touting past breakthroughs. Even for fiscal hawks and those pronouncing concerns about budget deficits, the recent work provides a compelling and simple conclusion: More public funding for basic science is a sound investment that makes us more prosperous.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/research-spending-usa.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt; Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next.

Change some of the assumptions—for example, by attempting to account for the value of better medicines and improved health care, which aren’t fully captured in GDP—and you get even larger payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the $5 return is at the low end of their estimates, it’s still “a remarkably good investment,” Jones says. “There aren’t many where you put in $1 and get $5 back."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s the return for the nation’s overall R&amp;amp;D funding. But what do we get for government-funded R&amp;amp;D in particular? Andrew Fieldhouse, an economist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, and Karel Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas looked specifically at how changes in public R&amp;amp;D spending affect the total factor productivity (TFP) of businesses. A favorite metric of economists, TFP is driven by new technologies and innovative business know-how—not by adding more workers or machines—and is the main driver of the nation’s prosperity over the long term.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The economists tracked changes in R&amp;amp;D spending at five major US science funding agencies over many decades to see how the shifts eventually affected private-sector productivity. They found that the government was getting a huge bang for its nondefense R&amp;amp;D buck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits begin kicking in after around five to 10 years and often have a long-lasting impact on the economy. Nondefense public R&amp;amp;D funding has been responsible for 20% to 25% of all private-sector productivity growth in the country since World War II, according to the economists. It’s an astonishing number, given that the government invests relatively little in nondefense R&amp;amp;D. For example, its spending on infrastructure, another contributor to productivity growth, has been far greater over those years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The large impact of public R&amp;amp;D investments also provides insight into one of America’s most troubling economic mysteries: the slowdown in productivity growth that began in the 1970s, which has roiled the country’s politics as many people face stunted living standards and limited financial prospects. Their research, says Fieldhouse, suggests that as much as a quarter of that slowdown was caused by a decline in public R&amp;amp;D funding that happened roughly over the same time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After reaching a high of 1.86% of GDP in 1964, federal R&amp;amp;D spending began dropping. Starting in the early 1970s, TFP growth also began to decline, from above 2% a year in the late 1960s to somewhere around 1% since the 1970s (with the exception of a rise during the late 1990s), roughly tracking the spending declines with a lag of a few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If in fact the productivity slowdown was at least partially caused by a drop in public R&amp;amp;D spending, it’s evidence that we would be far richer today if we had kept up a higher level of science investment. And it also flags the dangers of today’s proposed cuts. “Based on our research,” says Fieldhouse, “I think it’s unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there’s going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Out of whack&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget would slash science budgets to an unusual degree, public funding of R&amp;amp;D has actually been in slow decline for decades. Federal funding of science is at its lowest rate in the last 70 years, accounting for only around 0.6% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even as public funding has dropped, business R&amp;amp;D investments have steadily risen. Today businesses spend far more than the government; in 2023, companies invested about $700 billion in R&amp;amp;D while the US government spent $172 billion, according to data from the NSF’s statistical agency. You might think, &lt;em&gt;Good—let companies do research. It’s more efficient. It’s more focused. Keep the government out of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there is a big problem with that argument. Publicly funded research, it turns out, tends to lead to relatively more productivity growth over time because it skews more toward fundamental science than the applied work typically done by companies.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In a new working paper called “Public R&amp;amp;D Spillovers and Productivity Growth,” Arnaud Dyèvre, an assistant professor at of economics at HEC Paris, documents the broad and often large impacts of so-called knowledge spillovers—the benefits that flow to others from work done by the original research group. Dyèvre found that the spillovers of public-funded R&amp;amp;D have three times more impact on productivity growth across businesses and industries than those from private R&amp;amp;D funding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The findings are preliminary, and Dyèvre is still updating the research—much of which he did as a postdoc at MIT—but he says it does suggest that the US “is underinvesting in fundamental R&amp;amp;D,” which is heavily funded by the government. “I wouldn’t be able to tell you exactly which percentage of R&amp;amp;D in the US needs to be funded by the government or what percent needs to be funded by the private sector. We need both,” he says. But, he adds, “the empirical evidence” suggests that “we’re out of balance.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting the balance of funding for fundamental science and applied research right is just one of the big questions that remain around R&amp;amp;D funding. In mid-July, Open Philanthropy and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, both nonprofit organizations, jointly announced that theyplanned to fund a five-year “pop-up journal” that would attempt to answer many of the questions still swirling around how to define and optimize the ROI of research funding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of evidence consistent with a really high return to R&amp;amp;D, which suggests we should do more of it,” says Matt Clancy, a senior program officer at Open Philanthropy. “But when you ask me how much more, I don’t have a good answer. And when you ask me what types of R&amp;amp;D should get more funding, we don’t have a good answer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pondering such questions should keep innovation economists busy for the next several years. But there is another mystifying piece of the puzzle, says Northwestern’s Jones. If the returns on R&amp;amp;D investments are so high—the kind that most venture capitalists or investors would gladly take—why isn’t the government spending more?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I think it’s unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there’s going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jones, who served as a senior economic advisor in the Obama administration, says discussions over R&amp;amp;D budgets in Washington are often “a war of anecdotes.” Science advocates cite the great breakthroughs that resulted from earlier government funding, while budget hawks point to seemingly ludicrous projects or spectacular failures. Both have plenty of ammunition. “People go back and forth,” says Jones, “and it doesn’t really lead to anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The policy gridlock is rooted in in the very nature of fundamental research. Today’s science will lead to great advances. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; there will be countless failures; a lot of money &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be wasted on fruitless experiments. The problem, of course, is that when you’re deciding to fund new projects, it’s impossible to predict which the outcome will be, even in the case of odd, seemingly silly science. Guessing just what research will or will not lead to the next great breakthrough is a fool’s errand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take the cuts in the administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget for the NSF, a leading funder of basic science. The administration’s summary begins with the assertion that its NSF budget “is prioritizing investments that complement private-sector R&amp;amp;D and offer strong potential to drive economic growth and strengthen U.S. technological leadership.” So far, so good. It cites the government’s commitment to AI and quantum information science. But dig deeper and you will see the contradictions in the numbers.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Not only is NSF's overall budget cut by 57%, but funding for physical sciences like chemistry and materials research—fields critical to advancing AI and quantum computers—has also been blown apart.Funding for the NSF’s mathematical and physical sciences program was reduced by 67%. The directorate for computer and information science and engineering fared little better; its research funding was cut by 66%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of hope among many in the science community that Congress, when it passes the actual 2026 budget, will at least partially reverse these cuts. We’ll see. But even if it does, why attack R&amp;amp;D funding in the first place? It’s impossible to answer that without plunging into the messy depths of today’s chaotic politics. And it is equally hard to know whether the recent evidence gathered by academic economists on the strong returns to R&amp;amp;D investments will matter when it comes to partisan policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at least those defending the value of public funding now have a far more productive way to make their argument, rather than simply touting past breakthroughs. Even for fiscal hawks and those pronouncing concerns about budget deficits, the recent work provides a compelling and simple conclusion: More public funding for basic science is a sound investment that makes us more prosperous.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123760/how-to-measure-the-returns-to-rd-spending/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Sonair built its 3D ultrasonic sensor with robotic safety in mind (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/sonair-built-its-3d-ultrasonic-sensor-with-robotic-safety-in-mind/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sonair-AMRinwarehouse.png?resize=1200,590" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As robots increasingly enter human spaces, robotics companies will need to think about safety differently than they did when robots were largely siloed from their human counterparts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sonair thinks its sensors can help robotics companies reach their safety goals — with a solution that is both better and cheaper than popular LIDAR technology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Oslo, Norway-based company built an ADAR (acoustic detection and ranging) sensor for robots that uses high frequency sound. These sensors send out ultrasound waves and capture how the sound echoes back. These signals give robots a three-dimensional view of their surroundings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This data complements a robot’s other sensors and cameras to give the robot’s operating system a clearer picture of the environment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Perception for a human — what we’re using the most is our eyes, but we’re also using other senses to perceive our environment, our ears and our brain to interpret all our senses,” said Sonair co-founder and CEO Knut Sandven in an interview with TechCrunch. “The same is for robots or autonomous machines. They’re using cameras. Cameras are really great to understand the environment, but they’re not good for reliably detecting objects under all circumstances.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sonair is designed to help fill those gaps —&amp;nbsp;especially for depth perception. Traditionally, robotics companies turn to LIDAR sensors, which send out beams of light and measure how they bounce back, to gather that information. Sandven said Sonair’s sensors are a better option because they can capture more comprehensive data. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“LIDAR is like swiping a laser pointer,” Sandven said. “[But] if you shout out in a room, you will fill the room with sound. We will fill the room with sound.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sensor’s output is structured in a standard industry format, Sandven said, so it’s designed to work alongside a variety of different robotic hardware and software. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company released its sensor earlier this year and has since seen strong demand from the robotics field, with multiple companies planning to incorporate Sonair’s sensors into their next robot models, Sandven said. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sonair has also seen demand from the industrial safety sector. Sandven said companies are using the sensors to detect when people enter areas with heavy machinery so the machines can be shut off automatically before an accident happens. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Sonair is looking to scale up adoption of its tech and just raised a $6 million round to do so. The round included new and returning investors Scale Capital, Norway’s state-backed Investinor, and ProVenture, among others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sandven said that investors who are active in the robotics space immediately understood the problem that the company is looking to solve. This isn’t surprising as safety will likely become a major concern as robots start interacting with humans more —&amp;nbsp;not unlike the safety conversations that emerged in the early days of the self-driving car industry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fady Saad, a general partner, at robotics-focused Cybernetix Ventures, which is not an investor in Sonair, recently told TechCrunch that potential safety concerns were one of the reasons he doesn’t expect people to want humanoid robots in their home anytime soon. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The “kind of dirty secret of humanoids at homes s there’s a lot of safety, lots of security, lots of concerns,” Saad told TechCrunch in August. “If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them, right? This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sandven said Sonair doesn’t currently have direct competition for its sonar-based sensors, but that could change as more companies try to find safety solutions for robots. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“My goal is to have this technology in all robots, like you have with cameras,” Sandven said. “If we talk again this time next year, we will have a pretty good indication whether that is the direction we are heading.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sonair-AMRinwarehouse.png?resize=1200,590" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As robots increasingly enter human spaces, robotics companies will need to think about safety differently than they did when robots were largely siloed from their human counterparts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $10 million Series A closed in just 14 days, with Google Ventures doubling down after first backing Blacksmith’s $3.5 million seed in May. At the time, Alphabet’s VC arm bet on the size of the market and the founding team, which included veterans of Cockroach Labs, another GV portfolio company. But for this round, GV was swayed by results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blacksmith, which offers a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for developers that complements GitHub actions, had pulled in hundreds of customers since May, and the boom in AI coding agents has blown the market wide open, co-founder and CEO Aditya Jayaprakash (pictured above on the left) said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The San Francisco–based startup hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in February with just four people — Jayaprakash, co-founders Aayush Shah and Aditya Maru, and a product designer. Since then, revenue has reached $3.5 million ARR with more than 700 customers, supported by a team of eight, and the company is aiming to double that figure by year’s end, Jayaprakash told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in January 2024, Blacksmith was born from the experiences of its founders, who met at the University of Waterloo before building large-scale distributed systems at Faire and Cockroach Labs. There, they saw firsthand how costly and unpredictable the build and unit testing stages of software releases, known as continuous integration (CI), can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You would have to spin up hundreds of machines and burn through hundreds of hours of computing power just to test new code before shipping it, Jayaprakash said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A typical software development process involves developers continuously pushing new code into repositories such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. To manage the testing and integration of that code, cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure all offer their own solutions — but these are often slower, costlier, or less predictable than teams need.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike many rivals that rent generic cloud servers from cloud providers like AWS, Blacksmith’s service runs on  high-performance, gaming-grade CPUs. The result, the startup says, is up to double the processing speed and lowering, by as much as 75%, compute costs. And because teams can switch by changing just a single line of code, they can start shipping faster within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we’re going the bare-metal route, we have much better control over our economics compared to the hyperscalers,” Jayaprakash told TechCrunch. “I’m not saying every company should go bare metal… but if you are a compute company, if you are an infra company, where your bread and butter is compute, like ourselves, it makes a lot of sense, and it gives us abundant control over our margins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By using hardware at its premises, the startup improves its margins as it grows its customer base, the founder said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blacksmith also offers test analytics and an observability roadmap, giving customers deeper insights into GitHub Actions — GitHub’s CI/CD platform that automates how developers test and deploy software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blacksmith targets companies with teams of 500 engineers or more. Customers already running their GitHub Actions through the platform include Ashby, Chroma, Clerk, Devsisters, Mintlify, Pylon, Slope, Supabase, and VEED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest funding round also saw participation from existing investors and angels, including Spencer Kimball, CEO of Cockroach Labs, and David Cramer, co-founder of Sentry. Blacksmith launched out of Y Combinator’s Winter 2024 batch and today has a team of 11.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/blacksmith-founders.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As speed becomes the defining currency in an AI-driven software world, Blacksmith has raised another round led by Google Ventures — just four months after its seed — to accelerate how code gets shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $10 million Series A closed in just 14 days, with Google Ventures doubling down after first backing Blacksmith’s $3.5 million seed in May. At the time, Alphabet’s VC arm bet on the size of the market and the founding team, which included veterans of Cockroach Labs, another GV portfolio company. But for this round, GV was swayed by results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blacksmith, which offers a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for developers that complements GitHub actions, had pulled in hundreds of customers since May, and the boom in AI coding agents has blown the market wide open, co-founder and CEO Aditya Jayaprakash (pictured above on the left) said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The San Francisco–based startup hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in February with just four people — Jayaprakash, co-founders Aayush Shah and Aditya Maru, and a product designer. Since then, revenue has reached $3.5 million ARR with more than 700 customers, supported by a team of eight, and the company is aiming to double that figure by year’s end, Jayaprakash told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in January 2024, Blacksmith was born from the experiences of its founders, who met at the University of Waterloo before building large-scale distributed systems at Faire and Cockroach Labs. There, they saw firsthand how costly and unpredictable the build and unit testing stages of software releases, known as continuous integration (CI), can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You would have to spin up hundreds of machines and burn through hundreds of hours of computing power just to test new code before shipping it, Jayaprakash said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A typical software development process involves developers continuously pushing new code into repositories such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. To manage the testing and integration of that code, cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure all offer their own solutions — but these are often slower, costlier, or less predictable than teams need.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike many rivals that rent generic cloud servers from cloud providers like AWS, Blacksmith’s service runs on  high-performance, gaming-grade CPUs. The result, the startup says, is up to double the processing speed and lowering, by as much as 75%, compute costs. And because teams can switch by changing just a single line of code, they can start shipping faster within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we’re going the bare-metal route, we have much better control over our economics compared to the hyperscalers,” Jayaprakash told TechCrunch. “I’m not saying every company should go bare metal… but if you are a compute company, if you are an infra company, where your bread and butter is compute, like ourselves, it makes a lot of sense, and it gives us abundant control over our margins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By using hardware at its premises, the startup improves its margins as it grows its customer base, the founder said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blacksmith also offers test analytics and an observability roadmap, giving customers deeper insights into GitHub Actions — GitHub’s CI/CD platform that automates how developers test and deploy software.&lt;/p&gt;

This is to meet the demands introduced by new regulations, cloud adoption, financial constraints, and a shortage of skilled workers, the AI security specialist claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way companies in France choose security services is changing,” said Julien Escribe, partner and managing director, ISG. “With increasing security budgets, enterprises need guidance and insight to set the right priorities and tackle security problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are starting to rely on all-in-one solutions for security, rather than depending on a range of separate tools, according to the report. Organisations seek service providers that can supplement their security teams. Companies migrating to multicloud and cloud topologies face integration, visibility, and management challenges, the company says. Businesses find it hard to maintain oversight of applications, so use solutions like secure access service edge (SASE), which merges network security and connectivity in a unified service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that French organisations are seeking integrated security platforms for a single view of possible threats and central oversight of their defences.
