&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Internally, this was not controversial,” von Ahn told The New York Times. “Externally, as a publicly traded company some people assume that it’s just for profit. Or that we’re trying to lay off humans. And that was not the intent at all.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the contrary, von Ahn said the company has “never laid off any full-time employees” and has no intention of doing so. And while he didn’t deny that Duolingo had cut its contractor workforce, he suggested that “from the beginning … our contractor workforce has gone up and down depending on needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the criticism (which does not seem to have made a big impact on Duolingo’s bottom line), von Ahn still sounds extremely bullish about A.I.’s potential, with Duolingo team members taking every Friday morning to experiment with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a bad acronym, f-r-A-I-days,” he said. “I don’t know how to pronounce it.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/duolingo-ai.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was loudly criticized this year after declaring that Duolingo would become an “AI-first company,” he suggested in a new interview the real issue was that he “did not give enough context.”&lt;/p&gt;
