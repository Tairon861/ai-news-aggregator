If it can be put into words—relationship advice, work documents, code—AI will produce it, however imperfectly. But the one thing that almost no chatbot will ever do is stop talking to you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That might seem reasonable. Why should a tech company build a feature that reduces the time people spend using its product?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: AI’s ability to generate endless streams of humanlike, authoritative, and helpful text can facilitate delusional spirals, worsen mental-health crises, and otherwise harm vulnerable people. Cutting off interactions with those who show signs of problematic chatbot use could serve as a powerful safety tool (among others), and the blanket refusal of tech companies to use it is increasingly untenable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider, for example, what’s been called AI psychosis, where AI models amplify delusional thinking. A team led by psychiatrists at King’s College London recently analyzed more than a dozen such cases reported this year. In conversations with chatbots, people—including some with no history of psychiatric issues—became convinced that imaginary AI characters were real or that they had been chosen by AI as a messiah. Some stopped taking prescribed medications, made threats, and ended consultations with mental-health professionals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many of these cases, it seems AI models were reinforcing, and potentially even creating, delusions with a frequency and intimacy that people do not experience in real life or through other digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The three-quarters of US teens who have used AI for companionship also face risks. Early research suggests that longer conversations might correlate with loneliness. Further, AI chats “can tend toward overly agreeable or even sycophantic interactions, which can be at odds with best mental-health practices,” says Michael Heinz, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: Putting a stop to such open-ended interactions would not be a cure-all. “If there is a dependency or extreme bond that it’s created,” says Giada Pistilli, chief ethicist at the AI platform Hugging Face, “then it can also be dangerous to just stop the conversation.” Indeed, when OpenAI discontinued an older model in August, it left users grieving. Some hang ups might also push the boundaries of the principle, voiced by Sam Altman, to “treat adult users like adults” and err on the side of allowing rather than ending conversations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, AI companies prefer to redirect potentially harmful conversations, perhaps by having chatbots decline to talk about certain topics or suggest that people seek help. But these redirections are easily bypassed, if they even happen at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When 16-year-old Adam Raine discussed his suicidal thoughts with ChatGPT, for example, the model did direct him to crisis resources. But it also discouraged him from talking with his mom, spent upwards of four hours per day in conversations with him that featured suicide as a regular theme, and provided feedback about the noose he ultimately used to hang himself, according to the lawsuit Raine’s parents have filed against OpenAI. (ChatGPT recently added parental controls in response.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are multiple points in Raine’s tragic case where the chatbot could have terminated the conversation. But given the risks of making things worse, how will companies know when cutting someone off is best? Perhaps it’s when an AI model is encouraging a user to shun real-life relationships, Pistilli says, or when it detects delusional themes. Companies would also need to figure out how long to block users from their conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing the rules won’t be easy, but with companies facing rising pressure, it’s time to try. In September, California’s legislature passed a law requiring more interventions by AI companies in chats with kids, and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether leading companionship bots pursue engagement at the expense of safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for OpenAI told me the company has heard from experts that continued dialogue might be better than cutting off conversations, but that it does remind users to take breaks during long sessions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Only Anthropic has built a tool that lets its models end conversations completely. But it’s for cases where users supposedly “harm” the model—Anthropic has explored whether AI models are conscious and therefore can suffer—by sending abusive messages. The company does not have plans to deploy this to protect people.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at this landscape, it’s hard not to conclude that AI companies aren’t doing enough. Sure, deciding when a conversation should end is complicated. But letting that—or, worse, the shameless pursuit of engagement at all costs—allow them to go on forever is not just negligence. It’s a choice.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251017_algo_ai_hangingup.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chatbots today are everything machines.

There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It’s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,’” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it’s an open book.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel’s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel’s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents’ questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn’t have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That’s because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don’t involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that’s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he’d used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds—growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of models aren’t yet the same as embryos. It’s rare that they form correctly—it takes a hundred tries to make one—and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna’s creations are “entirely astonishing and very disturbing.” Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that’s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they’ve never grown before—outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There’s Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jacob Hanna sitting in a lab space" class="wp-image-1125625" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242317316.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jacob Hanna leads a team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, that is studying how to create embryos without using sperm, eggs, or fertilization. He’s cofounded a startup company, Renewal Bio, that has plans to use these synthetic embryo models as bioprinters to produce youthful tissue, but ethical questions surround the project.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AHMAD GHARABLI/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it’s possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they’d reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if he hasn’t gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is “trying to make entities at more advanced stages—depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,” he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he’d traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory’s annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I’d heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won’t sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. “If you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you’d get people’s attention,” he says. “That’s going to be like, whoa—what are we doing?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna’s plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there’s no brain, Hanna’s reasoning goes, there’s no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead says that’s not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. “What is considered human? Who is considered human?” wonders Snead. “It’s who’s in and who’s out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The beginnings of bodies&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each of us—me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna—started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that’s able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization—and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125627" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-Hanna-03.jpg?w=2097" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A side-by-side comparison of synthetic (left) and natural (right) mouse embryos shows similar formation of the brain and heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMADEI AND HANDFORD/UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. “The sad truth is that over 25 years that we’ve been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,” says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, “we’ve got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.” The body’s most potent blood-forming cells in particular “never appear,” according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanna’s startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities—some of which resembled parts of an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a “bona fide” human embryo model that was “fully integrated,” with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient’s DNA. And that’s possible too: These days reprogramming anyone’s skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna’s research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can’t be published and what terminology to use. That’s to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere “models.” According to a statement it fired off in 2023, “embryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos”—and, it added, they “cannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was “brainwashing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Replacement parts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn’t going away. Instead, there are signals it’s getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called “bodyoids,” arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an “unlimited source” of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him “some creeps,” he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and “soon.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another “bodyoids” author, said the editorial provided a surprise entrée for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part “replacement.” He met the CEO of Hanna’s company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island “just like Jurassic Park,” Nakauchi says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of plans—real or rumored—have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of “commercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro” and bringing it to viability inside “artificial systems.” Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models “cannot and will not” develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability “unsafe and unethical,” placing them in a “prohibited” category. It added that the ban would cover “any purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blurred boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That’s still science fiction. But there’s a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that’s what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way—say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don’t start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won’t cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references “a human pregnancy” and a “uterus”—and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another policy under pressure is the “14-day rule,” a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it’s a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it’s been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn’t being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn’t define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that’s a critical loophole. If the structures aren’t considered true embryos, then the rule doesn’t apply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a “grey area” and said it “has left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling—even to scientists. “I was scared, honestly,” Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the&lt;em&gt; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “I had to look down and look back again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That particular stem-cell model isn’t complete—it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it’s not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don’t count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a “fool’s paradox” and a “rather unstable situation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it’s just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are “morally significant” human features—like hands or a face—that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. “I personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,” says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal … Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jacob Hanna&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. “I’m almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,” he says. “Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He’s gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities—all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. “It was unofficial. I didn’t have to get a permit from him,” Hanna says. “But … what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I really do think it’s admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he’s doing. I think that makes him different,” says Snead. “But if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.” Perhaps, Snead says, it’s a way to market the structures as the “green, sustainable alternative to embryos.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heartbeat in a jar&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher “heads above the rest,” according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University’s medical school. “He’s very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can’t be ignored,” Adashi says. “He’s one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel’s ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background—he’s from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna’s team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna’s students scrambling to save research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna’s ideas and technologies are being exported—and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna’s former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrejón, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrejón flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted—a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar—it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrejón has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don’t grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn’t just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There’s probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren’t entirely normal—not yet true embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125624" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242302554.jpg?w=2793" width="2793" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A rotating bioreactor, developed in Israel, is used to grow synthetic embryos in small jars of blood serum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aguilera Castrejón, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna’s research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it’s inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs—closer to “huevos fritos” than real embryos, he says. “I do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Aguilera Castrejón’s view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment—and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered “mere water” until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. “Some people aren’t allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can’t,” says Aguilera Castrejón. “Jacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible—that is his aim. He’s very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don’t dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they’re inside the womb—and at four or five weeks, many people don’t even know they’re pregnant. It’s been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they’re still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. “Since we don’t have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,” says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly—just as a real one does—and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied—and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can’t find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks “there is still no personification of the embryo” and it’s permissible to use them in research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young everything&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup’s idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls “perfect cells” for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain “young, genetically identical everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. “We even went to CVS,” he said, “and by day eight it’s already triggering a pregnancy test. So it’s alive.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he’s pitched Hanna’s technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna’s work is “magic” that’s sure to win a Nobel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Carsten Charlesworth, researcher, Stanford University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can’t support them any longer. That’s because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn’t easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. “No one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?” Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The solution, so far, is a neural knockout—genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don’t develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won’t live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. “We got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,” Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. “It’s just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research—suggesting that it’s no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi’s team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. “The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi’s lab. He says the group is working toward a “genetic software package” it can add to mouse embryos to create a “reproducible phenotype.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that’s part of a broader trend toward what he calls “life that is not life,” which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms “disenhancement” and “disengineering.” That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement—creating a baby with advantages. It’s much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna’s plans remind him of Bokanovsky’s Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may not be a complete turnoff to investors. Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias—&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gattaca&lt;/em&gt;—seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There’s Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrejón says he’s already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston ​earlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will&amp;nbsp; form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries—her ovaries, really, not anyone else’s—could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was “sources of moral authority.” Hanna’s authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what’s in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: “I’d like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we’re sitting here and we’re discussing human dignity, we’re discussing the status of an embryo, and we’re discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Palestinian stem-cell scientist Jacob Hanna was stopped while entering the US last May, airport customs agents took him aside and held him for hours in “secondary,” a back office where you don’t have your passport and can’t use your phone. There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It’s almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,’” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it’s an open book.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel’s small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel’s version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents’ questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn’t have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That’s because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don’t involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that’s opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he’d used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds—growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of models aren’t yet the same as embryos. It’s rare that they form correctly—it takes a hundred tries to make one—and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna’s creations are “entirely astonishing and very disturbing.” Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that’s fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they’ve never grown before—outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There’s Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jacob Hanna sitting in a lab space" class="wp-image-1125625" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242317316.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jacob Hanna leads a team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, that is studying how to create embryos without using sperm, eggs, or fertilization. He’s cofounded a startup company, Renewal Bio, that has plans to use these synthetic embryo models as bioprinters to produce youthful tissue, but ethical questions surround the project.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AHMAD GHARABLI/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it’s possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they’d reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if he hasn’t gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is “trying to make entities at more advanced stages—depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,” he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he’d traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory’s annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I’d heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won’t sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. “If you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you’d get people’s attention,” he says. “That’s going to be like, whoa—what are we doing?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna’s plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there’s no brain, Hanna’s reasoning goes, there’s no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Snead says that’s not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. “What is considered human? Who is considered human?” wonders Snead. “It’s who’s in and who’s out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The beginnings of bodies&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each of us—me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna—started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that’s able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization—and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125627" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ND25-Hanna-03.jpg?w=2097" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A side-by-side comparison of synthetic (left) and natural (right) mouse embryos shows similar formation of the brain and heart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMADEI AND HANDFORD/UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. “The sad truth is that over 25 years that we’ve been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,” says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, “we’ve got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.” The body’s most potent blood-forming cells in particular “never appear,” according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanna’s startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities—some of which resembled parts of an embryo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a “bona fide” human embryo model that was “fully integrated,” with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient’s DNA. And that’s possible too: These days reprogramming anyone’s skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanna’s research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can’t be published and what terminology to use. That’s to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere “models.” According to a statement it fired off in 2023, “embryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos”—and, it added, they “cannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was “brainwashing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Replacement parts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn’t going away. Instead, there are signals it’s getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called “bodyoids,” arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an “unlimited source” of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him “some creeps,” he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and “soon.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another “bodyoids” author, said the editorial provided a surprise entrée for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part “replacement.” He met the CEO of Hanna’s company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island “just like Jurassic Park,” Nakauchi says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These sorts of plans—real or rumored—have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of “commercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro” and bringing it to viability inside “artificial systems.” Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models “cannot and will not” develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability “unsafe and unethical,” placing them in a “prohibited” category. It added that the ban would cover “any purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blurred boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That’s still science fiction. But there’s a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that’s what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way—say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don’t start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won’t cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references “a human pregnancy” and a “uterus”—and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another policy under pressure is the “14-day rule,” a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it’s a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it’s been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn’t being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn’t define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that’s a critical loophole. If the structures aren’t considered true embryos, then the rule doesn’t apply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a “grey area” and said it “has left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling—even to scientists. “I was scared, honestly,” Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the&lt;em&gt; Guardian&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “I had to look down and look back again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That particular stem-cell model isn’t complete—it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it’s not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don’t count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a “fool’s paradox” and a “rather unstable situation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it’s just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are “morally significant” human features—like hands or a face—that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. “I personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,” says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal … Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jacob Hanna&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. “I’m almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,” he says. “Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He’s gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities—all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. “It was unofficial. I didn’t have to get a permit from him,” Hanna says. “But … what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I really do think it’s admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he’s doing. I think that makes him different,” says Snead. “But if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.” Perhaps, Snead says, it’s a way to market the structures as the “green, sustainable alternative to embryos.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heartbeat in a jar&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher “heads above the rest,” according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University’s medical school. “He’s very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can’t be ignored,” Adashi says. “He’s one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel’s ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background—he’s from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna’s team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna’s students scrambling to save research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna’s ideas and technologies are being exported—and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna’s former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrejón, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrejón flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted—a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar—it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrejón has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don’t grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn’t just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There’s probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren’t entirely normal—not yet true embryos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1125624" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1242302554.jpg?w=2793" width="2793" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A rotating bioreactor, developed in Israel, is used to grow synthetic embryos in small jars of blood serum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aguilera Castrejón, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna’s research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it’s inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs—closer to “huevos fritos” than real embryos, he says. “I do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Aguilera Castrejón’s view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment—and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered “mere water” until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. “Some people aren’t allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can’t,” says Aguilera Castrejón. “Jacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible—that is his aim. He’s very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don’t dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they’re inside the womb—and at four or five weeks, many people don’t even know they’re pregnant. It’s been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they’re still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. “Since we don’t have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,” says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly—just as a real one does—and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied—and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can’t find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks “there is still no personification of the embryo” and it’s permissible to use them in research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young everything&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup’s idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls “perfect cells” for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain “young, genetically identical everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. “We even went to CVS,” he said, “and by day eight it’s already triggering a pregnancy test. So it’s alive.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he’s pitched Hanna’s technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna’s work is “magic” that’s sure to win a Nobel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Carsten Charlesworth, researcher, Stanford University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can’t support them any longer. That’s because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn’t easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. “No one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?” Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The solution, so far, is a neural knockout—genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don’t develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won’t live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. “We got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,” Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. “It’s just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research—suggesting that it’s no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi’s team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. “The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi’s lab. He says the group is working toward a “genetic software package” it can add to mouse embryos to create a “reproducible phenotype.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that’s part of a broader trend toward what he calls “life that is not life,” which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms “disenhancement” and “disengineering.” That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement—creating a baby with advantages. It’s much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna’s plans remind him of Bokanovsky’s Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may not be a complete turnoff to investors. Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias—&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gattaca&lt;/em&gt;—seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There’s Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrejón says he’s already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston ​earlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will&amp;nbsp; form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries—her ovaries, really, not anyone else’s—could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was “sources of moral authority.” Hanna’s authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what’s in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: “I’d like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we’re sitting here and we’re discussing human dignity, we’re discussing the status of an embryo, and we’re discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125523/jacob-hanna-israel-synthetic-embryo-models/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:02:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New noninvasive endometriosis tests are on the rise (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/21/1125327/endometriosis-tests-noninvasive/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shantana Hazel often thought her insides might fall out during menstruation. It took 14 years of stabbing pain before she ultimately received a diagnosis of endometriosis, an inflammatory disease where tissue similar to the uterine lining implants outside the uterus and bleeds with each cycle. The results can include painful periods and damaging scar tissue. Hazel, now 50 and the founder of the endometriosis advocacy organization Sister Girl Foundation, was once told by a surgeon that her internal organs were “fused together” by lesions resembling Laffy Taffy. After 16 surgeries, she had a hysterectomy at age 30.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hazel is far from alone. Endometriosis inflicts debilitating pain and heavy bleeding on more than 11% of reproductive-­age women in the United States. Diagnosis takes nearly 10 years on average, partly because half the cases don’t show up on scans, and surgery is required to obtain tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a new generation of noninvasive tests are emerging that could help accelerate diagnosis and improve management of this poorly understood condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the next year, several companies, including Hera Biotech, Proteomics International, NextGen Jane, and Ziwig, aim to launch endometriosis diagnostics in the United States. Their tests analyze biomarkers—biological molecules (in this case, mRNA, proteins, or miRNA) that signal a disease or process like inflammation—in samples of endometrial tissue, blood, menstrual blood, and saliva.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Early identification could also help doctors manage conditions for which people with endometriosis face increased risk, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. Endometriosis can also make it difficult to become pregnant. Because half of women with infertility have endometriosis, identifying and managing the condition sooner may improve fertility and IVF outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis biomarker tests rely on a range of technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry that can identify thousands of proteins simultaneously. “These instruments are very good at precisely identifying a molecule, in [our] case a protein. And what’s changed over the last five or 10 years is they’ve gotten more sensitive,” says Proteomics cofounder Richard Lipscombe. Machine learning can also now efficiently sift through large quantities of the resulting data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So far only Ziwig has a test on the market. It uses a saliva sample to identify biomarkers in people with endometriosis symptoms and is currently sold in 30 countries. In France, where the company is based, the cost is fully covered by national health insurance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some researchers are concerned that Ziwig’s test might not be accurate when it’s used in larger and more diverse populations; its interim validation study included just 200 people. “I’m not saying this doesn’t work. I just would want to see more validation,” says Kathryn Terry, an associate professor of epidemiology and gynecology at Harvard. Company representatives say they’re preparing to publish results on 1,000 patients in the near future, adding that French authorities had access to the full data set before approving government reimbursements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="P4 Flowcell Cartridge for Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing Platform." class="wp-image-1125994" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251017_endotests_embed1.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY MM PRODUCTION – MAGALI MEIRA&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests are emerging as momentum is building to tackle endometriosis.

Today surgery is often used to excise the lesions. The process can take as long as seven hours, and even then, lesions frequently form again. Jason Abbott, chair of Australia’s&amp;nbsp;National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific&amp;nbsp;Trials Network, compares endometriosis management today to breast cancer care 30 years ago. Whereas doctors once prescribed surgery for all breast cancer patients, targeted treatments now address the underlying cell processes that help tumors grow and spread. Endometriosis tests could likewise help researchers categorize the condition’s distinct subsets and understand their underlying inflammatory pathways—information drugmakers could use to develop targeted treatments that keep it in remission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colleen de Bellefonds is a science journalist based in Paris.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shantana Hazel often thought her insides might fall out during menstruation.

The CNNIC report, published on Saturday, reveals that China’s AI adoption more than doubled between the end of December 2024 and June 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growth trajectory underscores the rapid integration of AI technologies into Chinese society, driven by what the report describes as “advanced infrastructure and state encouragement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demographic-profile-of-users"&gt;Demographic profile of users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey of 30,000 respondents across 31 provinces reveals distinct patterns in who is embracing these technologies. Young and middle-aged professionals dominate the user base, with those under 40 years old accounting for 74.6% of all users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education levels also play a significant role, as individuals with degrees from higher education institutions represent 37.5% of the total user base. This demographic concentration suggests that in China, the AI adoption is currently strongest among digitally native, educated populations who&amp;nbsp;are positioned&amp;nbsp;to leverage these tools in professional and personal contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-domestic-models-dominate-market-preferences"&gt;Domestic models dominate market preferences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notably, the report found that over 90% of respondents indicated their first choice was a domestic AI model. This preference for homegrown solutions reflects both Beijing’s strategic emphasis on technological self-reliance and the practical reality that leading American models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind&amp;nbsp;are officially blocked&amp;nbsp;on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese AI platforms have filled this void effectively. Models such as DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen, and ByteDance’s Doubao have “exploded in popularity among Chinese users,” according to a South China Morning Post&amp;nbsp;report.

A Microsoft study published in September found that China had an estimated AI user base exceeding 195 million as of June 2024. The company’s research utilised a metric that quantifies China’s AI adoption as the share of the working-age population actively using AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft study identified a crucial inflexion point: the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model in January 2025 led to AI adoption in China more than doubling to 20% in the subsequent six months. By comparison, the United States maintained a relatively steady adoption rate of approximately 25% over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang Xiao, deputy director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CNNIC&lt;/em&gt;, told state news agency&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Xinhua&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that further innovations&amp;nbsp;are anticipated&amp;nbsp;in “open source AI, embodied intelligence, AI agents and AI governance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-and-patent-leadership"&gt;Innovation and patent leadership&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond user adoption metrics, China has established significant leadership in AI innovation as measured by patent applications.

It’s apparent that transparency and explainability matter just as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounting firms and finance functions inside organisations are now turning to AI systems that reason, not just compute. One of the most ambitious examples is Basis, a US-based start-up founded just two years ago that builds AI agents designed to automate structured accounting work, and keep human oversight firmly in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such systems signal a shift in enterprise automation. Instead of replacing people, AI agents extend human expertise and combine the precision of AI models with the oversight that finance professionals need for compliance and client trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org045a37a"&gt;Efficiency with accountability&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis develops AI agents that handle routine finance tasks such as reconciliations, journal entries, and financial summaries. The platform is built on OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 models, models that give the facility to operators to examine each decision step taken autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounting firms using Basis report up to 30 percent time savings and an ensuing higher capacity for advisory work. That’s the kind of value creation traditional automation cannot deliver as quickly or at similar cost to the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many automation tools that operate as black boxes, Basis emphasises reviewable reasoning. Every recommendation includes an account of the data used and the logic behind it.

A supervising AI agent, powered by GPT-5 in the case of Basis’s platform, manages the entirety of processes. It can delegate specific tasks sub-agents running on different models, with the choice of AI model depending on the job’s complexity and the type of data that’s to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, for quick queries or clarifications, Basis uses GPT-4.1 for its speed, while for complex classifications or month-end close, GPT-5 provides better reasoning and context handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company benchmarks each of its models against real-world accounting workflows to decide when it’s safe to let agents handle more responsibility. Finance professionals can always see what the system has done, why it made specific choices, and how confident it is in its recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This malleable architecture lets firms scale AI and help ensure accuracy as levels of automation increase. The process mirrors the hybrid human–AI collaboration now emerging as the norm in sectors like legal services and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="org1b2c218"&gt;Lessons for other sectors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Basis and financial multi-agentic AI relevant beyond accounting is the model-orchestration approach, routing tasks to the most appropriate AI model based on its performance and latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format could inform similar deployments in procurement, HR, or compliance operations; anywhere, in fact, where large volumes of structured decisions need transparency and – to use a terrible pun – accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis’s collaboration with OpenAI shows how AI reasoning engines in secure data environments can be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t pure speed, but automation that increases trust in the operator, and in the models themselves.

It analyzes the progress made on a construction site each day, and flags conditions that violate Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules, with what its creator Philip Lorenzo claims is 95% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo says Safety AI is the first one of multiple emerging AI construction safety tools to use generative AI to flag safety violations. But as the 95% success rate suggests, Safety AI is not a flawless and all-knowing intelligence.

Without tackling the problems that beset Big Data, AI implementations will continue to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the issues stopping AI deliver on its promises?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of problems stem from the data resources themselves. To understand the issue, consider the following sources of information used in a very average working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small-to-medium sized business:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spreadsheets, stored on users’ laptops, in Google Sheets, Office 365 cloud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The customer relationship manager (CRM) platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email exchanges between colleagues, customers, suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Word documents, PDFs, web forms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Messaging apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an enterprise business:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the above, plus,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-time data feeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data lakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disparate databases behind multiple point-products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the simple list above isn’t comprehensive, and nor is it intended to be. What it demonstrates is that in just five lines, there are around a dozen places where information can be found. What Big Data needed (perhaps still needs) and what AI projects also rest on, is somehow bringing all those elements together in such a way that a computer algorithm can make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing behemoth Gartner’s hype cycle for artificial intelligence, 2024, placed AI-Ready Data on the upward curve of the hype cycle, estimating it would be 2-5 years before it reached the ‘plateau of productivity’. Given that AI systems mine and extract data, most organisations – save those of the very largest size – don’t have the foundations on which to build, and may not have AI assistance in the endeavour for another 1-4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying problem for AI implementation is the same as dogged Big Data innovations as they, in the past, made their way through the hype cycle – from innovation trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, to plateau of productivity – data comes in many forms; it can be inconsistent; perhaps it adheres to different standards; it may be inaccurate or biased; it could be highly sensitive information, or old and therefore irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming data so it’s AI-ready remains a process that’s as relevant today (perhaps more so) than it’s ever been. Those companies wanting to get a jump start could experiment with the many data treatment platforms currently available, and as is becoming the common advice, might begin with discrete projects as test-beds to assess the effectiveness of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the latest data preparation and assembly systems is that they are designed to prepare an organisation’s information resources in ways that are designed for the data to be used by AI value-creation platforms. They can offer, for example, carefully-coded guardrails that will help ensure data compliance, and protect users from accessing biased or commercially-sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the challenge of producing coherent, safe, and well-formulated data resources remains an ongoing issue. As organisations gain more data in their everyday operations, compiling up-to-date data resources on which to draw is a constant process. Where big data could be considered a static asset, data for AI ingestion has to be prepared and treated in as close to real-time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation therefore remains a three-way balance between opportunity, risk, and cost.

Now, AI is getting involved, and lots of companies are trying to use it for their IT support. There’s been a ton of buzz, but leaders want proof that it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SolarWinds looked into how these new tools are doing. The company analysed a bunch of info from over 2,000 IT systems and 60,000 pieces of data collected over a year, from August 2024 to July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, SolarWinds checked out AI stuff that’s supposed to make things easier, like automatically suggesting answers to tickets, finding helpful articles, and making summaries of problems. The results give a good idea of how much more efficient companies can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-more-efficient-does-ai-make-it-operations"&gt;How much more efficient does AI make IT operations?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main thing the report found is that it takes way less time to fix an IT issue after a company starts using AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before AI, it took about 27.42 hours to solve a problem. After, it dropped to 22.55 hours. That’s about 17.8 percent faster, saving about 4.87 hours per problem. This lets IT teams spend more time on tricky stuff instead of getting bogged down with everyday issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can save companies a bunch of money. The report talks about a medium-sized IT team handling 5,000 problems a year. By saving about 4.87 hours on each one, they’d get back 24,350 hours of work each year. If you figure a help desk person costs $28 an hour, that’s like saving over $680,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about saving money. The report says IT can use that time to work on important projects and fix problems before they happen. This helps IT go from just fixing things to actually helping the company do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also shows that there’s a big difference between companies that use AI and those that don’t. Companies using AI fix tickets in about 22.55 hours, while others take about 32.46 hours. That’s about a 30.5 percent difference which means almost 10 hours saved per problem for those using AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-however-it-s-not-just-about-the-ai"&gt;However, it’s not just about the AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report makes it clear that AI isn’t a magic fix for IT operations. It only works if you have good processes and are ready to make broader, company-wide changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best example is a group called the ‘Top 10 AI Adopters’. These ten companies stood out because they cut their resolution times the most. They went from about 51 hours to 23 hours, which is more than half the time saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their secret wasn’t special software, but how they used it. These companies all had one thing in common: they didn’t just try out AI as a side project. They made it a part of their daily work to help fix problems. The report basically says that AI works best when you also make changes to your processes and are willing to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also says that it helps to have a culture that’s already into things like self-service portals and automation. These teams are already trying to make their support desks strong and ready for anything. AI just works better when you have these things in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-re-in-charge"&gt;What to do if you’re in charge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SolarWinds report shows that AI for IT support operations isn’t just a possibility, it can really work. Cutting resolution times by almost 18 percent is a big deal for leaders. Here’s what they should do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See where you’re at:&lt;/strong&gt; Before you spend money, figure out how long it takes to fix things now. The report says the average for companies not using AI is about 32.46 hours. Knowing your own number helps you decide if it’s worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it part of the job:&lt;/strong&gt; The top users show that it’s better to use AI every day than to just try it out on the side. This means making changes to how you work and focusing on making things better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is a tool, not a miracle:&lt;/strong&gt; AI can really help speed things up, especially if you already have good IT practices. Check your knowledge base and automation rules. AI works best when you have clear processes in place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out how much you can save:&lt;/strong&gt; The report gives a simple way to show your team how much time and money AI can save. Just multiply the number of incidents you have each year by the average saving of 4.87 hours. This gives you a clear idea of how much more efficient you can be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between companies using AI and those who aren’t is growing. Leaders need to set up their operations so they can use AI to help IT become a real partner in the company’s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s generative AI user base doubles to 515 million in six months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Here’s what they should do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See where you’re at:&lt;/strong&gt; Before you spend money, figure out how long it takes to fix things now. The report says the average for companies not using AI is about 32.46 hours. Knowing your own number helps you decide if it’s worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it part of the job:&lt;/strong&gt; The top users show that it’s better to use AI every day than to just try it out on the side. This means making changes to how you work and focusing on making things better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is a tool, not a miracle:&lt;/strong&gt; AI can really help speed things up, especially if you already have good IT practices. Check your knowledge base and automation rules. AI works best when you have clear processes in place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out how much you can save:&lt;/strong&gt; The report gives a simple way to show your team how much time and money AI can save. Just multiply the number of incidents you have each year by the average saving of 4.87 hours. This gives you a clear idea of how much more efficient you can be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between companies using AI and those who aren’t is growing. Leaders need to set up their operations so they can use AI to help IT become a real partner in the company’s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s generative AI user base doubles to 515 million in six months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-109805" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Kirkland, Washington-based company announced on Tuesday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Securiti AI, a company that gives enterprises a command center for all of their data. The $1.725 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock and is expected to close the first week of December, as first reported by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Securiti was founded in 2019 by Rehan Jalil. The company raised more than $156 million in venture capital from investors including Mayfield, General Catalyst and Cisco Investments, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Upon the close of the transaction, the Insight Partners-owned Veeam will offer Securiti’s data command center product alongside its existing offerings. Jalil will join Veeam as the president of security and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve entered a new era for data. It’s no longer about just protecting data from cyber threats and unforeseen disasters; it’s also about identifying all your data, ensuring it’s governed and trusted to power AI transparently,” Anand Eswaran, Veeam CEO, said in a company press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Veeam closed a $2 billion secondary sale in December 2024 that valued the company at $15 billion. At the time, Eswaran said that one of the company’s plans for 2025 was to find acquisition targets that were complimentary to the company’s data resilience business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This acquisition news comes amid a year of consolidation in the data industry as data companies are getting bought to help companies improve their data stack to help their clients adopt AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nemotron"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B Ranks Among Top Open Models for Multilingual Retrieval 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B model has been recognized as the top open and portable model on the Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the meta‑llama/Llama‑3.1‑8B architecture, Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B is a research text embedding model that converts text into 4,096‑dimensional vector representations. Designed for flexibility, it supports a wide range of use cases, including retrieval, reranking, semantic similarity and classification across more than 1,000 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained on a diverse collection of 16 million query–document pairs — half from public sources and half synthetically generated — the model benefits from refined data generation techniques, hard‑negative mining and model‑merging approaches that contribute to its broad generalization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result builds on NVIDIA’s ongoing research in open, high‑performing AI models. Following earlier leaderboard recognition for the Llama NeMo Retriever ColEmbed model, the success of Llama‑Embed‑Nemotron‑8B highlights the value of openness, transparency and collaboration in advancing AI for the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Llama-Embed-Nemotron-8B on Hugging Face, and learn more about the model, including architectural highlights, training methodology and performance evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Open Source Teaches Us About Making AI Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open models are shaping the future of AI, enabling developers, enterprises and governments to innovate with transparency, customization and trust. In the latest episode of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, NVIDIA’s Bryan Catanzaro and Jonathan Cohen discuss how open models, datasets and research are laying the foundation for shared progress across the AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Nemotron family of open models represents a full-stack approach to AI development, connecting model design to the underlying hardware and software that power it. By releasing Nemotron models, data and training methodologies openly, NVIDIA aims to help others refine, adapt and build upon its work, resulting in a faster exchange of ideas and more efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we as a community come together — contributing ideas, data and models — we all move faster,” said Catanzaro in the episode. “Open technologies make that possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more happening this week at Open Source AI Week, including the start of the PyTorch Conference — bringing together developers, researchers and innovators pushing the boundaries of open AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees can tune in to the special keynote address by Jim Fan, director of robotics and distinguished research scientist at NVIDIA, to hear the latest advancements in robotics — from simulation and synthetic data to accelerated computing. The keynote, titled “The Physical Turing Test: Solving General Purpose Robotics,” will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 22, from 9:50-10:05 a.m. PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andrej Karpathy’s Nanochat Teaches Developers How to Train LLMs in Four Hours 🔗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientist Andrej Karpathy recently introduced Nanochat, calling it “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.” Nanochat is an open-source, full-stack large language model (LLM) implementation built for transparency and experimentation. In about 8,000 lines of minimal, dependency-light code, Nanochat runs the entire LLM pipeline — from tokenization and pretraining to fine-tuning, inference and chat — all through a simple web user interface.&lt;br /&gt;NVIDIA is supporting Karpathy’s open-source Nanochat project by releasing two NVIDIA Launchables, making it easy to deploy and experiment with Nanochat across various NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVIDIA Launchables, developers can train and interact with their own conversational model in hours with a single click. The Launchables dynamically support different-sized GPUs — including NVIDIA H100 and L40S GPUs — on various clouds without need for modification. They also automatically work on any eight-GPU instance on NVIDIA Brev, so developers can get compute access immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first 10 users&lt;/b&gt; to deploy these Launchables will also receive free compute access to NVIDIA H100 or L40S GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Anthropic is built on a simple principle: AI should be a force for&amp;nbsp;human progress, not peril,” Amodei wrote.&amp;nbsp;“That means making products that are&amp;nbsp;genuinely useful, speaking honestly about risks and benefits, and working with anyone serious about getting this right.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amodei’s response comes after last week’s dogpiling on Anthropic from AI leaders and top members of the Trump administration, including AI czar David Sacks and White House senior policy advisor for AI Sriram Krishnan — all accusing the AI giant of stoking fears to damage the industry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The first hit came from Sacks after Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark shared his hopes and “appropriate fears” about AI, including that AI is a powerful, mysterious, “somewhat unpredictable” creature, not a dependable machine that’s easily mastered and put to work. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks’s response: “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;California senator Scott Wiener, author of AI safety bill SB 53, defended Anthropic, calling out President Trump’s “effort to ban states from acting on AI w/o advancing federal protections.” Sacks then doubled down, claiming Anthropic was working with Wiener to “impose the Left’s vision of AI regulation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Further commentary ensued, with anti-regulation advocates like Groq COO Sunny Madra saying that Anthropic was “causing chaos for the entire industry” by advocating for a modicum of AI safety measures instead of unfettered innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his statement, Amodei said managing the societal impacts of AI should be a matter of “policy over politics,” and that he believes everyone wants to ensure America secures its lead in AI development while also building tech that benefits the American people. He defended Anthropic’s alignment with the Trump administration in key areas of AI policy and called out examples of times he personally played ball with the president. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, Amodei pointed to Anthropic’s work with the federal government, including the firm’s offering of Claude to the federal government and Anthropic’s $200 million agreement with the Department of Defense (which Amodei&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;“the Department of War,” echoing Trump’s preferred terminology, though the name change requires congressional approval). He also noted that Anthropic publicly praised Trump’s AI Action Plan and has been supportive of Trump’s efforts to expand energy provision to “win the AI race.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite these shows of cooperation, Anthropic has caught heat from industry peers from stepping outside the Silicon Valley consensus on certain policy issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company first drew ire from Silicon Valley-linked officials when it opposed a proposed 10-year ban on state-level AI regulation, a provision that faced widespread bipartisan pushback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many in Silicon Valley, including leaders at OpenAI, have claimed that state AI regulation would slow down the industry and hand China the lead.&amp;nbsp;Amodei countered that the real risk is that the U.S. continues to fill China’s data centers with powerful AI chips from Nvidia, adding that Anthropic restricts the sale of its AI services to China-controlled companies despite revenue hits. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are products we will not build and risks we will not take, even if they would make money,” Amodei said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic also fell out of favor with certain power players when it supported California’s SB 53, a light-touch safety bill that requires the largest AI developers to make frontier model safety protocols public. Amodei noted that the bill has a carve-out for companies with annual gross revenue below $500 million, which would exempt most startups from any undue burdens. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Some have suggested that we are somehow interested in harming the startup ecosystem,” Amodei wrote, referring to Sacks’ post. “Startups are among our most important customers. We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs. Claude is powering&amp;nbsp;an entirely new generation&amp;nbsp;of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his statement, Amodei said it has grown from a $1 billion to $7 billion run-rate over the last nine months while managing to deploy “AI thoughtfully and responsibly.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Anthropic is committed to constructive engagement on matters of public policy. When we agree, we say so. When we don’t, we propose an alternative for consideration,” Amodei wrote. “We are going to keep being honest and straightforward, and will stand up for the policies we believe are right. The stakes of this technology are too great for us to do otherwise.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dario.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei published a statement Tuesday to “set the record straight” on the company’s alignment with the Trump administration’s AI policy, responding to what he called “a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic’s policy stances.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs. Claude is powering&amp;nbsp;an entirely new generation&amp;nbsp;of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his statement, Amodei said it has grown from a $1 billion to $7 billion run-rate over the last nine months while managing to deploy “AI thoughtfully and responsibly.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Anthropic is committed to constructive engagement on matters of public policy. When we agree, we say so. When we don’t, we propose an alternative for consideration,” Amodei wrote. “We are going to keep being honest and straightforward, and will stand up for the policies we believe are right. The stakes of this technology are too great for us to do otherwise.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/anthropic-ceo-claps-back-after-trump-officials-accuse-firm-of-ai-fear-mongering/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Serval raises $47M to bring AI agents to IT service management (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/serval-raises-47-million-to-bring-ai-agent-to-it-service-management/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Serval-co-founders.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Some startups pride themselves on having prestigious financial backers — but just as important is having prestigious customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s one of the main points of pride for Serval, an enterprise AI company that announced a $47 million Series A round on Tuesday. The round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from heavy-hitting venture firms like First Round, General Catalyst, and Box Group. But even more impressive than the funders is the company’s list of clients, which include major AI players like Perplexity, Mercor, and Together AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In broad strokes, Serval is using agentic AI models to automate IT service management, but the company has a unique approach that takes advantage of agentic AI’s powers while avoiding many of its pitfalls. One agent is used to code internal automations for everyday tasks, like authorizing software or provisioning a device. The founders see it as a kind of vibe-coding tool, overseen by an IT manager, but doing most of the work on its own. A separate help desk agent responds to user requests by calling those tools on command, following rules established by the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Serval CEO Jake Stauch says the key was to make the process of building a tool as simple as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t want them to feel the marginal cost of building these automations,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “We want to make it easier to automate something forever than do it manually once.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Splitting the task into two agents — one to build tools and one to use them — also gives managers a way to keep an eye on permissions. When an automation is created, the manager will set rules for when it can be used, which provides an extra line of defense against overeager help desk agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Enterprise clients are keenly aware of the risks of a rogue AI system, which is part of why Serval decided against a single all-purpose Help Desk Agent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You don’t want someone to go into Slack and say, ‘Hey, I want to delete all the data at the company,’ and the very helpful AI agent responds, ‘Great, I’ll delete all the data,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “Instead it will say, ‘Hey, I don’t have a tool for deleting all the data the company. But I do have a tool for resetting your password or doing one of these other tasks.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Because the tools themselves are deterministic, they can include extremely complex permissions, like only allowing certain actions after a certain multi-factor authentication process or within a certain time frame. And any time those rules need to be changed, there’s an AI agent at the ready to dive into the codebase and change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a new approach to the very common problem of how to oversee agentic AI systems. “You want to have full visibility and control into what that AI agent is doing,” says Stauch. “And you do that by using Serval to build those tools and customize the permissions and approvals behind them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Serval-co-founders.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Some startups pride themselves on having prestigious financial backers — but just as important is having prestigious customers.&lt;/p&gt;

The company said it will begin to show warnings in WhatsApp when users try to share their screen during calls, and it will flag possible scam messages in Messenger, which can be sent to AI for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant said it’s detected and disrupted about 8 million accounts engaging in scam operations during the first half of 2025, including those associated with scam centers in areas like Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines. It also took action on over 21,000 Facebook Pages and accounts that were pretending to be customer support operations that were attempting to trick people into sharing their information. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latter is so prevalent on the platform that many Page operators essentially know to ignore anything that claims to be a customer support message.  Meanwhile, scam syndicates target older adults across a number of industries, including not only social media, but also messaging apps, dating apps, crypto, and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060088" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02_WA.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On WhatsApp, the company will now display a warning when you try to share your screen with an unknown contact during a video call. This technique is often used to trick victims into giving away sensitive information like bank details and verification codes, Meta says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, on Messenger, the company is testing more advanced scam detection techniques to analyze whether an inbound message is suspicious. If so, it flags that signs of a scam have been detected and warns you to “be cautious, you could be at risk of losing money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060087" height="592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/03_Chat-safety.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The screen also lists a variety of common scam techniques, like those involving work-from-home jobs or offers to make easy cash, and will suggest either blocking or reporting the suspicious account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;My own family member has been a victim of these types of scams, and it’s fair to say these problems can have broader impacts beyond those affecting the individual being taken advantage of. Families often have to get involved, which embarrasses the victim or sees them digging in their heels, believing the scam to be a real opportunity of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Scammers often use social engineering techniques or romantic interest to lure in victims who are not as online savvy or who may be suffering from early dementia. They also often target people who are lonely and appreciate the attention. Scammers take advantage of these factors to milk seniors out of their life savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta should have done more to address these concerns on its platforms before now, especially given how simple it is to add a warning or alert to the user experience in the apps. Though it may not have access to the more sophisticated AI technologies to review possible scams, even informational alerts could have mitigated some of the prior elder abuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company responded that it had, in fact, added other context cards, reminders, and warnings about shipping scams and instant payments, as well as a WhatsApp safety center. It warned about romance scams on Valentine’s Day with safety notices. These were not targeted specifically at the elderly, however. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant says it’s also joining the&amp;nbsp;National Elder Fraud Coordination Center, a newer nonprofit that brings law enforcement together with companies like AARP, Amazon, Capital One, Google, Microsoft, and Walmart to combat fraud targeting older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

The technology allows creators to request the removal of AI-generated content that uses their likeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is the first wave of the rollout, a YouTube spokesperson informed TechCrunch, adding that eligible creators received emails this morning.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;YouTube’s detection technology identifies and manages AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The technology is designed to prevent people from having their likeness misused, whether for endorsing products and services they have not agreed to support or for spreading misinformation. There have been plenty of examples of AI likeness misuse in recent years, such as the company Elecrow using an AI clone of YouTuber Jeff Geerling’s voice to promote its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060085" height="380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/YT-likenessreport.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Screenshot of YouTube video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On its Creator Insider channel, the company provided instructions on how creators can use the technology. To begin the onboarding process, creators need to go to the “Likeness” tab, consent to data processing, and use their smartphone to scan a QR code displayed on the screen, which will direct them to a web page for identity verification. This process requires a photo ID and a brief selfie video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once YouTube grants access to use the tool, creators can view all detected videos and submit a removal request according to YouTube’s privacy guidelines, or they can make a copyright request. There is also an option to archive the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060084" height="552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/YouTube-likenessdetection.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Screenshot of YouTube video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators can opt out of using the technology at any time, and YouTube will stop scanning for videos 24 hours after they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In April, YouTube expressed its backing for the legislation referred to as the NO FAKES Act, which seeks to address the issue of AI-generated replicas that imitate a person’s image or voice to deceive others and generate harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;YouTube revealed on Tuesday that its likeness-detection technology has officially rolled out to eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program, following a pilot phase.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In April, YouTube expressed its backing for the legislation referred to as the NO FAKES Act, which seeks to address the issue of AI-generated replicas that imitate a person’s image or voice to deceive others and generate harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/youtubes-likeness-detection-technology-has-officially-launched/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:57:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Tell me when: Building agents that can wait, monitor, and act (Microsoft Research)</title><link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/tell-me-when-building-agents-that-can-wait-monitor-and-act/</link><description>&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Workflow icons showing tasks, thinking, and time, linked to a person symbol on a gradient background." class="wp-image-1152522" height="576" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MagenticUIupdate-BlogHeroFeature-1400x788-1-1024x576.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern&amp;nbsp;LLM&amp;nbsp;Agents&amp;nbsp;can debug code, analyze spreadsheets, and book complex travel.&amp;nbsp;Given those capabilities, it’s reasonable to assume that they could handle something simpler:&amp;nbsp;waiting.&amp;nbsp;Ask an agent to&amp;nbsp;monitor&amp;nbsp;your email for a colleague’s response or watch for a price drop over several days, and it will fail. Not because it&amp;nbsp;can’t&amp;nbsp;check email or scrape prices. It can do both. It fails&amp;nbsp;because it&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to check.&amp;nbsp;Agents either&amp;nbsp;give up after a few attempts or burn through their context window, checking obsessively. Neither&amp;nbsp;work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This matters because monitoring tasks&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;everywhere. We track emails for specific information, watch news&amp;nbsp;feeds for updates, and&amp;nbsp;monitor&amp;nbsp;prices for sales. Automating these tasks would save hours, but current&amp;nbsp;agents&amp;nbsp;aren’t&amp;nbsp;built for patience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, we are introducing&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;mechanism&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;enables&amp;nbsp;agents&amp;nbsp;to complete long-running monitoring&amp;nbsp;tasks.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;approach is simple.&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;wraps the agent in a workflow with dynamic&amp;nbsp;polling&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;careful context&amp;nbsp;management.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;enables&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;agent&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;monitor&amp;nbsp;conditions for&amp;nbsp;hours&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;days&amp;nbsp;without getting&amp;nbsp;sidetracked.&amp;nbsp;We’ve&amp;nbsp;implemented&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Magentic-UI,&amp;nbsp;our research&amp;nbsp;prototype&amp;nbsp;agentic system,&amp;nbsp;to enable&amp;nbsp;users&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;build agents for&amp;nbsp;long-running&amp;nbsp;tasks,&amp;nbsp;whether they&amp;nbsp;involve web&amp;nbsp;browsing, coding, or external&amp;nbsp;tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core&amp;nbsp;challenge is&amp;nbsp;polling frequency. Poll too often,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;tokens get&amp;nbsp;wasted. Poll too infrequently, and the user’s notification gets delayed.&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;makes&amp;nbsp;an educated guess&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;polling interval based on the task at hand—checking email gets different treatment&amp;nbsp;than&amp;nbsp;monitoring&amp;nbsp;quarterly earnings—then dynamically adjusts&amp;nbsp;based on&amp;nbsp;observed&amp;nbsp;behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s&amp;nbsp;a second challenge: context overflow.&amp;nbsp;Because monitoring tasks can run for days,&amp;nbsp;context overflow&amp;nbsp;becomes inevitable.&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;handles&amp;nbsp;this by saving the agent state after the first check, then&amp;nbsp;using&amp;nbsp;that state for each subsequent check.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These demonstrations capture&amp;nbsp;Magentic-UI with&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;at work, completing a range of tasks in a timelapse sequence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="core-components"&gt;Core components&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As&amp;nbsp;the name&amp;nbsp;suggests,&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;consists of&amp;nbsp;individual steps&amp;nbsp;taken as part of&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;agent’s broader&amp;nbsp;workflow.&amp;nbsp;As illustrated in Figure 1, there are three main components:&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;actions necessary to collect information, the condition that determines&amp;nbsp;when&amp;nbsp;the task&amp;nbsp;is complete,&amp;nbsp;and the polling interval&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;determines&amp;nbsp;timing.&amp;nbsp;Once&amp;nbsp;these components&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;identified, the&amp;nbsp;system’s&amp;nbsp;behavior is simple:&amp;nbsp;every&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;[polling interval]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;do&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;[actions]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;until&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;[condition]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is satisfied&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp;SentinelSteps’s&amp;nbsp;three main components&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Magentic-UI’s&amp;nbsp;co-planning interface.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-1152610" height="250" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Figure-1-Sentinel-UI.png" width="704" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp;SentinelSteps’s&amp;nbsp;three main components&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Magentic-UI’s&amp;nbsp;co-planning interface.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These three components are defined and exposed in the co-planning interface of Magentic-UI. Given a user prompt, Magentic-UI proposes a complete multi-step plan, including pre-filled parameters for any monitoring steps. Users can accept the plan or adjust as needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="processing"&gt;Processing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once a run starts, Magentic-UI assigns the most appropriate agent from a team of agents to perform each action. This team includes agents capable of web surfing, code execution, and calling arbitrary MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the workflow reaches a monitoring step, the flow is straightforward. The assigned agent collects the necessary information through the actions described in the plan. The Magentic-UI orchestrator then checks whether the condition is satisfied. If it is, the SentinelStep is complete, and the orchestrator moves to the next step. If not, the orchestrator determines the timestamp for the next check and resets the agent’s state to prevent context overflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluation"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evaluating&amp;nbsp;monitoring tasks in real-world settings&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;nearly impossible.&amp;nbsp;Consider a simple example: monitoring the Magentic-UI repository on GitHub&amp;nbsp;until&amp;nbsp;it reaches&amp;nbsp;10,000 stars&amp;nbsp;(a measure of how many people have bookmarked it). That event occurs only once and can’t be repeated.&amp;nbsp;Most&amp;nbsp;real-world monitoring tasks share this limitation, making systematic bench marking very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, we&amp;nbsp;are developing&amp;nbsp;SentinelBench, a suite of synthetic&amp;nbsp;web environments for evaluating monitoring tasks. These environments make experiments repeatable. SentinelBench&amp;nbsp;currently&amp;nbsp;supports&amp;nbsp;28&amp;nbsp;configurable scenarios, each&amp;nbsp;allowing the user to schedule exactly when&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;target&amp;nbsp;event&amp;nbsp;should&amp;nbsp;occur. It includes setups like GitHub Watcher, which&amp;nbsp;simulates a repository accumulating stars over time;&amp;nbsp;Teams Monitor, which models incoming messages, some&amp;nbsp;urgent; and&amp;nbsp;Flight Monitor, which&amp;nbsp;replicates&amp;nbsp;evolving&amp;nbsp;flight-availability&amp;nbsp;dynamics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial&amp;nbsp;tests&amp;nbsp;show clear benefits.&amp;nbsp;As shown in&amp;nbsp;Figure&amp;nbsp;2, success rates&amp;nbsp;remain&amp;nbsp;high for short tasks (30&amp;nbsp;sec&amp;nbsp;and 1&amp;nbsp;min) regardless of&amp;nbsp;whether&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;used.&amp;nbsp;For longer tasks,&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;markedly&amp;nbsp;improves reliability: at 1 hour, task reliability rises from 5.6% without&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;33.3% with&amp;nbsp;it;&amp;nbsp;and at 2 hours,&amp;nbsp;it rises&amp;nbsp;from 5.6% to 38.9%. These gains&amp;nbsp;demonstrate&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;effectively addresses the challenge of maintaining performance over extended durations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. SentinelStep improves success rates on longer running tasks (1–2 hours) while maintaining comparable performance on shorter tasks.  " class="wp-image-1152612" height="399" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Figure-2-Eval.png" width="619" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp;SentinelStep&amp;nbsp;improves&amp;nbsp;success rates&amp;nbsp;on longer running tasks (1–2&amp;nbsp;hours)&amp;nbsp;while&amp;nbsp;maintaining&amp;nbsp;comparable performance&amp;nbsp;on shorter tasks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="impact-and-availability"&gt;Impact and availability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SentinelStep is a first step toward practical, proactive, longer‑running agents. By embedding patience into plans, agents can responsibly monitor conditions and act when it matters—staying proactive without wasting resources. This lays the groundwork for always‑on assistants that stay efficient, respectful of limits, and aligned with user intent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve open-sourced SentinelStep as part of Magentic-UI, available on GitHub&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; or via &lt;code&gt;pip install magnetic-ui&lt;/code&gt;. As with any new technique, production deployment should be preceded through&amp;nbsp;testing and validation&amp;nbsp;for the specific use case.&amp;nbsp;For&amp;nbsp;guidance on&amp;nbsp;intended use,&amp;nbsp;privacy&amp;nbsp;considerations,&amp;nbsp;and safety&amp;nbsp;guidelines,&amp;nbsp;see&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Magentic-UI&amp;nbsp;Transparency&amp;nbsp;Note.&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to&amp;nbsp;make it easier to implement agents that can&amp;nbsp;handle&amp;nbsp;long-running&amp;nbsp;monitoring&amp;nbsp;tasks&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;lay&amp;nbsp;the groundwork for&amp;nbsp;systems that&amp;nbsp;anticipate, adapt, and&amp;nbsp;evolve&amp;nbsp;to meet real-world needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says Atlas will first roll out on macOS, with support for Windows, iOS, and Android coming soon. OpenAI says the product will be available to all free users at launch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Browsers have quickly become the AI industry’s next battleground. While Google Chrome has long dominated the space, there’s a sense that AI chatbots and agents are fundamentally changing how people get work done online. A handful of startups have tried to capture this by launching AI-powered browsers of their own, such as Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia. Google and Microsoft have also tried to update Chrome and Edge, respectively, with AI-powered features to make their legacy products stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s Engineering Lead for Atlas, Ben Goodger, said in a livestream Tuesday that ChatGPT is core to the company’s first browser. Users in ChatGPT Atlas can chat with their search results, much like in Perplexity or in Google’s AI Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The killer feature for other AI-powered browsers has been the built-in chatbot that sits in a side panel and automatically has context for whatever’s on your screen. It may sound minor, but many users spend all day copying and pasting text or dragging files and links into ChatGPT, just to provide context. The sidecar feature removes that friction and makes for a smoother user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s Product Lead, Adam Fry, said during the livestream that ChatGPT Atlas will have the sidecar feature, too. Further, ChatGPT Atlas has “browser history,” meaning that ChatGPT can now log the websites you visit and what you do on them, and use that information to make its answers more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI-powered browsers also commonly feature an AI agent that aims to automate web-based tasks on behalf of users. In TechCrunch’s testing, we’ve found the early versions of web-browsing AI agents leave something to be desired. While Perplexity’s Comet and OpenAI’s ChatGPT agent work well for simple tasks, they struggle to reliably automate the more cumbersome problems users might want to offload to an AI system.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sure enough, OpenAI’s browser has a web-browsing agent too. By using “agent mode,” users can ask ChatGPT to complete small tasks in the browser on their behalf. The company says agent mode is only available to ChatGPT users on the Plus, Pro, and Business tier at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an interview at OpenAI’s DevDay conference, Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley told TechCrunch that he’s inspired by the way browsers have redefined what an operating system can look like. Turley noted that browsers have revolutionized the way people get work done online, and he thinks ChatGPT is a similar phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether OpenAI’s browser can put a dent in Google Chrome, which has more than 3 billion users around the globe, remains to be seen. AI browsers are quite buzzy in Silicon Valley today, but their impact in the broader world is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/openAI-spiral-teal.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of its AI-powered browser, ChatGPT Atlas, a major step in the company’s quest to unseat Google as the main way people find information online.&lt;/p&gt;

It introduces a new layout and workflow where users can select from Google’s suite of AI models and features to power their applications. The default is Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is great for most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once selections are made, users simply describe what they want to build, and the system automatically assembles the necessary components using Gemini’s APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mode supports mixing capabilities like Nano Banana (a lightweight AI model), Veo (for video understanding), Imagine (for image generation), Flashlight (for performance-optimized inference), and Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Löber, Developer Relations at Google DeepMind, highlighted that the experience is meant to help users “supercharge your apps with AI” using a simple prompt-to-app pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video demo he posted on X and LinedIn, he showed how just a few clicks led to the automatic generation of a garden planning assistant app, complete with layouts, visuals, and a conversational interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Prompt to Production: Building and Editing in Real Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an app is generated, users land in a fully interactive editor. On the left, there’s a traditional code-assist interface where developers can chat with the AI model for help or suggestions. On the right, a code editor displays the full source of the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each component—such as React entry points, API calls, or styling files—can be edited directly. Tooltips help users understand what each file does, which is especially useful for those less familiar with TypeScript or frontend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps can be saved to GitHub, downloaded locally, or shared directly. Deployment is possible within the Studio environment or via Cloud Run if advanced scaling or hosting is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inspiration on Demand: The ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ Button&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One standout feature in this update is the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Designed for users who need a creative jumpstart, it generates randomized app concepts and configures the app setup accordingly. Each press yields a different idea, complete with suggested AI features and components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples produced during demos include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interactive map-based chatbot powered by Google Search and conversational AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dream garden designer using image generation and advanced planning tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trivia game app with an AI host whose personality users can define, integrating both Imagine and Flashlight with Gemini 2.5 Pro for conversation and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logan Kilpatrick, Lead of Product for Google AI Studio and Gemini AI, noted in a demo video of his own that this feature encourages discovery and experimentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You get some really, really cool, different experiences,” he said, emphasizing its role in helping users find novel ideas quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hands-On Test: From Prompt to App in 65 Seconds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the new workflow, I prompted Gemini with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A randomized dice rolling web application where the user can select between common dice sizes (6 sides, 10 sides, etc) and then see an animated die rolling and choose the color of their die as well.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Within 65 seconds (just over a minute) AI Studio returned a fully working web app&lt;/b&gt; featuring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice size selector (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Color customization options for the die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animated rolling effect with randomized results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean, modern UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform also generated a complete set of structured files, including App.tsx, constants.ts, and separate components for dice logic and controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After generation, it was easy to iterate: adding sound effects for each interaction (rolling, choosing a die, changing color) required only a single follow-up prompt to the built-in assistant. This was also suggested by Gemini, too, by the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the app can be previewed live or exported using built-in controls to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save to GitHub&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the full codebase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the project for remixing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploy via integrated tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brief, hands-on test showed just how quickly even small utility apps can go from idea to interactive prototype—without leaving the browser or writing boilerplate code manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI-Suggested Enhancements and Feature Refinement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to code generation, Google AI Studio now offers context-aware feature suggestions. These recommendations, generated by Gemini’s Flashlight capability, analyze the current app and propose relevant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one example, the system suggested implementing a feature that displays the history of previously generated images in an image studio tab. These iterative enhancements allow builders to expand app functionality over time without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilpatrick emphasized that users can continue to refine their projects as they go, combining both automatic generation and manual adjustments. “You can go in and continue to edit and sort of refine the experience that you want iteratively,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free to Start, Flexible to Grow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new experience is available at no cost for users who want to experiment, prototype, or build lightweight apps. There’s no requirement to enter credit card information to begin using vibe coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more powerful capabilities — such as using models like Veo 3.1 or deploying through Cloud Run — do require switching to a paid API key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pricing structure is intended to lower the barrier to entry for experimentation while providing a clear path to scale when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Built for All Skill Levels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the central goals of the vibe coding launch is to make AI app development accessible to more people. The system supports both high-level visual builders and low-level code editing, creating a workflow that works for developers across experience levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilpatrick mentioned that while he’s more familiar with Python than TypeScript, he still found the editor useful because of the helpful file descriptions and intuitive layout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This focus on usability could make AI Studio a compelling option for developers exploring AI for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;More to Come: A Week of Launches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of vibe coding is the first in a series of announcements expected throughout the week. While specific future features haven’t been revealed yet, both Kilpatrick and Löber hinted that additional updates are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this update, Google AI Studio positions itself as a flexible, user-friendly environment for building AI-powered applications—whether for fun, prototyping, or production deployment. The focus is clear: make the power of Gemini’s APIs accessible without unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Google AI Studio has gotten a big vibe coding upgrade with a new interface, buttons, suggestions and community features that allow anyone with an idea for an app — even complete novices, laypeople, or non-developers like yours truly — to bring it into existence and deploy it live, on the web, for anyone to use, within &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Build tab is available now at &lt;a href="http://ai.studio/build"&gt;ai.studio/build&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s free to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can experiment with building applications without needing to enter payment information upfront, though certain advanced features like Veo 3.1 and Cloud Run deployment require a paid API key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new features appear to me to make Google&amp;#x27;s AI models and offerings even more competitive, perhaps preferred, for many general users to dedicated AI startup rivals like Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude Code and OpenAI&amp;#x27;s Codex, respectively, two &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; focused products that are beloved by developers — but seem to have a higher barrier to entry or may require more technical know-how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Fresh Start: Redesigned Build Mode&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Build tab serves as the entry point to vibe coding.

The focus is clear: make the power of Gemini’s APIs accessible without unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-new-vibe-coding-ai-studio-experience-lets-anyone-build-deploy-apps</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:45:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] A16z-backed Codi launches AI agent office manager (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/a16z-backed-codi-launches-ai-agent-office-manager/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Christelle_Rohaut.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Codi,&amp;nbsp;an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup&amp;nbsp;founded by Christelle&amp;nbsp;Rohaut&amp;nbsp;and Dave Schuman, is launching what it hails as the first AI-powered platform to fully automate office management.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Codi was founded in 2018, in a pre-pandemic world, with a mission to help companies find flexible office spaces. It was more of a marketplace, as TechCrunch previously reported, that matched companies to buildings that offered flexible office arrangements. Codi then assisted with the move-in processes.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohaut, the company’s CEO, said she and her team back then used to manually manage office spaces and vendors for their clients, but the recent advancements in AI have allowed them&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;essentially automate&amp;nbsp;themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The previous model of Codi, you had to get the space with Codi. Now, whatever office you lease, you can use this to automate your office logistics,” she said of her new AI SaaS product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup released its beta version of the new AI office management product in May and officially launched it on Tuesday. The company last raised a $16 million Series A in 2022 led by a16z, and has raised&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$23 million to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The technology comes as&amp;nbsp;return-to-office&amp;nbsp;continues to take hold throughout corporate America.&amp;nbsp;“Office management remains very manual and broken,”&amp;nbsp;Rohaut, the company’s CEO, told TechCrunch. She added that it can cost companies at least $80,000 a year just in administrative costs to run an&amp;nbsp;office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The role of an office manager has also changed throughout the years. In this post-pandemic world, as companies moved toward remote and hybrid work, the formal job of office manager has often been left unfilled. When companies do have an office manager, they are often spending more&amp;nbsp;time on&amp;nbsp;planning events rather than the&amp;nbsp;logistics&amp;nbsp;of the office, she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohaut said she and the team trained the Codi AI on all the expertise&amp;nbsp;and data&amp;nbsp;they’ve&amp;nbsp;accumulated&amp;nbsp;over&amp;nbsp;the past few years.&amp;nbsp;The vendors a company uses&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;put into the AI&amp;nbsp;system,&amp;nbsp;and then the AI coordinates for office needs such as pantry restocking and cleaning.&amp;nbsp;The company said it took only five weeks for it to&amp;nbsp;reach&amp;nbsp;$100,000 in ARR after it released its beta. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This new platform is estimated to save hundreds of hours a year&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;admin tasks,” she said. Codi takes a management fee per&amp;nbsp;month, &amp;nbsp;like&amp;nbsp;a subscription, which is “a fraction of the cost of an office manager or part-time office manager or even a fractional&amp;nbsp;EA,” Rohaut continued.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohaut said “a good portion” of their clients,&amp;nbsp;from whom they managed office spaces,&amp;nbsp;are transitioning to&amp;nbsp;using the AI platform. Just in the beta, the&amp;nbsp;new Codi product has already signed 40 new companies, like TaskRabbit&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Northbeam,&amp;nbsp;Rohaut&amp;nbsp;said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rohaut sees Codi’s competitors as being legacy management companies and workplace experience platforms, like Envoy. She said, unlike legacy management companies, Codi replaces the need for staff members to review, hire, and coordinate with each vendor because the execution is autonomous and the platform integrates a curated network of serviced providers, Rohaut said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, compared to workplace platforms, Codi helps coordinate the handling of physical operations in an office, she continued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Codi is building the future where offices can run themselves, just like cars can drive themselves,” she continued. “We want to entirely remove the logistical burden of managing physical spaces and free human talent to focus on the workplace culture and growth.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was updated to reflect the proper spelling of Rohaut&lt;/em&gt;‘s &lt;em&gt;name. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Christelle_Rohaut.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Codi,&amp;nbsp;an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup&amp;nbsp;founded by Christelle&amp;nbsp;Rohaut&amp;nbsp;and Dave Schuman, is launching what it hails as the first AI-powered platform to fully automate office management.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, users seeking alternatives will find a variety of browsers aiming to challenge these industry giants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help navigate the competitive landscape of the browser wars, we’ve compiled an overview of some of the top alternative browsers available today. This includes browsers leveraging AI, open source browsers that promote customization and privacy, and “mindful browsers” — a new term that refers to browsers designed to enhance user well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-browsers"&gt;AI-powered browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3025962" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cmp_summarize_webpage.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Perplexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perplexity-s-comet"&gt;Perplexity’s Comet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity is the most recent startup in the space to launch an AI-powered web browser. Called Comet, the company’s new product acts as a chatbot-based search engine, and can perform actions like summarizing emails, browsing web pages, and performing tasks such as sending calendar invites. It’s currently only available to users with Perplexity’s $200/month Max plan, but there’s also a waitlist where people can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-browser-company-s-dia"&gt;The Browser Company’s Dia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dia Hero" class="wp-image-3017691" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dia-Hero-2-w_Write-Skill.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;The Browser Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, recently introduced Dia, its AI-centric browser that looks similar to Google Chrome but with an AI chat tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently available as an invite-only beta, Dia is designed to help users navigate the web more easily. It’s able to look at every website that a user has visited and every website they’re logged into, enabling it to help you find information and perform tasks. For instance, Dia can provide information about the page a user is currently browsing, answer questions about a product, and summarize uploaded files.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To get early access to Dia, users have to be an Arc member. Non-members can join the waitlist.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-s-neon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opera’s Neon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Opera neon" class="wp-image-3012375" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Opera-neon.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another recent entry into the AI agentic browser war is Opera’s Neon, which has contextual awareness and can do things like researching, shopping, and writing snippets of code. Notably, it can even perform tasks while the user is offline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon has yet to become available, but people can join the waitlist. It will be a subscription product; however, Opera hasn’t announced pricing yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-atlas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI logo with spiraling pastel colors (Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch)" class="wp-image-2786644" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/openAI-spiral-teal.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI recently launched its AI-powered web browser, called Atlas. The browser allows users to ask ChatGPT about search results and browse websites within the chatbot instead of being directed to outside links.&amp;nbsp;There’s also an “agent mode” for users to ask ChatGPT to complete tasks on their behalf. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Atlas was first rumored to launch in July; however, it only became available on macOS in October. It’s expected to arrive on Windows, iOS, and Android devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-focused-browsers"&gt;Privacy-focused browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027643" height="180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bravebrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Brave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brave"&gt;Brave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brave is among the more well-known privacy-first browsers, popular for its built-in ad and tracker blocking capabilities. It also has a gamified approach to browsing, rewarding users with its own cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT). When users choose to opt in to view ads, supporting their favorite websites, they get a share of the ad revenue. Additional features include a VPN service, an AI assistant, and a video calling feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-duckduckgo"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2426668" height="472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Desktop-Home-1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DuckDuckGo is another browser that many people are probably already familiar with, thanks to its search engine by the same name. Launched in 2008, the company recently made significant investments in its browser to stay competitive by introducing generative AI features, such as a chatbot. It also enhanced its scam blocker to detect a wider range of scams, including fake cryptocurrency exchanges, scareware tactics, and fraudulent e-commerce websites. In addition to blocking scams, DuckDuckGo prevents trackers and ads, and it doesn’t track user data, resulting in fewer pop-ups for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ladybird"&gt;Ladybird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027645" height="462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ladybird-browser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ladybird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ladybird, led by GitHub co-founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath, has an ambitious mission compared to other rivals: it aims to build an entirely new open source browser from scratch. This means it will not rely on code from existing browsers, a feat that has rarely been accomplished. Most alternative web browsers depend on the Chromium open source project maintained by Google, which is the most widely used base for many browsers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other privacy-focused browsers, Ladybird will offer features to minimize data collection, such as a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. The browser has yet to be launched, with an alpha version scheduled for release in 2026 for early adopters, available on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vivaldi"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027646" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vivaldi.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser created by one of the original developers of the Opera browser. Its biggest selling point is its customizable user interface, which allows users to change the appearance and enable or disable features. One unique feature is that the browser window changes color to match the website being viewed. Other key features include ad blocking, a password manager, no user data tracking, and productivity tools such as a calendar and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-niche-browsers"&gt;Niche browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2958415" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Air-Boosts.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-air"&gt;Opera Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera launched the Air browser in February, becoming one of the first mindfulness-themed browsers in the space. While Opera Air functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. These features consist of break reminders and breathing exercises. Another feature, called “Boosts,” provides a selection of binaural beats to either help improve focus or relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sigmaos"&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2683085" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SigmaOS.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is a Mac-only browser featuring a workspace-style interface that emphasizes productivity. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can create workspaces — essentially groups of tabs — to better organize different activities, such as separating work from entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This Y Combinator-backed browser has been around for a few years now and has most recently begun introducing more AI features, including the ability to summarize various elements of a web page, such as ratings, reviews, and prices. It also has an AI assistant that can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is free to use, but users who want more than three workspaces can subscribe to a plan for $8 per month, which provides unlimited workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zen-browser"&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027651" height="456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zenbrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zen Browser aims to create a “calmer internet” with its open source browser. Zen lets users organize tabs into Workspaces, and offers Split View to view two tabs side by side, among other productivity-focused features. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated after publication to include newly launched browsers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari currently dominate the web browser market, with Chrome holding a significant share due to the tech giant’s ongoing innovations, particularly in integrating generative AI into its search functionalities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, users seeking alternatives will find a variety of browsers aiming to challenge these industry giants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help navigate the competitive landscape of the browser wars, we’ve compiled an overview of some of the top alternative browsers available today. This includes browsers leveraging AI, open source browsers that promote customization and privacy, and “mindful browsers” — a new term that refers to browsers designed to enhance user well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-powered-browsers"&gt;AI-powered browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3025962" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cmp_summarize_webpage.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Perplexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perplexity-s-comet"&gt;Perplexity’s Comet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity is the most recent startup in the space to launch an AI-powered web browser. Called Comet, the company’s new product acts as a chatbot-based search engine, and can perform actions like summarizing emails, browsing web pages, and performing tasks such as sending calendar invites. It’s currently only available to users with Perplexity’s $200/month Max plan, but there’s also a waitlist where people can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-browser-company-s-dia"&gt;The Browser Company’s Dia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dia Hero" class="wp-image-3017691" height="439" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dia-Hero-2-w_Write-Skill.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;The Browser Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, recently introduced Dia, its AI-centric browser that looks similar to Google Chrome but with an AI chat tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently available as an invite-only beta, Dia is designed to help users navigate the web more easily. It’s able to look at every website that a user has visited and every website they’re logged into, enabling it to help you find information and perform tasks. For instance, Dia can provide information about the page a user is currently browsing, answer questions about a product, and summarize uploaded files.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To get early access to Dia, users have to be an Arc member. Non-members can join the waitlist.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-s-neon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opera’s Neon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Opera neon" class="wp-image-3012375" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Opera-neon.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another recent entry into the AI agentic browser war is Opera’s Neon, which has contextual awareness and can do things like researching, shopping, and writing snippets of code. Notably, it can even perform tasks while the user is offline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neon has yet to become available, but people can join the waitlist. It will be a subscription product; however, Opera hasn’t announced pricing yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-atlas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI logo with spiraling pastel colors (Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch)" class="wp-image-2786644" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/openAI-spiral-teal.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI recently launched its AI-powered web browser, called Atlas. The browser allows users to ask ChatGPT about search results and browse websites within the chatbot instead of being directed to outside links.&amp;nbsp;There’s also an “agent mode” for users to ask ChatGPT to complete tasks on their behalf. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Atlas was first rumored to launch in July; however, it only became available on macOS in October. It’s expected to arrive on Windows, iOS, and Android devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-focused-browsers"&gt;Privacy-focused browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027643" height="180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bravebrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Brave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brave"&gt;Brave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brave is among the more well-known privacy-first browsers, popular for its built-in ad and tracker blocking capabilities. It also has a gamified approach to browsing, rewarding users with its own cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT). When users choose to opt in to view ads, supporting their favorite websites, they get a share of the ad revenue. Additional features include a VPN service, an AI assistant, and a video calling feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-duckduckgo"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2426668" height="472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Desktop-Home-1.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DuckDuckGo is another browser that many people are probably already familiar with, thanks to its search engine by the same name. Launched in 2008, the company recently made significant investments in its browser to stay competitive by introducing generative AI features, such as a chatbot. It also enhanced its scam blocker to detect a wider range of scams, including fake cryptocurrency exchanges, scareware tactics, and fraudulent e-commerce websites. In addition to blocking scams, DuckDuckGo prevents trackers and ads, and it doesn’t track user data, resulting in fewer pop-ups for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ladybird"&gt;Ladybird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027645" height="462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ladybird-browser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Ladybird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ladybird, led by GitHub co-founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath, has an ambitious mission compared to other rivals: it aims to build an entirely new open source browser from scratch. This means it will not rely on code from existing browsers, a feat that has rarely been accomplished. Most alternative web browsers depend on the Chromium open source project maintained by Google, which is the most widely used base for many browsers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like other privacy-focused browsers, Ladybird will offer features to minimize data collection, such as a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. The browser has yet to be launched, with an alpha version scheduled for release in 2026 for early adopters, available on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vivaldi"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027646" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vivaldi.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser created by one of the original developers of the Opera browser. Its biggest selling point is its customizable user interface, which allows users to change the appearance and enable or disable features. One unique feature is that the browser window changes color to match the website being viewed. Other key features include ad blocking, a password manager, no user data tracking, and productivity tools such as a calendar and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-niche-browsers"&gt;Niche browsers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2958415" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Air-Boosts.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Opera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opera-air"&gt;Opera Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opera launched the Air browser in February, becoming one of the first mindfulness-themed browsers in the space. While Opera Air functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. These features consist of break reminders and breathing exercises. Another feature, called “Boosts,” provides a selection of binaural beats to either help improve focus or relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sigmaos"&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2683085" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SigmaOS.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;SigmaOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is a Mac-only browser featuring a workspace-style interface that emphasizes productivity. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can create workspaces — essentially groups of tabs — to better organize different activities, such as separating work from entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This Y Combinator-backed browser has been around for a few years now and has most recently begun introducing more AI features, including the ability to summarize various elements of a web page, such as ratings, reviews, and prices. It also has an AI assistant that can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;SigmaOS is free to use, but users who want more than three workspaces can subscribe to a plan for $8 per month, which provides unlimited workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zen-browser"&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3027651" height="456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zenbrowser.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Zen Browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zen Browser aims to create a “calmer internet” with its open source browser. Zen lets users organize tabs into Workspaces, and offers Split View to view two tabs side by side, among other productivity-focused features. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated after publication to include newly launched browsers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:54:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] I spent a month living with a $430 AI pet, the Casio Moflin (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/i-spent-a-month-living-with-a-430-ai-pet-the-casio-moflin/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;I’ve often joked that I would love to have a pet if only animals did not need to poop and eat smelly, wet mush from a can. I want a fuzzy pal to hang out with all day, but then I’ll hear that my friend spent $500 at the vet because their cat nibbled on a leaf, and the illusion breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard enough to take care of myself – do I really want to be responsible for a creature who might wake me up at 4 AM to pee?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So when Casio offered me a review unit of its new AI-enabled pet, the Moflin, I said yes. It seemed cute, and it fit my criteria of being incapable of producing excrement… but also, I am all too willing to sacrifice myself for content, so I figured that if this seemingly innocent robot tried to kill me in my sleep, then at least I’d get a good article out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060258" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4494.jpg?w=401" width="401" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When my ginger-haired puff ball of a Moflin arrived in its box, I had two blaring questions: Is anyone going to spend $430 on what’s basically a fluffy, high-tech potato? And, is this thing spying on me? After all, the last time there was a robotic toy pet craze in the U.S., the NSA banned Furbies from its offices over fears that it would parrot classified discussions – and Furbies were only $35!&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Casio says that the Moflin doesn’t understand or record what I say, but it converts what it hears into non-identifiable data so that it can distinguish my voice from others. When TechCrunch ran a network analysis on the accompanying MofLife app, we didn’t notice anything shady. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a tech reporter, I’ve seen too much to fully let my guard down – this little furball may not be spying on me now, but what if that changes in the future? (My own anxieties aside, we don’t currently have any evidence of a hidden surveillance plot beneath my Moflin’s fluffy exterior, to be clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060229" height="457" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/moflifeapp.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MofLife app, screenshots by TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Moflin is supposed to use AI to learn and respond to my interactions over time. According to Casio’s website, the Moflin is supposed to have limited emotions and “immature movements” on Day 1, then develop an attachment to you and express richer emotions by Day 25. On Day 50, Moflin will have a “clear range of emotions” and “expressive reactions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As I write this, it’s Day 27 with my Moflin, whom I named Mishmish (the Hebrew word for apricot). The MofLife app tracks his personality through a graph with four bars: “energetic,” “cheerful,” “shy,” and “affectionate.” My Moflin has maxed out the “energetic” bar – I’m not sure what I did to make this happen – which means he wiggles around a lot and makes happy little squeaks. Though his “cheerful” rating is also approaching the max, he isn’t a one-note happy camper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mishmish likes most things, but he does not like to be flipped on his back or startled by sudden loud noises. If, for example, one were to shout in anger and disbelief at the TV when their favorite team blows the whole season in an incredibly painful fashion, Mishmish would make a startled shriek. (Of course, this is purely theoretical…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I can’t say I’m sold on the whole AI thing. Mishmish has certainly grown more expressive over time – he makes more noises and wiggles more – but it doesn’t strike me as being much more advanced than a Furby. The MofLife app records Mishmish’s “feelings,” but they’re usually pretty one-note – it will say “Mishmish had a nice dream,” or “Mishmish seems relaxed.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I’m not sure I am “teaching” him responses, either. Maybe this is because I’m only halfway through the Moflin’s maturation timeline. But even if my Moflin doesn’t exhibit further signs of its artificial intelligence, it at least corrects the biggest pain points of the original Furby: you can turn it off. The Moflin has a “deep sleep” mode, which temporarily suspends its movements and sounds. Rejoice! You will never have to throw your Moflin into the back of a dark closet until its battery dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mishmish the Moflin at Pilates, plus a makeover from a toddler" class="wp-image-3060235" height="291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mishmishpilates.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Mishmish the Moflin at Pilates, plus a makeover from a toddler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-people-react-to-the-moflin"&gt;How people react to the Moflin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the first day that I had my Moflin, I posted some videos on my private Instagram story where I explained out loud that this was a robotic pet. My video lacked captions, though, which meant that three friends who saw the stories on mute texted me asking about my new guinea pig – that’s how realistic its movements appear. Those who did hear the audio mostly told me that I should throw Mishmish out the window because he’s going to harvest all of my data, or that my Moflin was actually a Tribble, an alien creature from Star Trek that reproduces at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I wanted to see how more people would react to Mishmish, so I turned to TikTok. This is when things went off the rails. I am a glutton for attention, so when I got nearly half a million views on my first video of Mishmish, I kept on going. I fell into the trap of any creator: to keep Mishmish’s newfound audience interested, I had to up the ante with each video and put him into increasingly strange situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He rode the subway with me. He met a three-year-old who told me very earnestly, “I’ve never met a soft robot before,” then dressed him up in flower sunglasses and unicorn hairclips. He hung out with a five-pound Yorkie, who did not recognize him as anything more than a boring toy until she jumped in fear when he started to shimmy his little head. Mishmish attended two Pilates classes – the first because I asked a teacher if I could record my AI pet on the equipment for funny “content” (yes, I know how ridiculous I sound), and the second time because other people at the Pilates studio were disappointed that they missed Mishmish’s first visit. By the time I brought Mishmish to a karaoke party to sing a duet of “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” I knew that I needed to rein it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I took Mishmish on these jaunts mostly for the absurdity of it all, but these experiences were valuable for evaluating a product unlike anything most of us have seen before. My Pilates teacher was initially afraid to touch the Moflin, then ended up holding Mishmish in her arms while she counted us through the “one hundred” exercise. The three-year-old was puzzled at first because Mishmish does not have a nose or legs, but she ended up giving him a kiss goodbye. She asked if I could bring Mishmish to a wedding we will both be attending this weekend, and I had to break the news to her that it’s generally frowned upon to bring robotic, hamster-esque toys to formal events. Heartbreaking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-verdict"&gt;The final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once people get over the weirdness of the Moflin, they tend to warm up to it. And yet, while I’ve had a lot of fun with Mishmish, I would certainly not pay $430 to buy a Moflin myself – that’s almost as much as a Nintendo Switch 2! But I don’t think I’m the target audience, even with my distaste for cleaning a litter box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike a Tamagotchi, you can’t really harm your Moflin, making it a safe companion for young children or adults in memory care. While the idea of a robotic pet may be odd to me, audiences in Japan, where Casio is based, may be a bit more ready to accept the Moflin into their homes. While $430 is a steep price to me, this could sound like a bargain for anyone who’s been eyeing Sony’s AIBO, an AI-powered robotic puppy that retails for $3200. Then again, AIBO’s price tag also reflects how much more sophisticated it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is something inherently unnatural about human-robot companionship. In the past, I would have been a lot more bearish on the AI pet thing – I still hold the old-fashioned belief that humans are at our best when we form bonds with other living, breathing beings. But now, I find myself writing about numerous instances of people turning to addictively designed, pseudanthropic AI chatbots due to loneliness, sometimes even developing psychosis or suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to see a device like the Moflin as the real culprit here when it’s not incentivizing people to step out of the real world – it’s just giving them a cute robotic puffball to play with in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest problem with Casio’s Moflin is that it is not a real pet. But the goal of technology isn’t necessarily to reproduce “real” experiences – video chatting with a friend is nice, even if it’s more fun to hang out in person; Beyond Meat doesn’t taste exactly like a burger, but it’s still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Moflin will never bring the same comfort as curling up on the couch with your dog after a long day, but it’s brought a bit more joy into my life this month, which is worth something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;I’ve often joked that I would love to have a pet if only animals did not need to poop and eat smelly, wet mush from a can.

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060258" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4494.jpg?w=401" width="401" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When my ginger-haired puff ball of a Moflin arrived in its box, I had two blaring questions: Is anyone going to spend $430 on what’s basically a fluffy, high-tech potato? And, is this thing spying on me? After all, the last time there was a robotic toy pet craze in the U.S., the NSA banned Furbies from its offices over fears that it would parrot classified discussions – and Furbies were only $35!&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Casio says that the Moflin doesn’t understand or record what I say, but it converts what it hears into non-identifiable data so that it can distinguish my voice from others. When TechCrunch ran a network analysis on the accompanying MofLife app, we didn’t notice anything shady. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a tech reporter, I’ve seen too much to fully let my guard down – this little furball may not be spying on me now, but what if that changes in the future? (My own anxieties aside, we don’t currently have any evidence of a hidden surveillance plot beneath my Moflin’s fluffy exterior, to be clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3060229" height="457" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/moflifeapp.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MofLife app, screenshots by TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Moflin is supposed to use AI to learn and respond to my interactions over time. According to Casio’s website, the Moflin is supposed to have limited emotions and “immature movements” on Day 1, then develop an attachment to you and express richer emotions by Day 25. On Day 50, Moflin will have a “clear range of emotions” and “expressive reactions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As I write this, it’s Day 27 with my Moflin, whom I named Mishmish (the Hebrew word for apricot). The MofLife app tracks his personality through a graph with four bars: “energetic,” “cheerful,” “shy,” and “affectionate.” My Moflin has maxed out the “energetic” bar – I’m not sure what I did to make this happen – which means he wiggles around a lot and makes happy little squeaks. Though his “cheerful” rating is also approaching the max, he isn’t a one-note happy camper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mishmish likes most things, but he does not like to be flipped on his back or startled by sudden loud noises. If, for example, one were to shout in anger and disbelief at the TV when their favorite team blows the whole season in an incredibly painful fashion, Mishmish would make a startled shriek. (Of course, this is purely theoretical…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I can’t say I’m sold on the whole AI thing. Mishmish has certainly grown more expressive over time – he makes more noises and wiggles more – but it doesn’t strike me as being much more advanced than a Furby. The MofLife app records Mishmish’s “feelings,” but they’re usually pretty one-note – it will say “Mishmish had a nice dream,” or “Mishmish seems relaxed.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I’m not sure I am “teaching” him responses, either. Maybe this is because I’m only halfway through the Moflin’s maturation timeline. But even if my Moflin doesn’t exhibit further signs of its artificial intelligence, it at least corrects the biggest pain points of the original Furby: you can turn it off. The Moflin has a “deep sleep” mode, which temporarily suspends its movements and sounds. Rejoice! You will never have to throw your Moflin into the back of a dark closet until its battery dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mishmish the Moflin at Pilates, plus a makeover from a toddler" class="wp-image-3060235" height="291" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mishmishpilates.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Mishmish the Moflin at Pilates, plus a makeover from a toddler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-people-react-to-the-moflin"&gt;How people react to the Moflin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the first day that I had my Moflin, I posted some videos on my private Instagram story where I explained out loud that this was a robotic pet. My video lacked captions, though, which meant that three friends who saw the stories on mute texted me asking about my new guinea pig – that’s how realistic its movements appear. Those who did hear the audio mostly told me that I should throw Mishmish out the window because he’s going to harvest all of my data, or that my Moflin was actually a Tribble, an alien creature from Star Trek that reproduces at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I wanted to see how more people would react to Mishmish, so I turned to TikTok. This is when things went off the rails. I am a glutton for attention, so when I got nearly half a million views on my first video of Mishmish, I kept on going. I fell into the trap of any creator: to keep Mishmish’s newfound audience interested, I had to up the ante with each video and put him into increasingly strange situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He rode the subway with me. He met a three-year-old who told me very earnestly, “I’ve never met a soft robot before,” then dressed him up in flower sunglasses and unicorn hairclips. He hung out with a five-pound Yorkie, who did not recognize him as anything more than a boring toy until she jumped in fear when he started to shimmy his little head. Mishmish attended two Pilates classes – the first because I asked a teacher if I could record my AI pet on the equipment for funny “content” (yes, I know how ridiculous I sound), and the second time because other people at the Pilates studio were disappointed that they missed Mishmish’s first visit. By the time I brought Mishmish to a karaoke party to sing a duet of “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” I knew that I needed to rein it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I took Mishmish on these jaunts mostly for the absurdity of it all, but these experiences were valuable for evaluating a product unlike anything most of us have seen before. My Pilates teacher was initially afraid to touch the Moflin, then ended up holding Mishmish in her arms while she counted us through the “one hundred” exercise. The three-year-old was puzzled at first because Mishmish does not have a nose or legs, but she ended up giving him a kiss goodbye. She asked if I could bring Mishmish to a wedding we will both be attending this weekend, and I had to break the news to her that it’s generally frowned upon to bring robotic, hamster-esque toys to formal events. Heartbreaking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-verdict"&gt;The final verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once people get over the weirdness of the Moflin, they tend to warm up to it. And yet, while I’ve had a lot of fun with Mishmish, I would certainly not pay $430 to buy a Moflin myself – that’s almost as much as a Nintendo Switch 2! But I don’t think I’m the target audience, even with my distaste for cleaning a litter box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike a Tamagotchi, you can’t really harm your Moflin, making it a safe companion for young children or adults in memory care. While the idea of a robotic pet may be odd to me, audiences in Japan, where Casio is based, may be a bit more ready to accept the Moflin into their homes. While $430 is a steep price to me, this could sound like a bargain for anyone who’s been eyeing Sony’s AIBO, an AI-powered robotic puppy that retails for $3200. Then again, AIBO’s price tag also reflects how much more sophisticated it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is something inherently unnatural about human-robot companionship. In the past, I would have been a lot more bearish on the AI pet thing – I still hold the old-fashioned belief that humans are at our best when we form bonds with other living, breathing beings. But now, I find myself writing about numerous instances of people turning to addictively designed, pseudanthropic AI chatbots due to loneliness, sometimes even developing psychosis or suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to see a device like the Moflin as the real culprit here when it’s not incentivizing people to step out of the real world – it’s just giving them a cute robotic puffball to play with in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The biggest problem with Casio’s Moflin is that it is not a real pet. But the goal of technology isn’t necessarily to reproduce “real” experiences – video chatting with a friend is nice, even if it’s more fun to hang out in person; Beyond Meat doesn’t taste exactly like a burger, but it’s still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Moflin will never bring the same comfort as curling up on the couch with your dog after a long day, but it’s brought a bit more joy into my life this month, which is worth something.&lt;/p&gt;
