            &lt;p&gt;How can you use science to build a better gingerbread house?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was something Miranda Schwacke spent a lot of time thinking about. The MIT graduate student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) is part of&amp;nbsp;Kitchen Matters, a group of grad students who use food and kitchen tools to explain scientific concepts&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;short videos and outreach events. Past topics included why chocolate “seizes,” or becomes difficult to work with when melting (spoiler: water gets in), and how to make isomalt, the sugar glass that stunt performers jump through in action movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when the group was making a video on&amp;nbsp;how to build a structurally sound gingerbread house, Schwacke scoured cookbooks for a variable that would produce the most dramatic difference in the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was reading about what determines the texture of cookies, and then tried several recipes in my kitchen until I got two gingerbread recipes that I was happy with,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focused on&amp;nbsp;butter, which contains water that turns to steam at high baking temperatures, creating air pockets in cookies. Schwacke predicted that decreasing the amount of butter would yield denser gingerbread, strong enough to hold together as a house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis is an example of how changing the structure can influence the properties and performance of material,” Schwacke said in the eight-minute video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same curiosity about materials properties and performance drives her research on the high energy cost of computing, especially for artificial intelligence. Schwacke develops new materials and devices for neuromorphic computing, which mimics the brain by processing and storing information in the same place. She studies electrochemical ionic synapses — tiny devices that can be “tuned” to adjust conductivity, much like neurons strengthening or weakening connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at AI in particular — to&amp;nbsp;train these really large models — that consumes a lot of energy. And if you compare that to the amount of energy that we consume as humans when we’re learning things, the brain consumes a lot less energy,” Schwacke says. “That’s what led to this idea to find more brain-inspired, energy-efficient ways of doing AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advisor, Bilge Yildiz, underscores the point: One reason the brain is so efficient is that data doesn’t need to be moved back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, the connections between our neurons, called synapses, are where we process information. Signal transmission is there. It is processed, programmed, and also stored in the same place,” says Yildiz, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and DMSE. Schwacke’s devices aim to replicate that efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a marine biologist mom and an electrical engineer dad, Schwacke was immersed in science from a young age. Science was “always a part of how I understood the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was obsessed with dinosaurs. I wanted to be a paleontologist when I grew up,” she says. But her interests broadened. At her middle school in Charleston, South Carolina, she joined a FIRST Lego League robotics competition, building robots to complete tasks like pushing or pulling objects. “My parents, my dad especially, got very involved in the school team and helping us design and build our little robot for the competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother, meanwhile, studied how dolphin populations are affected by pollution for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That had a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was an example of how science can be used to understand the world, and also to figure out how we can improve the world,” Schwacke says. “And that’s what I’ve always wanted to do with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her interest in materials science came later, in&amp;nbsp;her&amp;nbsp;high school&amp;nbsp;magnet program. There, she was introduced to the interdisciplinary subject, a blend of physics, chemistry, and engineering that studies the structure and properties of materials and uses that knowledge to design new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always liked that it goes from this very basic science, where we’re studying how atoms are ordering, all the way up to these solid materials that we interact with in our everyday lives — and how that gives them their properties that we can see and play with,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior, she participated in a research program with a thesis project on dye-sensitized solar cells, a low-cost, lightweight solar technology that uses dye molecules to absorb light and generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What drove me was really understanding, this is how we go from light to energy that we can use — and also seeing how this could help us with having more renewable energy sources,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After high school, she headed across the country to Caltech. “I wanted to try a totally new place,” she says, where she studied materials science, including nanostructured materials thousands of times thinner than a human hair. She focused on materials properties and microstructure — the tiny internal structure that governs how materials behave — which led her to electrochemical systems like batteries and fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI energy challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, she continued exploring energy technologies. She met Yildiz during a Zoom meeting in her first year of graduate school, in fall 2020, when the campus was still operating under strict Covid-19 protocols.&amp;nbsp;Yildiz’s lab studies how charged atoms, or ions, move through materials in technologies like fuel cells, batteries, and electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab’s research into brain-inspired computing fired Schwacke’s imagination, but she was equally drawn to Yildiz’s way of talking about science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t based on jargon and emphasized a very basic understanding of what was going on — that ions are going here, and electrons are going here — to understand fundamentally what’s happening in the system,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mindset shaped her approach to research. Her early projects focused on the properties these devices need to work well — fast operation, low energy use, and compatibility with semiconductor technology — and on using magnesium ions instead of hydrogen, which can escape into the environment and make devices unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her current project, the focus of her PhD thesis, centers on understanding how the insertion of magnesium ions into tungsten oxide, a metal oxide whose electrical properties can be precisely tuned, changes its electrical resistance. In these devices, tungsten oxide serves as a channel layer, where resistance controls signal strength, much like synapses regulate signals in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am trying to understand exactly how these devices change the channel conductance,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke’s research was recognized with a MathWorks Fellowship from the School of Engineering in 2023 and 2024. The fellowship supports graduate students who leverage tools like MATLAB or Simulink in their work; Schwacke applied MATLAB for critical data analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yildiz describes Schwacke’s research as a novel step toward solving one of AI’s biggest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is electrochemistry for brain-inspired computing,” Yildiz says. “It’s a new context for electrochemistry, but also with an energy implication, because the energy consumption of computing is unsustainably increasing. We have to find new ways of doing computing with much lower energy, and this is one way that can help us move in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any pioneering work, it comes with challenges, especially in bridging the concepts between electrochemistry and semiconductor physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our group comes from a solid-state chemistry background, and when we started this work looking into magnesium, no one had used magnesium in these kinds of devices before,” Schwacke says. “So we were looking at the magnesium battery literature for inspiration and different materials and strategies we could use. When I started this, I wasn’t just learning the language and norms for one field — I was trying to learn it for two fields, and also translate between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also grapples with a challenge familiar to all scientists: how to make sense of messy data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main challenge is being able to take my data and know that I’m interpreting it in a way that’s correct, and that I understand what it actually means,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She overcomes hurdles by collaborating closely with colleagues across fields, including neuroscience and electrical engineering, and sometimes by just making small changes to her experiments and watching what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke is not just active in the lab. In Kitchen Matters, she and her fellow DMSE grad students set up booths at local events like the Cambridge Science Fair and Steam It Up, an after-school program with hands-on activities for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did ‘pHun with Food’ with ‘fun’ spelled with a pH, so we had cabbage juice as a pH indicator,” Schwacke says. “We let the kids test the pH of lemon juice and vinegar and dish soap, and they had a lot of fun mixing the different liquids and seeing all the different colors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also served as the social chair and treasurer for DMSE’s graduate student group, the Graduate Materials Council. As an undergraduate at Caltech, she led workshops in science and technology for Robogals, a student-run group that encourages young women to pursue careers in science, and assisted students in applying for the school’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Schwacke, these experiences sharpened her ability to explain science to different audiences, a skill she sees as vital whether she’s presenting at a kids’ fair or at a research conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always think, where is my audience starting from, and what do I need to explain before I can get into what I’m doing so that it’ll all make sense to them?” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke sees the ability to communicate as central to building community, which she considers an important part of doing research. “It helps with spreading ideas. It always helps to get a new perspective on what you’re working on,” she says. “I also think it keeps us sane during our PhD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yildiz sees Schwacke’s community involvement as an important part of her resume. “She’s doing all these activities to motivate the broader community to do research, to be interested in science, to pursue science and technology, but that ability will help her also progress in her own research and academic endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her PhD, Schwacke wants to take that ability to communicate with her to academia, where she’d like to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. Yildiz&amp;nbsp;has no doubt she’ll thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think she’s a perfect fit,” Yildiz says. “She’s brilliant, but brilliance by itself is not enough. She’s persistent, resilient. You really need those on top of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward that billion-ton benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, warns Robert Höglund, cofounder of CDR.fyi, a public-benefit corporation that provides data and analysis on the carbon removal industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re past the peak of expectations,” he says. “And with that, we could see a lot of companies go out of business, which is natural for any industry.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odd quirk of carbon removal is that it never made a lot of sense as a business proposition: It’s an atmospheric cleanup job, necessary for the collective societal good of curbing climate change. But it doesn’t produce a service or product that any individual or organization strictly needs—or is especially eager to pay for.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To date, a number of businesses have voluntarily agreed to buy tons of carbon dioxide that companies intend to eventually suck out of the air. But whether they’re motivated by sincere climate concerns or pressures from investors, employees, or customers, corporate do-goodism will only scale any industry so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most observers argue that whether carbon removal continues to bobble along or transforms into something big enough to make a dent in climate change will depend largely on whether governments around the world decide to pay for a whole, whole lot of it—or force polluters to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Private-sector purchases will never get us there,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “We need policy; it has to be policy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carbon removal sector began to scale up in the early part of this decade, as increasingly grave climate studies revealed the need to dramatically cut emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; suck down vast amounts of carbon dioxide to keep global warming in check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, nations may have to continually remove as much as 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by around midcentury to have a solid chance of keeping the planet from warming past 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a UN climate panel report in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A number of startups sprang up to begin developing the technology and building the infrastructure that would be needed, trying out a variety of approaches like sinking seaweed or building carbon-dioxide-sucking factories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they soon attracted customers. Companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Microsoft, and others began agreeing to pre-purchase tons of carbon removal, hoping to stand up the nascent industry and help offset their own climate emissions. Venture investments also flooded into the space, peaking in 2023 at nearly $1 billion, according to data provided by PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From early on, players in the emerging sector sought to draw a sharp distinction between conventional carbon offset projects, which studies have shown frequently exaggerate climate benefits, and “durable” carbon removal that could be relied upon to suck down and store away the greenhouse gas for decades to centuries. There’s certainly a big difference in the price: While buying carbon offsets through projects that promise to preserve forests or plant trees might cost a few dollars per ton, a ton of carbon removal can run hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;That high price, however, brings big challenges. Removing 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year at, say, $300 a ton adds up to a global price tag of $3 trillion—a year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the fundamental question: Who should or would foot the bill to develop and operate all the factories, pipelines, and wells needed to capture, move, and bury billions upon billions of tons of carbon dioxide?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The state of the market&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The market is still growing, as companies voluntarily purchase tons of carbon removal to make strides toward their climate goals. In fact, sales reached an all-time high in the second quarter of this year, mostly thanks to several massive purchases by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But industry sources fear that demand isn’t growing fast enough to support a significant share of the startups that have formed or even the projects being built, undermining the momentum required to scale the sector up to the size needed by midcentury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, all those hundreds of companies that have spun up in recent years have disclosed deals to sell some 38 million tons of carbon dioxide pulled from the air, according to CDR.fyi. That’s roughly the amount the US pumps out in energy-related emissions every three days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And they’ve only delivered around 940,000 tons of carbon removal. The US emits that much carbon dioxide in less than two hours. (Not every transaction is publicly announced or revealed to CDR.fyi, so the actual figures could run a bit higher.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another concern is that the same handful of big players continue to account for the vast majority of the overall purchases, leaving the health and direction of the market dependent on their whims and fortunes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most glaringly, Microsoft has agreed to buy 80% of all the carbon removal purchased to date, according to&amp;nbsp; CDR.fyi. The second-biggest buyer is Frontier, a coalition of companies that includes Google, Meta, Stripe, and Shopify, which has committed to spend $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you strip out those two buyers, the market shrinks from 16 million tons under contract during the first half of this year to just 1.2 million, according to data provided to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;by CDR.fyi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Signs of trouble&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the investor appetite for carbon removal is cooling. For the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2025, venture capital investments in the sector fell more than 13% from the same period last year, according to data provided by PitchBook. That tightening funding will make it harder and harder for companies that aren’t bringing in revenue to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Companies that have already shut down also include the carbon removal marketplace Noya and Alkali Earth, which was attempting to use industrial by-products to tie up carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still other businesses are struggling. Climeworks, one of the first companies to build direct-air-capture (DAC) factories, announced it was laying off 10% of its staff in May, as it grapples with challenges on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company’s plans to collaborate on the development of a major facility in the US have been at least delayed as the Trump administration has held back tens of millions of dollars in funding granted in 2023 under the Department of Energy’s Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. It now appears the government could terminate the funding altogether, along with perhaps tens of billions of dollars’ worth of additional grants previously awarded for a variety of other US carbon removal and climate tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Market rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,” Christoph Gebald, one of the company’s co-CEOs, said in a previous statement to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “The need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we’re working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But purchases from direct-air-capture projects fell nearly 16% last year and account for just 8% of all carbon removal transactions to date. Buyers are increasingly looking to categories that promise to deliver tons faster and for less money, notably including burying biochar or installing carbon capture equipment on bioenergy plants. (Read more in my recent story on that method of carbon removal, known as BECCS, here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CDR.fyi recently described the climate for direct air capture in grim terms: “The sector has grown rapidly, but the honeymoon is over: Investment and sales are falling, while deployments are delayed across almost every company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most DAC companies,” the organization added, “will fold or be acquired.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, most observers believe carbon removal isn’t really going to take off unless governments bring their resources and regulations to bear. That could mean making direct purchases, subsidizing these sectors, or getting polluters to pay the costs to do so—for instance, by folding carbon removal into market-based emissions reductions mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More government support does appear to be on the way. Notably, the European Commission recently proposed allowing “domestic carbon removal” within its EU Emissions Trading System after 2030, integrating the sector into one of the largest cap-and-trade programs. The system forces power plants and other polluters in member countries to increasingly cut their emissions or pay for them over time, as the cap on pollution tightens and the price on carbon rises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could create incentives for more European companies to pay direct-air-capture or bioenergy facilities to draw down carbon dioxide as a means of helping them meet their climate obligations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN organization that establishes standards for the aviation industry, is considering incorporating carbon removal into its market-based mechanism for reducing the sector’s emissions. That might take several forms, including allowing airlines to purchase carbon removal to offset their use of traditional jet fuel or requiring the use of carbon dioxide obtained through direct air capture in some share of sustainable aviation fuels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Canada has committed to spend $10 million on carbon removal and is developing a protocol to allow direct air capture in its national offsets program. And Japan will begin accepting several categories of carbon removal in its emissions trading system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back funding for the development of carbon-sucking projects, the US does continue to subsidize storage of carbon dioxide, whether it comes from power plants, ethanol refineries, direct-air-capture plants, or other facilities. The so-called 45Q tax credit, which is worth up to $180 a ton, was among the few forms of government support for climate-tech-related sectors that survived in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill. In fact, the subsidies for putting carbon dioxide to other uses increased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in the current US political climate, Burns is hopeful that local or federal legislators will continue to enact policies that support specific categories of carbon removal in the regions where they make the most sense, because the projects can provide economic growth and jobs as well as climate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think there are lots of models for what carbon removal policy can look like that aren’t just things like tax incentives,” she says. “And I think that this particular political moment gives us the opportunity in a unique way to start to look at what those regionally specific and pathway specific policies look like.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dangers ahead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if more nations do provide the money or enact the laws necessary to drive the business of durable carbon renewal forward, there are mounting concerns that a sector conceived as an alternative to dubious offset markets could increasingly come to replicate their problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Various incentives are pulling in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Financial pressures are building on suppliers to deliver tons of carbon removal. Corporate buyers are looking for the fastest and most affordable way of hitting their climate goals. And the organizations that set standards and accredit carbon removal projects often earn more money as the volume of purchases rises, creating clear conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the same carbon registries that have long signed off on carbon offset projects have begun creating standards or issuing credits for various forms of carbon removal, including Verra and Gold Standard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reliable assurance that a project’s declared ton of carbon savings equates to a real ton of emissions removed, reduced, or avoided is crucial,” Cynthia Giles, a senior EPA advisor under President Biden, and Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent editorial in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “Yet extensive research from many contexts shows that auditors selected and paid by audited organizations often produce results skewed toward those entities’ interests.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Noah McQueen, the director of science and innovation at Carbon180, has stressed that the industry must strive to counter the mounting credibility risks, noting in a recent LinkedIn post: “Growth matters, but growth without integrity isn’t growth at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an interview, McQueen said that heading off the problem will require developing and enforcing standards to truly ensure that carbon removal projects deliver the climate benefits promised. McQueen added that to gain trust, the industry needs to earn buy-in from the communities in which these projects are built and avoid the environmental and health impacts that power plants and heavy industry have historically inflicted on disadvantaged communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting it right will require governments to take a larger role in the sector than just subsidizing it, argues David Ho, a professor at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa who focuses&amp;nbsp; on ocean-based carbon removal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says there should be a massive, multinational research drive to determine the most effective ways of mopping up the atmosphere with minimal environmental or social harm, likening it to a Manhattan Project (minus the whole nuclear bomb bit).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we’re serious about doing this, then let’s make it a government effort,” he says, “so that you can try out all the things, determine what works and what doesn’t, and you don’t have to please your VCs or concentrate on developing [intellectual property] so you can sell yourself to a fossil-fuel company.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ho adds that there’s a moral imperative for the world’s historically biggest climate polluters to build and pay for the carbon-sucking and storage infrastructure required to draw down billions of tons of greenhouse gas. That’s because the world’s poorest, hottest nations, which have contributed the least to climate change, will nevertheless face the greatest dangers from intensifying heat waves, droughts, famines, and sea-level rise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It should be seen as waste management for the waste we’re going to dump on the Global South,” he says, “because they’re the people who will suffer the most from climate change.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2154475415.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward that billion-ton benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, warns Robert Höglund, cofounder of CDR.fyi, a public-benefit corporation that provides data and analysis on the carbon removal industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re past the peak of expectations,” he says. “And with that, we could see a lot of companies go out of business, which is natural for any industry.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The odd quirk of carbon removal is that it never made a lot of sense as a business proposition: It’s an atmospheric cleanup job, necessary for the collective societal good of curbing climate change. But it doesn’t produce a service or product that any individual or organization strictly needs—or is especially eager to pay for.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To date, a number of businesses have voluntarily agreed to buy tons of carbon dioxide that companies intend to eventually suck out of the air. But whether they’re motivated by sincere climate concerns or pressures from investors, employees, or customers, corporate do-goodism will only scale any industry so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most observers argue that whether carbon removal continues to bobble along or transforms into something big enough to make a dent in climate change will depend largely on whether governments around the world decide to pay for a whole, whole lot of it—or force polluters to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Private-sector purchases will never get us there,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “We need policy; it has to be policy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carbon removal sector began to scale up in the early part of this decade, as increasingly grave climate studies revealed the need to dramatically cut emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; suck down vast amounts of carbon dioxide to keep global warming in check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, nations may have to continually remove as much as 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by around midcentury to have a solid chance of keeping the planet from warming past 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a UN climate panel report in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A number of startups sprang up to begin developing the technology and building the infrastructure that would be needed, trying out a variety of approaches like sinking seaweed or building carbon-dioxide-sucking factories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI.

Climeworks, one of the first companies to build direct-air-capture (DAC) factories, announced it was laying off 10% of its staff in May, as it grapples with challenges on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company’s plans to collaborate on the development of a major facility in the US have been at least delayed as the Trump administration has held back tens of millions of dollars in funding granted in 2023 under the Department of Energy’s Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. It now appears the government could terminate the funding altogether, along with perhaps tens of billions of dollars’ worth of additional grants previously awarded for a variety of other US carbon removal and climate tech projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Market rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,” Christoph Gebald, one of the company’s co-CEOs, said in a previous statement to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “The need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we’re working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But purchases from direct-air-capture projects fell nearly 16% last year and account for just 8% of all carbon removal transactions to date. Buyers are increasingly looking to categories that promise to deliver tons faster and for less money, notably including burying biochar or installing carbon capture equipment on bioenergy plants. (Read more in my recent story on that method of carbon removal, known as BECCS, here.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CDR.fyi recently described the climate for direct air capture in grim terms: “The sector has grown rapidly, but the honeymoon is over: Investment and sales are falling, while deployments are delayed across almost every company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most DAC companies,” the organization added, “will fold or be acquired.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, most observers believe carbon removal isn’t really going to take off unless governments bring their resources and regulations to bear. That could mean making direct purchases, subsidizing these sectors, or getting polluters to pay the costs to do so—for instance, by folding carbon removal into market-based emissions reductions mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More government support does appear to be on the way. Notably, the European Commission recently proposed allowing “domestic carbon removal” within its EU Emissions Trading System after 2030, integrating the sector into one of the largest cap-and-trade programs. The system forces power plants and other polluters in member countries to increasingly cut their emissions or pay for them over time, as the cap on pollution tightens and the price on carbon rises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That could create incentives for more European companies to pay direct-air-capture or bioenergy facilities to draw down carbon dioxide as a means of helping them meet their climate obligations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also indications that the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN organization that establishes standards for the aviation industry, is considering incorporating carbon removal into its market-based mechanism for reducing the sector’s emissions. That might take several forms, including allowing airlines to purchase carbon removal to offset their use of traditional jet fuel or requiring the use of carbon dioxide obtained through direct air capture in some share of sustainable aviation fuels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Canada has committed to spend $10 million on carbon removal and is developing a protocol to allow direct air capture in its national offsets program. And Japan will begin accepting several categories of carbon removal in its emissions trading system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back funding for the development of carbon-sucking projects, the US does continue to subsidize storage of carbon dioxide, whether it comes from power plants, ethanol refineries, direct-air-capture plants, or other facilities. The so-called 45Q tax credit, which is worth up to $180 a ton, was among the few forms of government support for climate-tech-related sectors that survived in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill. In fact, the subsidies for putting carbon dioxide to other uses increased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even in the current US political climate, Burns is hopeful that local or federal legislators will continue to enact policies that support specific categories of carbon removal in the regions where they make the most sense, because the projects can provide economic growth and jobs as well as climate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think there are lots of models for what carbon removal policy can look like that aren’t just things like tax incentives,” she says. “And I think that this particular political moment gives us the opportunity in a unique way to start to look at what those regionally specific and pathway specific policies look like.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dangers ahead&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even if more nations do provide the money or enact the laws necessary to drive the business of durable carbon renewal forward, there are mounting concerns that a sector conceived as an alternative to dubious offset markets could increasingly come to replicate their problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Various incentives are pulling in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Financial pressures are building on suppliers to deliver tons of carbon removal. Corporate buyers are looking for the fastest and most affordable way of hitting their climate goals. And the organizations that set standards and accredit carbon removal projects often earn more money as the volume of purchases rises, creating clear conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the same carbon registries that have long signed off on carbon offset projects have begun creating standards or issuing credits for various forms of carbon removal, including Verra and Gold Standard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reliable assurance that a project’s declared ton of carbon savings equates to a real ton of emissions removed, reduced, or avoided is crucial,” Cynthia Giles, a senior EPA advisor under President Biden, and Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent editorial in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. “Yet extensive research from many contexts shows that auditors selected and paid by audited organizations often produce results skewed toward those entities’ interests.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Noah McQueen, the director of science and innovation at Carbon180, has stressed that the industry must strive to counter the mounting credibility risks, noting in a recent LinkedIn post: “Growth matters, but growth without integrity isn’t growth at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an interview, McQueen said that heading off the problem will require developing and enforcing standards to truly ensure that carbon removal projects deliver the climate benefits promised. McQueen added that to gain trust, the industry needs to earn buy-in from the communities in which these projects are built and avoid the environmental and health impacts that power plants and heavy industry have historically inflicted on disadvantaged communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Getting it right will require governments to take a larger role in the sector than just subsidizing it, argues David Ho, a professor at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa who focuses&amp;nbsp; on ocean-based carbon removal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says there should be a massive, multinational research drive to determine the most effective ways of mopping up the atmosphere with minimal environmental or social harm, likening it to a Manhattan Project (minus the whole nuclear bomb bit).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If we’re serious about doing this, then let’s make it a government effort,” he says, “so that you can try out all the things, determine what works and what doesn’t, and you don’t have to please your VCs or concentrate on developing [intellectual property] so you can sell yourself to a fossil-fuel company.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ho adds that there’s a moral imperative for the world’s historically biggest climate polluters to build and pay for the carbon-sucking and storage infrastructure required to draw down billions of tons of greenhouse gas. That’s because the world’s poorest, hottest nations, which have contributed the least to climate change, will nevertheless face the greatest dangers from intensifying heat waves, droughts, famines, and sea-level rise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It should be seen as waste management for the waste we’re going to dump on the Global South,” he says, “because they’re the people who will suffer the most from climate change.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/24/1126478/whats-next-for-carbon-removal/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] An AI app to measure pain is here (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/24/1126451/an-ai-app-to-measure-pain-is-here/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pain-scale.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The app, and other tools like it, could help doctors and caregivers.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain can be notoriously difficult to describe, as almost everyone who has ever been asked to will know. &lt;/strong&gt;At a recent medical visit, my doctor asked me to rank my pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I found it incredibly difficult to do. A 10, she said, meant “the worst pain imaginable,” which brought back unpleasant memories of having appendicitis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A short while before the problem that brought me in, I’d broken my toe in two places, which had hurt like a mother—but less than appendicitis. If appendicitis was a 10, breaking a toe was an 8, I figured. If that was the case, maybe my current pain was a 6. As a pain score, it didn’t sound as bad as I actually felt. I couldn’t help wondering if I might have given a higher score if my appendix were still intact. I wondered, too, how someone else with my medical issue might score their pain.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In truth, we all experience pain in our own unique ways.&lt;/strong&gt; Pain is subjective, and it is influenced by our past experiences, our&amp;nbsp;moods, and our expectations. The way people describe their pain can vary tremendously, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve known this for ages. In the 1940s, the anesthesiologist Henry Beecher noted that&amp;nbsp;wounded soldiers were much less likely to ask for pain relief than similarly injured people in civilian hospitals. Perhaps they were putting on a brave face, or maybe they just felt lucky to be alive, given their circumstances. We have no way of knowing how much pain they were really feeling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given this messy picture, I can see the appeal of a simple test that can score pain and help medical professionals understand how best to treat their patients. That’s what is being offered by PainChek, the smartphone app Deena wrote about. The app works by assessing small facial movements, such as lip raises or brow pinches. A user is then required to fill a separate checklist to identify other signs of pain the patient might be displaying. It seems to work well, and it is already being used in hospitals and care settings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the app is judged against subjective reports of pain.&lt;/strong&gt; It might be useful for assessing the pain of people who can’t describe it themselves—perhaps because they have dementia, for example—but it won’t add much to assessments from people who can already communicate their pain levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other complications. Say a test could spot that a person was experiencing pain. What can a doctor do with that information? Perhaps prescribe pain relief—but most of the pain-relieving drugs we have were designed to treat acute, short-term pain. If a person is grimacing from a chronic pain condition, the treatment options are more limited, says Stuart Derbyshire, a pain neuroscientist at the National University of Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The last time I spoke to Derbyshire was back in 2010, when I covered&amp;nbsp;work by researchers in London who were using brain scans to measure pain. That was 15 years ago. But pain-measuring brain scanners are yet to become a routine part of clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That scoring system was also built on subjective pain reports.&lt;/strong&gt; Those reports are, as Derbyshire puts it, “baked into the system.” It’s not ideal, but when it comes down to it, we must rely on these wobbly, malleable, and sometimes incoherent self-descriptions of pain. It’s the best we have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Derbyshire says he doesn’t think we’ll ever have a “pain-o-meter” that can tell you what a person is truly experiencing. “Subjective report is the gold standard, and I think it always will be,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Anthropic now serves more than 300,000 business customers, with large accounts—defined as those representing over US$100,000 in annual run-rate revenue—growing nearly sevenfold in the past year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This customer growth trajectory, concentrated among Fortune 500 companies and AI-native startups, suggests that Claude’s adoption in enterprise environments is accelerating beyond early experimentation phases into production-grade implementations where infrastructure reliability, cost management, and performance consistency become non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-multi-cloud-calculus"&gt;The multi-cloud calculus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes this announcement from typical vendor partnerships is Anthropic’s explicit articulation of a diversified compute strategy. The company operates across three distinct chip platforms: Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, and NVIDIA’s GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFO Krishna Rao emphasised that Amazon remains the primary training partner and cloud provider, with ongoing work on Project Rainier—a massive compute cluster spanning hundreds of thousands of AI chips across multiple US data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology leaders evaluating their own AI infrastructure roadmaps, this multi-platform approach warrants attention. It reflects a pragmatic recognition that no single accelerator architecture or cloud ecosystem optimally serves all workloads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training large language models, fine-tuning for domain-specific applications, serving inference at scale, and conducting alignment research each present different computational profiles, cost structures, and latency requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic implication for CTOs and CIOs is clear: vendor lock-in at the infrastructure layer carries increasing risk as AI workloads mature. Organisations building long-term AI capabilities should evaluate how model providers’ own architectural choices—and their ability to port workloads across platforms—translate into flexibility, pricing leverage, and continuity assurance for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-price-performance-and-the-economics-of-scale"&gt;Price-performance and the economics of scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian attributed Anthropic’s expanded TPU commitment to “strong price-performance and efficiency” demonstrated over several years. While specific benchmark comparisons remain proprietary, the economics underlying this choice matter significantly for enterprise AI budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPUs, purpose-built for tensor operations central to neural network computation, typically offer advantages in throughput and energy efficiency for specific model architectures compared to general-purpose GPUs. The announcement’s reference to “over a gigawatt of capacity” is instructive: power consumption and cooling infrastructure increasingly constrain AI deployment at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises operating on-premises AI infrastructure or negotiating colocation agreements, understanding the total cost of ownership—including facilities, power, and operational overhead—becomes as critical as raw compute pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood and referenced in the announcement, represents Google’s latest iteration in AI accelerator design. While technical specifications remain limited in public documentation, the maturity of Google’s AI accelerator portfolio—developed over nearly a decade—provides a counterpoint to enterprises evaluating newer entrants in the AI chip market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proven production history, extensive tooling integration, and supply chain stability carry weight in enterprise procurement decisions where continuity risk can derail multi-year AI initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-enterprise-ai-strategy"&gt;Implications for enterprise AI strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several strategic considerations emerge from Anthropic’s infrastructure expansion for enterprise leaders planning their own AI investments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity planning and vendor relationships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The scale of this commitment—tens of billions of dollars—illustrates the capital intensity required to serve enterprise AI demand at production scale.

Anthropic now serves more than 300,000 business customers, with large accounts—defined as those representing over US$100,000 in annual run-rate revenue—growing nearly sevenfold in the past year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This customer growth trajectory, concentrated among Fortune 500 companies and AI-native startups, suggests that Claude’s adoption in enterprise environments is accelerating beyond early experimentation phases into production-grade implementations where infrastructure reliability, cost management, and performance consistency become non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-multi-cloud-calculus"&gt;The multi-cloud calculus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes this announcement from typical vendor partnerships is Anthropic’s explicit articulation of a diversified compute strategy. The company operates across three distinct chip platforms: Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, and NVIDIA’s GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFO Krishna Rao emphasised that Amazon remains the primary training partner and cloud provider, with ongoing work on Project Rainier—a massive compute cluster spanning hundreds of thousands of AI chips across multiple US data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology leaders evaluating their own AI infrastructure roadmaps, this multi-platform approach warrants attention. It reflects a pragmatic recognition that no single accelerator architecture or cloud ecosystem optimally serves all workloads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training large language models, fine-tuning for domain-specific applications, serving inference at scale, and conducting alignment research each present different computational profiles, cost structures, and latency requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic implication for CTOs and CIOs is clear: vendor lock-in at the infrastructure layer carries increasing risk as AI workloads mature. Organisations building long-term AI capabilities should evaluate how model providers’ own architectural choices—and their ability to port workloads across platforms—translate into flexibility, pricing leverage, and continuity assurance for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-price-performance-and-the-economics-of-scale"&gt;Price-performance and the economics of scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian attributed Anthropic’s expanded TPU commitment to “strong price-performance and efficiency” demonstrated over several years. While specific benchmark comparisons remain proprietary, the economics underlying this choice matter significantly for enterprise AI budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPUs, purpose-built for tensor operations central to neural network computation, typically offer advantages in throughput and energy efficiency for specific model architectures compared to general-purpose GPUs. The announcement’s reference to “over a gigawatt of capacity” is instructive: power consumption and cooling infrastructure increasingly constrain AI deployment at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises operating on-premises AI infrastructure or negotiating colocation agreements, understanding the total cost of ownership—including facilities, power, and operational overhead—becomes as critical as raw compute pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood and referenced in the announcement, represents Google’s latest iteration in AI accelerator design. While technical specifications remain limited in public documentation, the maturity of Google’s AI accelerator portfolio—developed over nearly a decade—provides a counterpoint to enterprises evaluating newer entrants in the AI chip market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proven production history, extensive tooling integration, and supply chain stability carry weight in enterprise procurement decisions where continuity risk can derail multi-year AI initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-enterprise-ai-strategy"&gt;Implications for enterprise AI strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several strategic considerations emerge from Anthropic’s infrastructure expansion for enterprise leaders planning their own AI investments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity planning and vendor relationships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The scale of this commitment—tens of billions of dollars—illustrates the capital intensity required to serve enterprise AI demand at production scale. Organisations relying on foundation model APIs should assess their providers’ capacity roadmaps and diversification strategies to mitigate service availability risks during demand spikes or geopolitical supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment and safety testing at scale:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic explicitly connects this expanded infrastructure to “more thorough testing, alignment research, and responsible deployment.” For enterprises in regulated industries—financial services, healthcare, government contracting—the computational resources dedicated to safety and alignment directly impact model reliability and compliance posture.

Even the best AI isn’t helpful if it can’t access the info needed to do a job. OpenAI points out that the info you need is often in your internal tools, but that knowledge is scattered across documents, files, messages, emails, tickets, and project trackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scattering is more than just annoying; it hurts efficiency and decisionmaking. The main problem is that these tools don’t always connect, and the best answer is often spread across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts OpenAI up against the AI strategies of big enterprise platforms like Microsoft’s Copilot in Azure and Office 365, Google’s Vertex AI, Salesforce’s Agentforce, and AWS Bedrock.
