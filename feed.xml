Can it keep it? (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-9.34.51PM.png?resize=1200,668" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While AI coding startups like Cursor close brow-raising rounds on barely three years of existence, Replit’s path to a $3 billion valuation has been anything but swift. For CEO Amjad Masad, who’s been building tools to democratize programming since 2009, it’s a story of muscling through multiple failed business models, years stuck at the same revenue plateau, and a reckoning last year that forced him to cut half his staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes what happened next more remarkable. Earlier this month, the Bay Area-based company closed a $250 million funding round led by Prysm Capital, nearly tripling its valuation from 2023. The raise came on the heels of never-before-seen revenue growth for the company — from just $2.8 million last year to $150 million in annualized revenue in less than a year. But for Masad, this moment represents something more than finally realizing financial traction. It’s the culmination of a 16-year obsession.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our mission has always been the same,” Masad told me on the newest episode of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. “Initially, we said we want to make programming more accessible, and then we sort of upped the ante a little bit. We said we’re going to create a billion programmers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s purposely audacious – what a headline! – but it’s also something that Masad, a Palestinian-Jordanian, has been working toward for his entire career. As he tells it, he came to the United States in 2012 after his open-source coding project began gaining attention – including catching the eye of the New York Times. But he’d been making programming more accessible since building his first online coding experience back in 2009, with his work as an early engineer at the startup Codecademy kicking off what became the massively online open courses (MOOC) revolution. (His code also powered the in-browser tutorials of Udacity, a Codecademy rival that launched in 2012, one year after Codecademy was founded.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, turning that vision into a viable business of his own proved a lot harder than he anticipated. Replit was founded in 2016, and for eight long years, the company struggled to find product-market fit. “We had reached that $2.83 million [in annual recurring revenue] back in ’21, maybe,” Masad recalled. “And so this is how painful it’s been. We’ve been hovering around the same revenue for like four or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company tried selling to schools (“incredibly difficult,” Masad noted), cycling through different business models, and watched each one stabilize around the same modest revenue level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Along the way, Replit built sophisticated infrastructure for cloud development environments and “multiplayer coding,” collaborative editing akin to Google Docs but for programming. But the technical achievement wasn’t translating into revenue growth, and by last year, with the company at 130 employees and burning through cash, Masad said he had to make a painful decision. “I looked at our burn, and I looked at our progress on our revenue chart, and it just didn’t make any sense. The business wasn’t viable.” Replit cut its headcount by 50%, bringing it down to around 60 to 70 people at its lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then came the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last fall, Replit launched Replit Agent, which Masad calls “the first agent-based coding experience in the world” that can’t just write code but “debug it, deploy, provision the database for you, just act as a true software engineering partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soon after, in January of this year, he announced that Replit was abandoning professional developers as its core market.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hacker News was really unhappy,” Masad acknowledged when we talked. But he also hasn’t looked back, completely moving away from competing in the crowded market of tools for professional developers – where companies like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others are battling it out – to instead focus on creating a billion software developers from white-collar employees with no technical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The idea of making programming more accessible to the average individual, to the knowledge worker, really, that’s where we think our market is,” Masad explains. “It’s a fundamentally new market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, that bet looks very smart. Numerous reports this summer said that revenue at Replit had grown to over $150 million in annualized revenue and Masad hinted that it’s now even higher. He also said that unlike many AI-powered coding companies, Replit is gross margin positive. On enterprise deals, which make up an increasing share of revenue, margins are “80% to 90%,” according to Masad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s hard to verify such a claim, but Replit’s market position received some validation this week when Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with fintech firm Mercury. Analyzing transaction data from Mercury, the report tracked the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are actually spending money on. While major labs OpenAI and Anthropic took the top two spots, Replit landed at No. 3, outranking every other development tool. (Worth noting: Andreessen Horowitz has invested in multiple rounds of funding for Replit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Profitability is rare in AI coding because many competitors face what Masad calls “the negative gross margin trap.” The reality is that serving professional developers with AI assistance can be compute-intensive. Counterintuitively, Replit’s focus on non-technical users – who might seem like they’d require more AI assistance – works in their favor on the business model front for enterprise customers like Zillow, Duolingo, and Coinbase, which pay $100 per seat, plus usage-based pricing built on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This new path hasn’t been without some faceplants. In July, venture capitalist Jason Lemkin went viral after the newest version of Replit’s AI agent deleted his production database with 100-plus executive contacts, fabricating 4,000 fake records afterward and later admitting to Lemkin that it “panicked.” (There is a failure mode in AI agents called reward hacking, where models become so obsessed with achieving a certain goal that they effectively cheat when they miss the mark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than becoming defensive, Masad and his team owned the problem. In fact, says Masad, within two days, they rolled out an automatic safety system that separates a user’s “practice” database from their “real” one. The way Masad describes it, it’s a little like having two versions of a website’s filing cabinet — the AI agent can experiment freely in a development database, but the production database, which is the real thing that users interact with, is completely walled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Masad told me the incident ultimately put the company on stronger footing, given the problems around safety and security it needed to figure out — and fast. “If you solve hard problems, then you have a technology moat,” he said. (Lemkin, for his part, says he has become a super user of Replit despite having no technical background just months ago.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, even now, Replit isn’t out of the woods. If anything, its success has painted a target on its back. To wit, the company — which now employs 110 people — still faces an existential threat from the very AI labs whose models power its platform: Anthropic and OpenAI. Both companies have launched their own coding tools that compete directly with companies like Replit and Cursor, and these foundation model companies can afford to subsidize their coding tools and post-train their models on their own products, optimizing performance in ways that third-party platforms might always struggle to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Replit’s advantage, according to Masad, lies in targeting non-technical users rather than professional developers, plus the sophisticated infrastructure around deployment and database management that it has built and which foundation model companies still don’t prioritize (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Replit has another unusual advantage for a startup: a $350 million war chest. Despite raising $100 million in 2023, the company “hadn’t touched” those funds by the time it raised this latest round, Masad told me. The company is capital efficient by design, though Masad joked that as an entrepreneur who grew up watching his refugee father struggle, “one thing I need to learn is to be less frugal and start spending money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether that edge keeps Replit ahead of competitors is an open question, and it’s one about which Masad is mindful. Right now, the plan is to scale operations, accelerate product development, and pursue acquisitions — both acqui-hires and potentially companies working on agent automation in specific verticals. But for Masad, who appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast in July and has seen his company’s fortunes transform, the moment is bittersweet. When asked how it feels to be receiving so much attention – not to mention that $3 billion valuation – he invoked the adage that “this too shall pass. This might mean that when you’re in a bad situation, that’ll pass, but we’re also in a good situation that will pass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a stoic response from someone who spent the better part of a decade working away at the same revenue level, convinced that AI agents would eventually transform programming but unable to prove it to the market. But one major difference between Replit and the wave of AI coding startups now flooding the market is that Masad has lived through multiple hype cycles and has he emerged with something relatively differentiated – and reportedly profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve learned to be a little stoic,” he said. “What matters is for us to do the right thing, be principled, and move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-9.34.51PM.png?resize=1200,668" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While AI coding startups like Cursor close brow-raising rounds on barely three years of existence, Replit’s path to a $3 billion valuation has been anything but swift.

As supporters cheered in waves of blue and white, capturing moments on their phones and sharing videos (despite the crushing crowd density), China Mobile Shanghai’s newly deployed 5G-A network monetisation strategy was being tested in real-time, powered by Huawei’s GainLeap solution and intelligent wireless infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the media section, the scale of the technical challenge became apparent – ensuring 80,000 simultaneous users could stream, upload, and transact without network degradation. This was something that required more than additional bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Mobile Shanghai has become the first carrier in China to launch a differentiated 5G-A experience package, marking what industry observers see as a shift in how telecom operators might address revenue growth in saturated markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “5G-A Exclusive Package for Shenhua Football Fans” is a way to transform the elastic capabilities of 5G-Advanced networks into tangible value that users can perceive and are willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical foundation for this 5G-A network monetisation strategy relies heavily on Huawei’s technology portfolio, from the GainLeap solution that identifies premium subscribers, to the AI-powered intelligent wireless boards that optimise network performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The business model innovation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership between China Mobile Shanghai and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club offers approximately 200,000 football fans an annual package that combines network performance guarantees with fan-specific benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribers receive network acceleration on 5G-A, access to all matches via the Migu streaming service, unlimited video ringback tone downloads, and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach to 5G-A network monetisation addresses what China Mobile Shanghai identifies as an important pain point for the telecommunications industry: how to drive quality growth when user acquisition has reached its ceiling. Rather than competing solely on price or basic connectivity, the package creates value through enhanced experiences in specific use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The technical infrastructure behind the experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shanghai Stadium, China Mobile Shanghai implemented an elastic, scalable network capable of handling massive concurrent demand. During the match, with 80,000 users accessing the network simultaneously, 5G-A package subscribers can achieve download speeds of up to 600 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The necessary technical foundation relies on Huawei’s GainLeap solution, which lets the network identify 5G-A subscribers and allocates them a high-speed 3CC (three-component carrier) channel. The differentiation is key to the 5G-A network monetisation model – creating measurable performance differences between standard and premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Huawei’s AI-powered intelligent wireless boards play a central role. They integrate on-board communications capabilities with artificial intelligence to perceive network service types, user experience goals, device characteristics, and resource status, in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to test data provided by China Mobile Shanghai, they have helped result in QR code scanning latency reduced by 47%, WeChat uploading time shortened by 25%, live streaming speeds increased by 27%, and high-definition video ratios increased by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure deployment scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the high concurrent demand during events, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei conducted comprehensive network upgrades at the stadium. The lower stands received 32 new 2.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz pRRUs (passive remote radio units), more than doubling overall network capacity. Seven escalator entrances each received a 4.9 GHz EM device to eliminate coverage dead spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On match days, more than 40 engineers are stationed onsite for real-time network monitoring and dynamic optimisation. Outside of the stadium, China Mobile Shanghai has achieved continuous 5G-A coverage in the area inside Shanghai’s Outer Ring Road, the five new towns further out, and 21 metro lines in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The practical user experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans at the match, the differentiated service manifested practically. The high bandwidth and business-level assurance capabilities enabled quick mobile payments for drinks, snacks, and souvenirs onsite. Users could share video highlights in real time without lag, even during peak moments when thousands of fans uploaded data simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to instantly see likes and comments from friends while still in the stadium represents the kind of enhanced experience that China Mobile Shanghai is betting users will value enough to pay a premium for. Whether this bet pays off commercially remains to be seen, but the technical execution at the September 21 match demonstrated that the infrastructure delivers on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative raises questions about the future of 5G-A network monetisation strategies in the telecommunications industry.

As supporters cheered in waves of blue and white, capturing moments on their phones and sharing videos (despite the crushing crowd density), China Mobile Shanghai’s newly deployed 5G-A network monetisation strategy was being tested in real-time, powered by Huawei’s GainLeap solution and intelligent wireless infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the media section, the scale of the technical challenge became apparent – ensuring 80,000 simultaneous users could stream, upload, and transact without network degradation. This was something that required more than additional bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Mobile Shanghai has become the first carrier in China to launch a differentiated 5G-A experience package, marking what industry observers see as a shift in how telecom operators might address revenue growth in saturated markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “5G-A Exclusive Package for Shenhua Football Fans” is a way to transform the elastic capabilities of 5G-Advanced networks into tangible value that users can perceive and are willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical foundation for this 5G-A network monetisation strategy relies heavily on Huawei’s technology portfolio, from the GainLeap solution that identifies premium subscribers, to the AI-powered intelligent wireless boards that optimise network performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The business model innovation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership between China Mobile Shanghai and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club offers approximately 200,000 football fans an annual package that combines network performance guarantees with fan-specific benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribers receive network acceleration on 5G-A, access to all matches via the Migu streaming service, unlimited video ringback tone downloads, and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach to 5G-A network monetisation addresses what China Mobile Shanghai identifies as an important pain point for the telecommunications industry: how to drive quality growth when user acquisition has reached its ceiling. Rather than competing solely on price or basic connectivity, the package creates value through enhanced experiences in specific use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The technical infrastructure behind the experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shanghai Stadium, China Mobile Shanghai implemented an elastic, scalable network capable of handling massive concurrent demand. During the match, with 80,000 users accessing the network simultaneously, 5G-A package subscribers can achieve download speeds of up to 600 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The necessary technical foundation relies on Huawei’s GainLeap solution, which lets the network identify 5G-A subscribers and allocates them a high-speed 3CC (three-component carrier) channel. The differentiation is key to the 5G-A network monetisation model – creating measurable performance differences between standard and premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Huawei’s AI-powered intelligent wireless boards play a central role. They integrate on-board communications capabilities with artificial intelligence to perceive network service types, user experience goals, device characteristics, and resource status, in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to test data provided by China Mobile Shanghai, they have helped result in QR code scanning latency reduced by 47%, WeChat uploading time shortened by 25%, live streaming speeds increased by 27%, and high-definition video ratios increased by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure deployment scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the high concurrent demand during events, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei conducted comprehensive network upgrades at the stadium. The lower stands received 32 new 2.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz pRRUs (passive remote radio units), more than doubling overall network capacity. Seven escalator entrances each received a 4.9 GHz EM device to eliminate coverage dead spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On match days, more than 40 engineers are stationed onsite for real-time network monitoring and dynamic optimisation. Outside of the stadium, China Mobile Shanghai has achieved continuous 5G-A coverage in the area inside Shanghai’s Outer Ring Road, the five new towns further out, and 21 metro lines in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The practical user experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans at the match, the differentiated service manifested practically. The high bandwidth and business-level assurance capabilities enabled quick mobile payments for drinks, snacks, and souvenirs onsite. Users could share video highlights in real time without lag, even during peak moments when thousands of fans uploaded data simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to instantly see likes and comments from friends while still in the stadium represents the kind of enhanced experience that China Mobile Shanghai is betting users will value enough to pay a premium for. Whether this bet pays off commercially remains to be seen, but the technical execution at the September 21 match demonstrated that the infrastructure delivers on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industry implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative raises questions about the future of 5G-A network monetisation strategies in the telecommunications industry. Traditional models have struggled to justify the massive infrastructure investments required for 5G and latterly, 5G-Advanced networks. By creating tiered experiences tied to specific user communities – in this case, football fans – carriers may have found a way to differentiate services beyond simple speed tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach also represents a test case for how deeply integrated AI capabilities in network infrastructure can enable new business models. The intelligent wireless boards’ ability to make millisecond-level decisions about resource allocation is what makes the performance differentiation technically feasible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Mobile Shanghai’s target of serving 200,000 Shenhua fans provides a measurable benchmark for assessing commercial viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As telecommunications companies globally grapple with how to monetise increasingly expensive network upgrades, China Mobile Shanghai’s experiment with community-specific, experience-based packages may offer insights for the industry’s evolution beyond traditional connectivity provision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: Smart Shanghai &lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lil-artist"&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3047762" height="451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot_3x_postspark_2025-09-01_01-19-08.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lil Artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daylish"&gt;Daylish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moneycoach"&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of financial tracking app MoneyCoach where the screen shows summary of accounts and shows a weekly insight on grocery spend for the week. " class="wp-image-3047763" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01-Foundation-Models-Insights.jpeg?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoneyCoach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lookup"&gt;LookUp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of LookUp word learning app that shows a screen that displays an example to understand a new word " class="wp-image-3047764" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Learn-Modes-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;LookUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Lookup app with a map view showing origin of a word." class="wp-image-3047765" height="400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Etymology-Maps-2.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="This is a lifestyle shot of Tasks app showing screen with a new feautre that uses local models to suggest tags when you enter a task." class="wp-image-3047766" height="407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tasks-app.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-day-one"&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Day One journaling app's features implemented using Apple's local model. These features include a summary, title suggestion, and prompt generation to go deeper into writing. " class="wp-image-3047759" height="625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/On-Device-AI-scaled-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Day One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crouton"&gt;Crouton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-noise"&gt;Dark Noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lights-out"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capture"&gt;Capture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050861" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Capture.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lumy"&gt;Lumy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050860" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Lumy_image_iPhone_109_cef6.png?w=340" width="340" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Lumy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardpointers"&gt;CardPointers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3050862" height="463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CardPointers-for-Credit-Cards_image_iPhone_105_eb71.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;CardPointers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guitar-wiz"&gt;Guitar Wiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it.
