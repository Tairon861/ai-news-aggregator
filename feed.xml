It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Many of the upgrades are made with an eye toward agentic use cases, particularly scenarios in which Opus acts as a lead agent commanding a group of Haiku-powered sub-agents. Managing those tasks requires a strong command of working memory, which is where the memory improvements described by Penn really show their worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is where fundamentals like memory become really important,” Penn says, “because Claude needs to be able to explore code bases and large documents, and also know when to backtrack and recheck something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opus 4.5 will face stiff competition from other recently released frontier models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT 5.1 (released on November 12) and Google’s Gemini 3 (released November 18).&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Claude-Opus-4.5-illustration.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Monday, Anthropic announced Opus 4.5, the latest version of its flagship model.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS announced Monday it is investing $50 billion to build AI “high-performance computing infrastructure” purposefully built for the U.S. government. The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies in January. OpenAI announced a deal in August that gave government agencies access to the enterprise tier of ChatGPT for just $1 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That same month, Anthropic announced it was also giving the U.S. government access to the enterprise tiers of its Claude chatbot for $1.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko, is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “&lt;em&gt;An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stickerbox, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070381" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510" width="510" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer"&gt;Testing the AI sticker printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070370" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stickerbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is BPS and BPA-free, making it safe to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070382" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676" width="676" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean. (This is particularly useful given that kids don’t tend to explain things in a straightforward fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-ai-for-kids"&gt;Making “AI for kids”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hapiko, the company behind Stickerbox, was founded this year by CEO Arun Gupta and CTO Robert (Bob) Whitney. The pair originally met while working at the e-commerce marketplace Grailed, where Whitney was director of engineering and Gupta was CEO. (The company sold to GOAT Group in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before Grailed, Gupta founded and launched the Y Combinator-backed hardware sleep tracker WakeMate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070368" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?w=617" width="617" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Stickerbox co-founders Arun Gupta (CEO) and Bob Whitney (CTO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stickerbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whitney, meanwhile, had worked as the director of engineering at The New York Times’ Games division, as the publisher pivoted from offering just crosswords to becoming a full-fledged gaming app, acquiring Wordle and launching other games like Connections and Strads. While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070376" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453" width="453" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-built-for-updates"&gt;Built for updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a Wi-Fi-connected device, Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features. In tests, for instance, we were able to print some recognizable characters, but a more recent update added new guardrails to guide kids toward more original designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A soon-to-launch companion app also lets you view past creations and save favorites, and could ultimately serve as the home for premium features.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stickerbox is backed by $7 million in funding from Maveron, Serena Williams’ Serena Ventures, the Allen Institute’s AI2 incubator, and various angels, including Matt Brezina, and product leaders from other consumer apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;There’s a new AI-powered toy for kids called Stickerbox, and, before you groan, I’m here to report that it’s surprisingly fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko, is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “&lt;em&gt;An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stickerbox, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070381" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510" width="510" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer"&gt;Testing the AI sticker printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070370" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stickerbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is BPS and BPA-free, making it safe to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070382" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676" width="676" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean. (This is particularly useful given that kids don’t tend to explain things in a straightforward fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-ai-for-kids"&gt;Making “AI for kids”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hapiko, the company behind Stickerbox, was founded this year by CEO Arun Gupta and CTO Robert (Bob) Whitney. The pair originally met while working at the e-commerce marketplace Grailed, where Whitney was director of engineering and Gupta was CEO. (The company sold to GOAT Group in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before Grailed, Gupta founded and launched the Y Combinator-backed hardware sleep tracker WakeMate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070368" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?w=617" width="617" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Stickerbox co-founders Arun Gupta (CEO) and Bob Whitney (CTO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Stickerbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whitney, meanwhile, had worked as the director of engineering at The New York Times’ Games division, as the publisher pivoted from offering just crosswords to becoming a full-fledged gaming app, acquiring Wordle and launching other games like Connections and Strads. While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070376" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453" width="453" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-built-for-updates"&gt;Built for updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.&lt;/p&gt;

The result underscores both the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI systems and growing questions about how the technology will reshape white-collar professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon-backed company is pricing Claude Opus 4.5 at &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;$5 per million input tokens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;$25 per million output tokens&lt;/a&gt; — a dramatic reduction from the $15 and $75 rates for its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1"&gt;Claude Opus 4.1&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year. The move makes frontier AI capabilities accessible to a broader swath of developers and enterprises while putting pressure on competitors to match both performance and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We want to make sure this really works for people who want to work with these models,&amp;quot; said Alex Albert, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s head of developer relations, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;That is really our focus: How can we enable Claude to be better at helping you do the things that you don&amp;#x27;t necessarily want to do in your job?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as Anthropic races to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field. OpenAI recently released &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/"&gt;GPT-5.1&lt;/a&gt; and a specialized coding model called &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/"&gt;Codex Max&lt;/a&gt; that can work autonomously for extended periods. Google unveiled &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/"&gt;Gemini 3&lt;/a&gt; just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-braces-possible-economic-headwinds-catching-resurgent-google"&gt;prompting concerns even from OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; about the search giant&amp;#x27;s progress, according to a recent report from The Information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opus 4.5 demonstrates improved judgment on real-world tasks, developers say&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s internal testing revealed what the company describes as a qualitative leap in Claude Opus 4.5&amp;#x27;s reasoning capabilities. The model achieved 80.9% accuracy on &lt;a href="https://www.swebench.com/"&gt;SWE-bench Verified&lt;/a&gt;, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering tasks, outperforming OpenAI&amp;#x27;s GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (77.9%), Anthropic&amp;#x27;s own Sonnet 4.5 (77.2%), and Google&amp;#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro (76.2%), according to the company&amp;#x27;s data. The result marks a notable advance over OpenAI&amp;#x27;s current state-of-the-art model, which was released just five days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the technical benchmarks tell only part of the story. Albert said employee testers consistently reported that the model demonstrates improved judgment and intuition across diverse tasks — a shift he described as the model developing a sense of what matters in real-world contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The model just kind of gets it,&amp;quot; Albert said. &amp;quot;It just has developed this sort of intuition and judgment on a lot of real world things that feels qualitatively like a big jump up from past models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to his own workflow as an example. Previously, Albert said, he would ask AI models to gather information but hesitated to trust their synthesis or prioritization. With Opus 4.5, he&amp;#x27;s delegating more complete tasks, connecting it to Slack and internal documents to produce coherent summaries that match his priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opus 4.5 outscores all human candidates on company&amp;#x27;s toughest engineering test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model&amp;#x27;s performance on Anthropic&amp;#x27;s internal engineering assessment marks a notable milestone. The take-home exam, designed for prospective performance engineering candidates, is meant to evaluate technical ability and judgment under time pressure within a prescribed two-hour limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a technique called parallel test-time compute — which aggregates multiple attempts from the model and selects the best result — &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; scored higher than any human candidate who has taken the test, according to company. Without a time limit, the model matched the performance of the best-ever human candidate when used within Claude Code, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s coding environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company acknowledged that the test doesn&amp;#x27;t measure other crucial professional skills such as collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years of experience. Still, Anthropic said the result &amp;quot;raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert emphasized the significance of the finding. &amp;quot;I think this is kind of a sign, maybe, of what&amp;#x27;s to come around how useful these models can actually be in a work context and for our jobs,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Of course, this was an engineering task, and I would say models are relatively ahead in engineering compared to other fields, but I think it&amp;#x27;s a really important signal to pay attention to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dramatic efficiency improvements cut token usage by up to 76% on key benchmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond raw performance, Anthropic is betting that efficiency improvements will differentiate &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; in the market. The company says the model uses dramatically fewer tokens — the units of text that AI systems process — to achieve similar or better outcomes compared to predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches the previous &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;Sonnet 4.5&lt;/a&gt; model&amp;#x27;s best score on &lt;a href="https://www.swebench.com/"&gt;SWE-bench Verified&lt;/a&gt; while using 76% fewer output tokens, according to Anthropic. At the highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points while still using 48% fewer tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give developers more control, Anthropic introduced an &amp;quot;effort parameter&amp;quot; that allows users to adjust how much computational work the model applies to each task — balancing performance against latency and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers provided early validation of the efficiency claims. &amp;quot;Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems,&amp;quot; said Michele Catasta, president of Replit, a cloud-based coding platform, in a statement to VentureBeat. &amp;quot;At scale, that efficiency compounds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub&amp;#x27;s chief product officer, Mario Rodriguez, said early testing shows Opus 4.5 &amp;quot;surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early customers report AI agents that learn from experience and refine their own skills&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking capabilities demonstrated by early customers involves what Anthropic calls &amp;quot;self-improving agents&amp;quot; — AI systems that can refine their own performance through iterative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rakuten.com/"&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, the Japanese e-commerce and internet company, tested Claude Opus 4.5 on automation of office tasks. &amp;quot;Our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities — achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn&amp;#x27;t match that quality after 10,&amp;quot; said Yusuke Kaji, Rakuten&amp;#x27;s general manager of AI for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert explained that the model isn&amp;#x27;t updating its own weights — the fundamental parameters that define an AI system&amp;#x27;s behavior — but rather iteratively improving the tools and approaches it uses to solve problems. &amp;quot;It was iteratively refining a skill for a task and seeing that it&amp;#x27;s trying to optimize the skill to get better performance so it could accomplish this task,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capability extends beyond coding. Albert said Anthropic has observed significant improvements in creating professional documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. &amp;quot;They&amp;#x27;re saying that this has been the biggest jump they&amp;#x27;ve seen between model generations,&amp;quot; Albert said. &amp;quot;So going even from Sonnet 4.5 to Opus 4.5, bigger jump than any two models back to back in the past.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fundamentalresearchlabs.com/"&gt;Fundamental Research Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a financial modeling firm, reported that &amp;quot;accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable,&amp;quot; according to co-founder Nico Christie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;New features target Excel users, Chrome workflows and eliminate chat length limits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the model release, Anthropic rolled out a suite of product updates aimed at enterprise users. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-rolls-out-claude-ai-for-finance-integrates-with-excel-to-rival"&gt;Claude for Excel&lt;/a&gt; became generally available for Max, Team, and Enterprise users with new support for pivot tables, charts, and file uploads. The Chrome browser extension is now available to all Max users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most significantly, Anthropic introduced &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;infinite chats&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — a feature that eliminates context window limitations by automatically summarizing earlier parts of conversations as they grow longer. &amp;quot;Within Claude AI, within the product itself, you effectively get this kind of infinite context window due to the compaction, plus some memory things that we&amp;#x27;re doing,&amp;quot; Albert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, Anthropic released &amp;quot;programmatic tool calling,&amp;quot; which allows Claude to write and execute code that invokes functions directly. Claude Code gained an updated &amp;quot;Plan Mode&amp;quot; and became available on desktop in research preview, enabling developers to run multiple AI agent sessions in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market heats up as OpenAI, Google race to match performance and pricing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic reached &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/anthropic-ai-credit-facility.html"&gt;$2 billion in annualized revenue &lt;/a&gt;during the first quarter of 2025, more than doubling from $1 billion in the prior period.

&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropic.com/"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; released its most capable artificial intelligence model yet on Monday, slashing prices by roughly two-thirds while claiming state-of-the-art performance on software engineering tasks — a strategic move that intensifies the AI startup&amp;#x27;s competition with deep-pocketed rivals OpenAI and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt;, scored higher on Anthropic&amp;#x27;s most challenging internal engineering assessment than any human job candidate in the company&amp;#x27;s history, according to materials reviewed by VentureBeat. The result underscores both the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI systems and growing questions about how the technology will reshape white-collar professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon-backed company is pricing Claude Opus 4.5 at &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;$5 per million input tokens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;$25 per million output tokens&lt;/a&gt; — a dramatic reduction from the $15 and $75 rates for its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1"&gt;Claude Opus 4.1&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year. The move makes frontier AI capabilities accessible to a broader swath of developers and enterprises while putting pressure on competitors to match both performance and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We want to make sure this really works for people who want to work with these models,&amp;quot; said Alex Albert, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s head of developer relations, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;That is really our focus: How can we enable Claude to be better at helping you do the things that you don&amp;#x27;t necessarily want to do in your job?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as Anthropic races to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field. OpenAI recently released &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/"&gt;GPT-5.1&lt;/a&gt; and a specialized coding model called &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/"&gt;Codex Max&lt;/a&gt; that can work autonomously for extended periods. Google unveiled &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/"&gt;Gemini 3&lt;/a&gt; just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-braces-possible-economic-headwinds-catching-resurgent-google"&gt;prompting concerns even from OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; about the search giant&amp;#x27;s progress, according to a recent report from The Information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opus 4.5 demonstrates improved judgment on real-world tasks, developers say&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s internal testing revealed what the company describes as a qualitative leap in Claude Opus 4.5&amp;#x27;s reasoning capabilities. The model achieved 80.9% accuracy on &lt;a href="https://www.swebench.com/"&gt;SWE-bench Verified&lt;/a&gt;, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering tasks, outperforming OpenAI&amp;#x27;s GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (77.9%), Anthropic&amp;#x27;s own Sonnet 4.5 (77.2%), and Google&amp;#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro (76.2%), according to the company&amp;#x27;s data. The result marks a notable advance over OpenAI&amp;#x27;s current state-of-the-art model, which was released just five days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the technical benchmarks tell only part of the story. Albert said employee testers consistently reported that the model demonstrates improved judgment and intuition across diverse tasks — a shift he described as the model developing a sense of what matters in real-world contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The model just kind of gets it,&amp;quot; Albert said. &amp;quot;It just has developed this sort of intuition and judgment on a lot of real world things that feels qualitatively like a big jump up from past models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to his own workflow as an example. Previously, Albert said, he would ask AI models to gather information but hesitated to trust their synthesis or prioritization. With Opus 4.5, he&amp;#x27;s delegating more complete tasks, connecting it to Slack and internal documents to produce coherent summaries that match his priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opus 4.5 outscores all human candidates on company&amp;#x27;s toughest engineering test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model&amp;#x27;s performance on Anthropic&amp;#x27;s internal engineering assessment marks a notable milestone. The take-home exam, designed for prospective performance engineering candidates, is meant to evaluate technical ability and judgment under time pressure within a prescribed two-hour limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a technique called parallel test-time compute — which aggregates multiple attempts from the model and selects the best result — &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; scored higher than any human candidate who has taken the test, according to company. Without a time limit, the model matched the performance of the best-ever human candidate when used within Claude Code, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s coding environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company acknowledged that the test doesn&amp;#x27;t measure other crucial professional skills such as collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years of experience. Still, Anthropic said the result &amp;quot;raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert emphasized the significance of the finding. &amp;quot;I think this is kind of a sign, maybe, of what&amp;#x27;s to come around how useful these models can actually be in a work context and for our jobs,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Of course, this was an engineering task, and I would say models are relatively ahead in engineering compared to other fields, but I think it&amp;#x27;s a really important signal to pay attention to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dramatic efficiency improvements cut token usage by up to 76% on key benchmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond raw performance, Anthropic is betting that efficiency improvements will differentiate &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; in the market. The company says the model uses dramatically fewer tokens — the units of text that AI systems process — to achieve similar or better outcomes compared to predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches the previous &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;Sonnet 4.5&lt;/a&gt; model&amp;#x27;s best score on &lt;a href="https://www.swebench.com/"&gt;SWE-bench Verified&lt;/a&gt; while using 76% fewer output tokens, according to Anthropic. At the highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points while still using 48% fewer tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give developers more control, Anthropic introduced an &amp;quot;effort parameter&amp;quot; that allows users to adjust how much computational work the model applies to each task — balancing performance against latency and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers provided early validation of the efficiency claims. &amp;quot;Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems,&amp;quot; said Michele Catasta, president of Replit, a cloud-based coding platform, in a statement to VentureBeat. &amp;quot;At scale, that efficiency compounds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub&amp;#x27;s chief product officer, Mario Rodriguez, said early testing shows Opus 4.5 &amp;quot;surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early customers report AI agents that learn from experience and refine their own skills&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking capabilities demonstrated by early customers involves what Anthropic calls &amp;quot;self-improving agents&amp;quot; — AI systems that can refine their own performance through iterative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rakuten.com/"&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, the Japanese e-commerce and internet company, tested Claude Opus 4.5 on automation of office tasks. &amp;quot;Our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities — achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn&amp;#x27;t match that quality after 10,&amp;quot; said Yusuke Kaji, Rakuten&amp;#x27;s general manager of AI for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert explained that the model isn&amp;#x27;t updating its own weights — the fundamental parameters that define an AI system&amp;#x27;s behavior — but rather iteratively improving the tools and approaches it uses to solve problems. &amp;quot;It was iteratively refining a skill for a task and seeing that it&amp;#x27;s trying to optimize the skill to get better performance so it could accomplish this task,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capability extends beyond coding. Albert said Anthropic has observed significant improvements in creating professional documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. &amp;quot;They&amp;#x27;re saying that this has been the biggest jump they&amp;#x27;ve seen between model generations,&amp;quot; Albert said. &amp;quot;So going even from Sonnet 4.5 to Opus 4.5, bigger jump than any two models back to back in the past.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fundamentalresearchlabs.com/"&gt;Fundamental Research Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a financial modeling firm, reported that &amp;quot;accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable,&amp;quot; according to co-founder Nico Christie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;New features target Excel users, Chrome workflows and eliminate chat length limits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the model release, Anthropic rolled out a suite of product updates aimed at enterprise users. &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-rolls-out-claude-ai-for-finance-integrates-with-excel-to-rival"&gt;Claude for Excel&lt;/a&gt; became generally available for Max, Team, and Enterprise users with new support for pivot tables, charts, and file uploads. The Chrome browser extension is now available to all Max users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most significantly, Anthropic introduced &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5"&gt;infinite chats&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — a feature that eliminates context window limitations by automatically summarizing earlier parts of conversations as they grow longer. &amp;quot;Within Claude AI, within the product itself, you effectively get this kind of infinite context window due to the compaction, plus some memory things that we&amp;#x27;re doing,&amp;quot; Albert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, Anthropic released &amp;quot;programmatic tool calling,&amp;quot; which allows Claude to write and execute code that invokes functions directly. Claude Code gained an updated &amp;quot;Plan Mode&amp;quot; and became available on desktop in research preview, enabling developers to run multiple AI agent sessions in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market heats up as OpenAI, Google race to match performance and pricing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic reached &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/16/anthropic-ai-credit-facility.html"&gt;$2 billion in annualized revenue &lt;/a&gt;during the first quarter of 2025, more than doubling from $1 billion in the prior period.

            &lt;p&gt;There is growing attention on the links between artificial intelligence and increased energy demands. But while the power-hungry data centers being built to support AI could potentially stress electricity grids, increase customer prices and service interruptions, and generally slow the transition to clean energy, the use of artificial intelligence can also help the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, use of AI is reducing energy consumption and associated emissions in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes. In addition, AI is helping to optimize the design and siting of new wind and solar installations and energy storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On electric power grids, using AI algorithms to control operations is helping to increase efficiency and reduce costs, integrate the growing share of renewables, and even predict when key equipment needs servicing to prevent failure and possible blackouts. AI can help grid planners schedule investments in generation, energy storage, and other infrastructure that will be needed in the future. AI is also helping researchers discover or design novel materials for nuclear reactors, batteries, and electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are actively investigating aspects of those and other opportunities for AI to support the clean energy transition. At its 2025 research conference, MITEI announced the Data Center Power Forum,&amp;nbsp;a targeted research effort&amp;nbsp;for MITEI member companies interested in addressing the challenges of data center power demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling real-time operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers generally rely on receiving a continuous supply of electricity, and grid operators get help from AI to make that happen — while optimizing the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with more installation of solar and wind farms — both of which provide power in smaller amounts, and intermittently — and the growing threat of weather events and cyberattacks, ensuring reliability is getting more complicated. “That’s exactly where AI can come into the picture,” explains Anuradha Annaswamy, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. “Essentially, you need to introduce a whole information infrastructure to supplement and complement the physical infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electricity grid is a complex system that requires meticulous control on time scales ranging from decades all the way down to microseconds. The challenge can be traced to the basic laws of power physics: electricity supply must equal electricity demand at every instant, or generation can be interrupted. In past decades, grid operators generally assumed that generation was fixed — they could count on how much electricity each large power plant would produce — while demand varied over time in a fairly predictable way. As a result, operators could commission specific power plants to run as needed to meet demand the next day. If some outages occurred, specially designated units would start up as needed to make up the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today and in the future, that matching of supply and demand must still happen, even as the number of small, intermittent sources of generation grows and weather disturbances and other threats to the grid increase. AI algorithms provide a means of achieving the complex management of information needed to forecast within just a few hours which plants should run while also ensuring that the frequency, voltage, and other characteristics of the incoming power are as required for the grid to operate properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI can make possible new ways of increasing supply or decreasing demand at times when supplies on the grid run short. As Annaswamy points out, the battery in your electric vehicle (EV), as well as the one charged up by solar panels or wind turbines, can — when needed — serve as a source of extra power to be fed into the grid. And given real-time price signals, EV owners can choose to shift charging from a time when demand is peaking and prices are high to a time when demand and therefore prices are both lower. In addition, new smart thermostats can be set to allow the indoor temperature to drop or rise —&amp;nbsp; a range defined by the customer — when demand on the grid is peaking. And data centers themselves can be a source of demand flexibility: selected AI calculations could be delayed as needed to smooth out peaks in demand. Thus, AI can provide many opportunities to fine-tune both supply and demand as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI makes possible “predictive maintenance.” Any downtime is costly for the company and threatens shortages for the customers served. AI algorithms can collect key performance data during normal operation and, when readings veer off from that normal, the system can alert operators that something might be going wrong, giving them a chance to intervene. That capability prevents equipment failures, reduces the need for routine inspections, increases worker productivity, and extends the lifetime of key equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaswamy stresses that&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;“figuring out how to architect this new power grid with these AI components will require many different experts to come together.” She notes that electrical engineers, computer scientists, and energy economists “will have to rub shoulders with enlightened regulators and policymakers to make sure that this is not just an academic exercise, but will actually get implemented. All the different stakeholders have to learn from each other. And you need guarantees that nothing is going to fail. You can’t have blackouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI to help plan investments in infrastructure for the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid companies constantly need to plan for expanding generation, transmission, storage, and more, and getting all the necessary infrastructure built and operating may take many years, in some cases more than a decade. So, they need to predict what infrastructure they’ll need to ensure reliability in the future. “It’s complicated because you have to forecast over a decade ahead of time what to build and where to build it,” says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in MITEI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge with anticipating what will be needed is predicting how the future system will operate. “That’s becoming increasingly difficult,” says Deka, because more renewables are coming online and displacing traditional generators. In the past, operators could rely on “spinning reserves,” that is, generating capacity that’s not currently in use but could come online in a matter of minutes to meet any shortfall on the system. The presence of so many intermittent generators — wind and solar — means there’s now less stability and inertia built into the grid. Adding to the complication is that those intermittent generators can be built by various vendors, and grid planners may not have access to the physics-based equations that govern the operation of each piece of equipment at sufficiently fine time scales. “So, you probably don’t know exactly how it’s going to run,” says Deka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the weather. Determining the reliability of a proposed future energy system requires knowing what it’ll be up against in terms of weather&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The future grid has to be reliable not only in everyday weather, but also during low-probability but high-risk events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, all of which are becoming more and more frequent, notes Deka. AI can help by predicting such events and even tracking changes in weather patterns due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka points out another, less-obvious benefit of the speed of AI analysis. Any infrastructure development plan must be reviewed and approved, often by several regulatory and other bodies. Traditionally, an applicant would develop a plan, analyze its impacts, and submit the plan to one set of reviewers. After making any requested changes and repeating the analysis, the applicant would resubmit a revised version to the reviewers to see if the new version was acceptable. AI tools can speed up the required analysis so the process moves along more quickly. Planners can even reduce the number of times a proposal is rejected by using large language models to search regulatory publications and summarize what’s important for a proposed infrastructure installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing AI to discover and exploit advanced materials needed for the energy transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Use of AI for materials development is booming right now,” says Ju Li, MIT’s Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. He notes two main directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, AI makes possible faster physics-based simulations at the atomic scale. The result is a better atomic-level understanding of how composition, processing, structure, and chemical reactivity relate to the performance of materials. That understanding provides design rules to help guide the development and discovery of novel materials for energy generation, storage, and conversion needed for a sustainable future energy system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, AI can help guide experiments in real time as they take place in the lab. Li explains: “AI assists us in choosing the best experiment to do based on our previous experiments and — based on literature searches — makes hypotheses and suggests new experiments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He describes what happens in his own lab. Human scientists interact with a large language model, which then makes suggestions about what specific experiments to do next. The human researcher accepts or modifies the suggestion, and a robotic arm responds by setting up and performing the next step in the experimental sequence, synthesizing the material, testing the performance, and taking images of samples when appropriate. Based on a mix of literature knowledge, human intuition, and previous experimental results, AI thus coordinates active learning that balances the goals of reducing uncertainty with improving performance. And, as Li points out, “AI has read many more books and papers than any human can, and is thus naturally more interdisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome, says Li, is both better design of experiments and speeding up the “work flow.” Traditionally, the process of developing new materials has required synthesizing the precursors, making the material, testing its performance and characterizing the structure, making adjustments, and repeating the same series of steps. AI guidance speeds up that process, “helping us to design critical, cheap experiments that can give us the maximum amount of information feedback,” says Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having this capability certainly will accelerate material discovery, and this may be the thing that can really help us in the clean energy transition,” he concludes.&amp;nbsp;“AI [has the potential to] lubricate the material-discovery and optimization process, perhaps shortening it from decades, as in the past, to just a few years.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITEI’s contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, researchers are working on various aspects of the opportunities described above. In projects supported by MITEI, teams are using AI to better model and predict disruptions in plasma flows inside fusion reactors — a necessity in achieving practical fusion power generation. Other MITEI-supported teams are using AI-powered tools to interpret regulations, climate data, and infrastructure maps in order to achieve faster, more adaptive electric grid planning. AI-guided development of advanced materials continues, with one MITEI project using AI to optimize solar cells and thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other MITEI researchers are developing robots that can learn maintenance tasks based on human feedback, including physical intervention and verbal instructions. The goal is to reduce costs, improve safety, and accelerate the deployment of the renewable energy infrastructure. And MITEI-funded work continues on ways to reduce the energy demand of data centers, from designing more efficient computer chips and computing algorithms to rethinking the architectural design of the buildings, for example, to increase airflow so as to reduce the need for air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing leadership and funding for many research projects, MITEI acts as a convenor, bringing together interested parties to consider common problems and potential solutions. In May 2025, MITEI’s annual spring symposium — titled “AI and energy: Peril and promise” — brought together AI and energy experts from across academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations to explore AI as both a problem and a potential solution for the clean energy transition. At the close of the symposium, William H. Green, director of MITEI and Hoyt C. Hottel Professor in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering, noted, “The challenge of meeting data center energy demand and of unlocking the potential benefits of AI to the energy transition is now a research priority for MITEI.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There is growing attention on the links between artificial intelligence and increased energy demands. But while the power-hungry data centers being built to support AI could potentially stress electricity grids, increase customer prices and service interruptions, and generally slow the transition to clean energy, the use of artificial intelligence can also help the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, use of AI is reducing energy consumption and associated emissions in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes. In addition, AI is helping to optimize the design and siting of new wind and solar installations and energy storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On electric power grids, using AI algorithms to control operations is helping to increase efficiency and reduce costs, integrate the growing share of renewables, and even predict when key equipment needs servicing to prevent failure and possible blackouts. AI can help grid planners schedule investments in generation, energy storage, and other infrastructure that will be needed in the future. AI is also helping researchers discover or design novel materials for nuclear reactors, batteries, and electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are actively investigating aspects of those and other opportunities for AI to support the clean energy transition. At its 2025 research conference, MITEI announced the Data Center Power Forum,&amp;nbsp;a targeted research effort&amp;nbsp;for MITEI member companies interested in addressing the challenges of data center power demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling real-time operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers generally rely on receiving a continuous supply of electricity, and grid operators get help from AI to make that happen — while optimizing the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with more installation of solar and wind farms — both of which provide power in smaller amounts, and intermittently — and the growing threat of weather events and cyberattacks, ensuring reliability is getting more complicated. “That’s exactly where AI can come into the picture,” explains Anuradha Annaswamy, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. “Essentially, you need to introduce a whole information infrastructure to supplement and complement the physical infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electricity grid is a complex system that requires meticulous control on time scales ranging from decades all the way down to microseconds. The challenge can be traced to the basic laws of power physics: electricity supply must equal electricity demand at every instant, or generation can be interrupted. In past decades, grid operators generally assumed that generation was fixed — they could count on how much electricity each large power plant would produce — while demand varied over time in a fairly predictable way. As a result, operators could commission specific power plants to run as needed to meet demand the next day. If some outages occurred, specially designated units would start up as needed to make up the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today and in the future, that matching of supply and demand must still happen, even as the number of small, intermittent sources of generation grows and weather disturbances and other threats to the grid increase. AI algorithms provide a means of achieving the complex management of information needed to forecast within just a few hours which plants should run while also ensuring that the frequency, voltage, and other characteristics of the incoming power are as required for the grid to operate properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI can make possible new ways of increasing supply or decreasing demand at times when supplies on the grid run short. As Annaswamy points out, the battery in your electric vehicle (EV), as well as the one charged up by solar panels or wind turbines, can — when needed — serve as a source of extra power to be fed into the grid. And given real-time price signals, EV owners can choose to shift charging from a time when demand is peaking and prices are high to a time when demand and therefore prices are both lower. In addition, new smart thermostats can be set to allow the indoor temperature to drop or rise —&amp;nbsp; a range defined by the customer — when demand on the grid is peaking. And data centers themselves can be a source of demand flexibility: selected AI calculations could be delayed as needed to smooth out peaks in demand. Thus, AI can provide many opportunities to fine-tune both supply and demand as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI makes possible “predictive maintenance.” Any downtime is costly for the company and threatens shortages for the customers served. AI algorithms can collect key performance data during normal operation and, when readings veer off from that normal, the system can alert operators that something might be going wrong, giving them a chance to intervene. That capability prevents equipment failures, reduces the need for routine inspections, increases worker productivity, and extends the lifetime of key equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaswamy stresses that&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;“figuring out how to architect this new power grid with these AI components will require many different experts to come together.” She notes that electrical engineers, computer scientists, and energy economists “will have to rub shoulders with enlightened regulators and policymakers to make sure that this is not just an academic exercise, but will actually get implemented. All the different stakeholders have to learn from each other. And you need guarantees that nothing is going to fail. You can’t have blackouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI to help plan investments in infrastructure for the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grid companies constantly need to plan for expanding generation, transmission, storage, and more, and getting all the necessary infrastructure built and operating may take many years, in some cases more than a decade. So, they need to predict what infrastructure they’ll need to ensure reliability in the future. “It’s complicated because you have to forecast over a decade ahead of time what to build and where to build it,” says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in MITEI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge with anticipating what will be needed is predicting how the future system will operate. “That’s becoming increasingly difficult,” says Deka, because more renewables are coming online and displacing traditional generators. In the past, operators could rely on “spinning reserves,” that is, generating capacity that’s not currently in use but could come online in a matter of minutes to meet any shortfall on the system. The presence of so many intermittent generators — wind and solar — means there’s now less stability and inertia built into the grid. Adding to the complication is that those intermittent generators can be built by various vendors, and grid planners may not have access to the physics-based equations that govern the operation of each piece of equipment at sufficiently fine time scales. “So, you probably don’t know exactly how it’s going to run,” says Deka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the weather. Determining the reliability of a proposed future energy system requires knowing what it’ll be up against in terms of weather&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The future grid has to be reliable not only in everyday weather, but also during low-probability but high-risk events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, all of which are becoming more and more frequent, notes Deka. AI can help by predicting such events and even tracking changes in weather patterns due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka points out another, less-obvious benefit of the speed of AI analysis. Any infrastructure development plan must be reviewed and approved, often by several regulatory and other bodies. Traditionally, an applicant would develop a plan, analyze its impacts, and submit the plan to one set of reviewers. After making any requested changes and repeating the analysis, the applicant would resubmit a revised version to the reviewers to see if the new version was acceptable. AI tools can speed up the required analysis so the process moves along more quickly. Planners can even reduce the number of times a proposal is rejected by using large language models to search regulatory publications and summarize what’s important for a proposed infrastructure installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing AI to discover and exploit advanced materials needed for the energy transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Use of AI for materials development is booming right now,” says Ju Li, MIT’s Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. He notes two main directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, AI makes possible faster physics-based simulations at the atomic scale. The result is a better atomic-level understanding of how composition, processing, structure, and chemical reactivity relate to the performance of materials. That understanding provides design rules to help guide the development and discovery of novel materials for energy generation, storage, and conversion needed for a sustainable future energy system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, AI can help guide experiments in real time as they take place in the lab. Li explains: “AI assists us in choosing the best experiment to do based on our previous experiments and — based on literature searches — makes hypotheses and suggests new experiments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He describes what happens in his own lab. Human scientists interact with a large language model, which then makes suggestions about what specific experiments to do next. The human researcher accepts or modifies the suggestion, and a robotic arm responds by setting up and performing the next step in the experimental sequence, synthesizing the material, testing the performance, and taking images of samples when appropriate. Based on a mix of literature knowledge, human intuition, and previous experimental results, AI thus coordinates active learning that balances the goals of reducing uncertainty with improving performance. And, as Li points out, “AI has read many more books and papers than any human can, and is thus naturally more interdisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome, says Li, is both better design of experiments and speeding up the “work flow.” Traditionally, the process of developing new materials has required synthesizing the precursors, making the material, testing its performance and characterizing the structure, making adjustments, and repeating the same series of steps. AI guidance speeds up that process, “helping us to design critical, cheap experiments that can give us the maximum amount of information feedback,” says Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having this capability certainly will accelerate material discovery, and this may be the thing that can really help us in the clean energy transition,” he concludes.&amp;nbsp;“AI [has the potential to] lubricate the material-discovery and optimization process, perhaps shortening it from decades, as in the past, to just a few years.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITEI’s contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, researchers are working on various aspects of the opportunities described above. In projects supported by MITEI, teams are using AI to better model and predict disruptions in plasma flows inside fusion reactors — a necessity in achieving practical fusion power generation. Other MITEI-supported teams are using AI-powered tools to interpret regulations, climate data, and infrastructure maps in order to achieve faster, more adaptive electric grid planning. AI-guided development of advanced materials continues, with one MITEI project using AI to optimize solar cells and thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other MITEI researchers are developing robots that can learn maintenance tasks based on human feedback, including physical intervention and verbal instructions. The goal is to reduce costs, improve safety, and accelerate the deployment of the renewable energy infrastructure. And MITEI-funded work continues on ways to reduce the energy demand of data centers, from designing more efficient computer chips and computing algorithms to rethinking the architectural design of the buildings, for example, to increase airflow so as to reduce the need for air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing leadership and funding for many research projects, MITEI acts as a convenor, bringing together interested parties to consider common problems and potential solutions. In May 2025, MITEI’s annual spring symposium — titled “AI and energy: Peril and promise” — brought together AI and energy experts from across academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations to explore AI as both a problem and a potential solution for the clean energy transition.

The feature had a tenuous rollout — Martin Luther King Jr.’s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on — but now it faces a new challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The temporary restraining order issued on November 21, 2025 is set to expire on December 22, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at 11:00 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As of Monday afternoon, the Sora app still uses the “cameo” language, however. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt; “We are gratified by the court’s decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. “While the court’s order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI disagrees with the assertion that the company can claim exclusive ownership over the word “cameo,” the company told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s how OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes how he thinks people will respond to seeing the company’s forthcoming AI hardware device for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless” and pocket-sized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ive confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Anthropic today released Opus 4.5, its flagship frontier model, and it brings improvements in coding performance, as well as some user experience improvements that make it more generally competitive with OpenAI’s latest frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prominent change for most users is that in the consumer app experiences (web, mobile, and desktop), Claude will be less prone to abruptly hard-stopping conversations because they have run too long. The improvement to memory within a single conversation applies not just to Opus 4.5, but to any current Claude models in the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who experienced abrupt endings (despite having room left in their session and weekly usage budgets) were hitting a hard context window (200,000 tokens). Whereas some large language model implementations simply start trimming earlier messages from the context when a conversation runs past the maximum in the window, Claude simply ended the conversation rather than allow the user to experience an increasingly incoherent conversation where the model would&amp;nbsp;start forgetting things based on how old they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Claude will instead go through a behind-the-scenes process of summarizing the key points from the earlier parts of the conversation, attempting to discard what it deems extraneous while keeping what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers who call Anthropic’s API can leverage the same principles through context management and context compaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opus 4.5 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.5 is the first model to surpass an accuracy score of 80 percent—specifically, 80.9 percent in the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, narrowly beating OpenAI’s recently released GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (77.9 percent) and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro (76.2 percent). The model performs particularly well in agentic coding and agentic tool use benchmarks, but still lags behind GPT-5.1 in visual reasoning (MMMU).&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic also claims that Opus 4.5 is far less susceptible to prompt injection attacks than prior Claude models, or than competing models like GPT-5.1 and Gemini 3 Pro. Still, none of these models has perfect performance on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the improvements to performance in benchmarks are worth noting, the most meaningful improvement in Opus 4.5 is arguably that it is significantly more efficient with tokens. Anthropic’s blog post offers examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5’s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points—while using 48% fewer tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Opus 4.5 launch is accompanied by other new features for developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the developer platform now includes a new “effort” parameter, allowing developers to more precisely tune the balance they want between efficacy and token usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Claude Code is now available in the desktop Claude apps. Previously, it was available via command line, IDE extensions, the web—a few places, just not the native desktop apps. The Claude desktop interface is now tabbed between the traditional chat experience and the Claude Code experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly (and for some, most importantly), there’s a big pricing change for the API for Opus 4.5. The cost is now $5 (input)/$25 (output) per million tokens, down from $15/$75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel’s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. “This is the Futures Fund’s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country’s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The partnership follows Google’s recent $15 billion plan to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India. The company also announced a $10 billion digitization fund in 2020, which has backed firms including Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Walmart-owned Flipkart. Last month, Google partnered with Reliance to offer millions of Jio users free access to AI Pro.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google launched the AI Futures Fund in May as a dedicated vehicle to invest in and collaborate with AI startups globally. It has backed companies including Replit and Harvey, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as Toonsutra and STAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Silber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be “a material presence,” but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,” Silber said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sometimes, Google’s technology is the best. Other times, you’ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we’re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google’s models,” said Silber. “What we’re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in 2021, Accel’s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm expanded the program this year to include Indian-origin founders based overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest collaboration comes days after Accel’s partnership with Prosus to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Silber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not a sales team, so we’re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That’s not our goal,” he said. “In terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-india.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google has partnered with Accel to find and fund India’s earliest-stage AI startups in a first-of-its-kind collaboration for the Google AI Futures Fund, launched earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel’s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;
