&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Less than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister told the Journal. TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had&amp;nbsp;“made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Ryan Beiermeister, who served as OpenAI’s vice president of product policy, was fired in January after a male colleague accused her of sex discrimination, the Wall Street Journal has reported.&lt;/p&gt;

Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2256968212.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting.

Announced today, the agreement is designed to break down data silos and accelerate the deployment of AI models from the data centre to the tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, it’s part of a broader move away from fragmented and project-specific AI pilots toward a more platform engineering approach. By standardising on Red Hat’s infrastructure, the MOD aims to decouple its AI capabilities from underlying hardware, allowing algorithms to be developed once and deployed anywhere—whether on-premise, in the cloud, or on disconnected field devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-hat-industrialises-the-ai-lifecycle-for-the-mod"&gt;Red Hat industrialises the AI lifecycle for the MOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement focuses on the Defence Digital Foundry, the MOD’s central software delivery hub. The Foundry will now provide a consistent MLOps environment to all service branches, including the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this initiative is Red Hat AI, a suite that includes Red Hat OpenShift AI. This platform addresses a familiar bottleneck in enterprise AI: the “inference gap” between data science teams and operational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agreement will allow MOD developers to collaborate on a single platform, choosing the most appropriate AI models and hardware accelerators for their specific mission requirements without being locked into a single vendor’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This standardisation is vital for “enabling AI at scale,” according to Red Hat. By unifying disparate efforts, the MOD intends to reduce the duplication that often plagues large government IT programs. The platform supports optimised inference, ensuring that AI models can run efficiently on restricted hardware footprints often found in military environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivy James, CTO at the UK MOD, said: “Easing access to Red Hat platforms becomes all the more important for the UK Ministry of Defence in the era of AI, where rapid adoption, replicating good practice, and the ability to scale are critical to strategic advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-legacy-and-autonomous-systems"&gt;Bridging legacy and autonomous systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major hurdle for defence modernisation is the coexistence of legacy virtualised workloads with modern, containerised AI applications. The agreement includes Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, which provides a “well-lit migration path” for existing systems. This allows the MOD to manage traditional virtual machines alongside new neural networks on the same control plane to reduce operational complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOD deal also incorporates Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to drive enterprise-wide AI automation. In an AI context, automation is the enforcement mechanism for governance.

Announced today, the agreement is designed to break down data silos and accelerate the deployment of AI models from the data centre to the tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, it’s part of a broader move away from fragmented and project-specific AI pilots toward a more platform engineering approach. By standardising on Red Hat’s infrastructure, the MOD aims to decouple its AI capabilities from underlying hardware, allowing algorithms to be developed once and deployed anywhere—whether on-premise, in the cloud, or on disconnected field devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-red-hat-industrialises-the-ai-lifecycle-for-the-mod"&gt;Red Hat industrialises the AI lifecycle for the MOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement focuses on the Defence Digital Foundry, the MOD’s central software delivery hub. The Foundry will now provide a consistent MLOps environment to all service branches, including the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this initiative is Red Hat AI, a suite that includes Red Hat OpenShift AI. This platform addresses a familiar bottleneck in enterprise AI: the “inference gap” between data science teams and operational infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agreement will allow MOD developers to collaborate on a single platform, choosing the most appropriate AI models and hardware accelerators for their specific mission requirements without being locked into a single vendor’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This standardisation is vital for “enabling AI at scale,” according to Red Hat. By unifying disparate efforts, the MOD intends to reduce the duplication that often plagues large government IT programs. The platform supports optimised inference, ensuring that AI models can run efficiently on restricted hardware footprints often found in military environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivy James, CTO at the UK MOD, said: “Easing access to Red Hat platforms becomes all the more important for the UK Ministry of Defence in the era of AI, where rapid adoption, replicating good practice, and the ability to scale are critical to strategic advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-legacy-and-autonomous-systems"&gt;Bridging legacy and autonomous systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major hurdle for defence modernisation is the coexistence of legacy virtualised workloads with modern, containerised AI applications. The agreement includes Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, which provides a “well-lit migration path” for existing systems. This allows the MOD to manage traditional virtual machines alongside new neural networks on the same control plane to reduce operational complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOD deal also incorporates Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to drive enterprise-wide AI automation. In an AI context, automation is the enforcement mechanism for governance. It ensures that as models are retrained and redeployed, the underlying configuration management, security orchestration, and service provisioning remain compliant with rigorous defence standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-and-ecosystem-alignment"&gt;Security and ecosystem alignment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying AI in defence naturally requires a “consistent security footprint” that can withstand sophisticated cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Hat platform enables DevSecOps practices, integrating security gates directly into the software supply chain.

Sedgwick, in collaboration with Microsoft, deployed the Sidekick Agent to assist claims professionals. The system improved claims processing efficiency by more than 30 percent through real-time guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational gains extend to customer support. Standard chatbots usually answer a query or transfer the user to a queue. An agentic solution manages the process from end-to-end.

Establishing an ‘AI Center of Excellence’ provides the governance and technical expertise needed to stop fragmented adoption. Teams should start with the high-volume and repeatable tasks to refine models through feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry accelerators can also speed up the process.

Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24304431552828.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected.

On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/11/1132714/evs-africa-cost/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Barclays bets on AI to cut costs and boost returns (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/barclays-bets-on-ai-to-cut-costs-and-boost-returns/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Barclays-bets-on-AI-to-cut-costs-and-boost-returns-scaled-e1770777477602.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays recorded a 12 % jump in annual profit for 2025, reporting £9.1 billion in earnings before tax, up from £8.1 billion a year earlier. The bank also raised its performance targets out through 2028, aiming for a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of more than 14 %, up from a previous goal of above 12 % by 2026. A growing US business and cost reductions underpinned this outcome, with Barclays citing AI as a key driver of those efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when many large companies are still experimenting with AI pilots, Barclays is tying the technology directly to its cost structure and profit outlook. In public statements and investor filings, leadership positions AI as one of the levers that can help the bank sustain lower costs and improved returns, especially as macroeconomic conditions shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays’ 12 % profit rise this week matters, not just for its shareholders, but because it reflects a trend that traditional, highly regulated firms are now positioning AI as a core part of running the business, not something kept in separate innovation labs. For companies outside tech, linking AI to measurable results such as profit and efficiency marks a shift toward operational use over hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-ai-matters-for-cost-discipline"&gt;Why AI matters for cost discipline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has said that technology such as AI is part of its plan to cut costs and make its operations more efficient. That includes trimming parts of the legacy technology stack and rethinking where and how work happens. Investment in AI tools complements broader cost savings goals that stretch back multiple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many large companies, labour and legacy systems still make up a large chunk of operating expenses. Using AI to automate repetitive tasks or streamline data processing can reduce that burden. In Barclays’ case, these efficiencies are part of the bank’s rationale for setting higher performance targets, even though margins remain under pressure in parts of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be specific about what these efficiencies mean in practice. AI technologies, for example, models that assist with risk analysis, customer service workflows, and internal reporting, can reduce the hours staff spend on manual work. That doesn’t always mean cutting jobs outright, but it can lower the overall cost base, especially in functions that are routine or transaction-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-investment-to-impact"&gt;From investment to impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments in AI don’t translate to results overnight. Barclays’ approach combines these tools with structural cost reduction programs, helping the bank manage expenses at a time when revenue growth alone isn’t enough to lift returns to desired levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays’ performance targets for 2028 reflect this dual focus. The bank’s leadership has said that its plans include returning more than £15 billion to shareholders between 2026 and 2028, supported by improved efficiency and profit strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, companies talk about technology investment in vague terms. Barclays’ latest figures make the link between tech and profit more concrete: the 12 % profit rise was reported in the same breath as the role of technology in trimming costs. It’s not the only factor; improved market conditions and growth in the US also helped, but it’s clearly part of the narrative that management is presenting to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on cost discipline and profit impact sets Barclays apart from firms that treat AI as a long-term bet or a future project. Here, AI is integrated into ongoing cost management and financial planning, giving the bank a plausible pathway to stronger returns in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-legacy-firms"&gt;What this means for legacy firms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is far from unique in exploring AI for cost savings and efficiency. Other banks have also flagged technology investments as part of broader restructuring efforts. But what makes Barclays’ case noteworthy is the scale of the strategy and the way it is tied to measured performance targets, not just experimentation or small-scale pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional industries, especially ones as regulated as banking, adopting AI is harder than in tech startups. Firms must navigate compliance, risk, customer privacy, and legacy systems that weren’t designed for automation. Yet Barclays’ public comments suggest that the bank is now comfortable enough with these tools to anchor part of its financial forecast on them. That signals a degree of maturity in how the institution operationalises AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays isn’t simply building isolated AI projects; leadership is weaving technology into cost discipline, modernisation of systems, and long-term planning. That shift matters because it shows how legacy firms, even those with large, complex operations, can start to move beyond pilots and into business-wide use cases that affect the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other end-user companies evaluating AI investments, Barclays offers a working example: a large, regulated company can use technology to help hit cost and profitability targets, not just to explore new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Jose Marroquin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Goldman Sachs tests autonomous AI agents for process-heavy work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

            &lt;p&gt;James J. Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science at MIT and faculty co-lead of the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, is embarking on a multidisciplinary research project that applies synthetic biology and generative artificial intelligence to the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research project is sponsored by Jameel Research, part of the Abdul Latif Jameel International network. The initial three-year, $3 million research project in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute of Medical Engineering and Science focuses on developing and validating programmable antibacterials against key pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMR — driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics — has accelerated the rise of drug-resistant infections, while the development of new antibacterial tools has slowed. The impact is felt worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where limited diagnostic infrastructure causes delays or ineffective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project centers on developing a new generation of targeted antibacterials using AI to design small proteins to disable specific bacterial functions. These designer molecules would be produced and delivered by engineered microbes, providing a more precise and adaptable approach than traditional antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project reflects my belief that tackling AMR requires both bold scientific ideas and a pathway to real-world impact,” Collins says. “Jameel Research is keen to address this crisis by supporting innovative, translatable research at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, chair of Abdul Latif Jameel, says, “antimicrobial resistance is one of the most urgent challenges we face today, and addressing it will require ambitious science and sustained collaboration.
