&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Citing a PowerPoint presentation dated July 1, The Post reports that the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool is supposed to analyze around 200,000 federal regulations and identify the ones that are no longer required by law, with the goal of eliminating half those regulations by the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s return to office.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It seems this work is already underway, with the presentation declaring the tool has already been used to review regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to write “100% of deregulations” Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A White House spokesperson told The Post that “no single plan has been approved or greenlit” but praised the DOGE team as “the best and brightest in the business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is just the latest AI tool developed by DOGE (led in the early months of the Trump administration by Elon Musk), including one reportedly error-prone tool that would hallucinate the size of Veterans Affairs contracts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200924488.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Department of Government Efficiency hopes to use a new AI tool to eliminate half of the federal government’s regulatory mandates, according to The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;
