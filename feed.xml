Hello personal conglomerates. (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/bye-bye-corporate-conglomerates-hello-personal-conglomerates/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147789843.jpg?resize=1200,737" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Aerospace, energy, healthcare, mobility, and media. Thirty years ago, we’d be talking about General Electric. Today, we’re talking about Elon Musk. He’s the CEO of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX, which also owns the telecoms company Starlink. He owns the social media platform X. He’s developing neural implants and underground tunnels. He’s put at least $10 million behind fertility research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk also appears to be merging several of these ventures into one conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk has frequently been likened to Henry Ford. A more apt comparison might be to John D. Rockefeller or Jack Welch, who took GE from an ailing industrial company into a sprawling conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Welch comparison could turn out to be particularly valid if Musk follows through on rumors that he’s trying to merge some combination of SpaceX, xAI and Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The similarities aren’t all encompassing, of course. GE was a company, and Musk is a person. But the distinction can get a bit blurry in an era when his net worth eclipses the market cap of 97% of the S&amp;amp;P 500. In fact, Musk’s net worth is approaching $800 billion, almost as much as GE at its peak when adjusted for inflation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its height, GE was often inseparable from its chairman, Jack Welch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk, the individual, captivates many of his peers, just like Welch did. Executives today talk of being “hardcore” and espouse “first-principles thinking,” just like CEOs of the 1980s sought to emulate Welch through “accretive” mergers and mass layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Musk’s empire spans Tesla, SpaceX, xAI (including with X), Neuralink, and The Boring Company, all companies with very different goals. Sure, Teslas drive through The Boring Company’s holes, xAI’s Grok is available in the automaker’s vehicles, and Tesla has supplied its Megapack batteries to xAI’s data centers. But apart from sharing Musk’s ownership or leadership, they’ve had limited interaction with each other until recently, when Tesla and SpaceX separately invested in xAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-everything-company"&gt;The everything company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At one time, not so long ago, GE was the world’s most valuable company, with divisions that made light bulbs, jet engines, home appliances, X-ray and ultrasound machines, steam turbines, locomotives, and television shows, among dozens of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Welch took the helm of GE in 1981, he inherited a company adrift, having lost a fifth of its market cap in the preceding decade. His first move was to trim headcount. In fact, he laid off so many employees — more than 100,000 in his first few years — that he became known as “Neutron Jack,” an allusion to the neutron bomb, which eliminates people while leaving buildings intact.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the savings, Welch went out and acquired company after company. Many of them manufactured stuff, similar to GE’s existing businesses. But some, like NBC, which Welch bought in 1986, did not. That one was added to the portfolio to expand the company’s influence. (Sound familiar?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During his tenure as chairman of GE, Welch was revered for his management abilities, with rival CEOs emulating his management style. The company’s management training program was put on the same pedestal as top business schools, and several of his proteges went on to run Fortune 500 companies themselves. Through a relentless series of layoffs and acquisitions, Welch had turned GE into a money printing machine. The company grew from $14 billion when he took over to over $400 billion when he left in 2001. Shareholder dividends only went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Welch’s approach wasn’t ironclad. In 2001, his last year at GE, the company’s share price declined. By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, it was clear that the company’s conglomerate structure was hiding some grievous flaws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Profits from GE Capital were used to paper over poor performance in other divisions. When it became clear that GE Capital was deep into questionable financial instruments, fractures in the business model widened. GE Capital was ultimately bailed out by the federal government to the tune of $139 billion, but the shine was off. Five years ago, GE announced that it would split itself into three separate companies. The conglomerate was no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from Welch, Musk might have another comparison a bit farther back in history, before GE became the prototypical conglomerate. “I think it’s much more of a robber baron story than a GE conglomerate story,” David Yoffie, professor at Harvard Business School, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gilded-age-ceo"&gt;Gilded Age CEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the Gilded Age, he said, people like J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller controlled large, powerful companies that built new industries like railroads and oil companies. They controlled those firms either directly or through board seats they influenced, and they could mix and match companies as they pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think that’s much more the type of approach that Elon is taking,” Yoffie said. “It’s much more about ego, market power, and trying to be the kingmaker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much of the robber barons’ power came from two sources: their tremendous wealth and the lack of regulation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wealth disparities have grown similarly large in recent years. John D. Rockefeller’s wealth was equal to a percentage point or two of the United States’ total GDP, about the same as Musk’s today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s different, of course, is that there was no regulatory framework whatsoever during the period of the Gilded Age,” Yoffie said. “Today, we obviously live in a much more heavily regulated world, but we’re also at the moment living in a world in which regulation is getting pulled back and therefore is less and less of a constraint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What ultimately happens to Musk and his empire will depend both on the direction he decides to take things — to merge his companies or keep them separate — and how society responds to his growing power. Musk, like his Gilded Age predecessors, has been attempting to put his thumb on the scales, spending more than $300 million trying to influence elections in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Musk ends up merging one or more of his companies, he’ll end up with a true conglomerate, something that’s not in vogue today. Conglomerates in the U.S. emerged as a way for investors to hedge risk by buying shares in one company that has businesses that are counter-cyclical, Yoffie said. If one division hits a rough patch, others can pick up the slack to keep revenue and profit smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Most of that strategy and approach was debunked in subsequent decades,” he said. Investors tend to do better when they buy shares in more specialized companies, which are able to operate more efficiently. Conglomerates also make it difficult to disentangle the different businesses to accurately determine their value. “It’s well known in finance that there’s a conglomerate discount,” Yoffie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Merger talk aside, the biggest constraint on Musk’s companies might be regulation, which is ultimately driven by public opinion. The tycoons of the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries found their power ultimately checked by a wave of new regulations introduced in the Progressive Era. Musk has a knack for embracing visions of the future that captivate people’s imaginations and translating them into business plans. The question is, how long will he be able to keep it up?&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147789843.jpg?resize=1200,737" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Aerospace, energy, healthcare, mobility, and media.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Sunday, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced (PDF) the proposal in the country’s annual budget, offering a tax holiday — effectively zero taxes — on revenues from cloud services sold outside India if those services are run from data centers in the country. Sales to Indian customers would have to be routed through locally incorporated resellers and taxed domestically, she told parliament. The budget also proposes a 15% cost-plus safe harbour for Indian data-center operators providing services to related foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes as U.S. cloud giants including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to add data-center capacity worldwide to support the surge in artificial-intelligence workloads, with India emerging as an increasingly attractive location for new investment. The country offers a large pool of engineering talent and growing demand for cloud services, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia for expanding compute infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October, Google said it would invest $15 billion to build an AI hub and expand data-center infrastructure in India, its largest commitment in the country to date, following a $10 billion commitment in 2020. Microsoft followed in December with plans to invest $17.5 billion by 2029 to expand its AI and cloud footprint, funding new data centers, infrastructure, and training programs. Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would invest $11 billion by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to invest up to $5 billion alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose key constraints for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have sought clarity from New Delhi on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India grapples with tightening global supplies of rare earth materials used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a seven-year incentive program approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Overall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/india-flag.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As the global race to build AI infrastructure accelerates, India has offered foreign cloud providers zero taxes through 2047 on services sold outside the country if they run those workloads from Indian data centers — a bid to attract the next wave of AI computing investment, even as power shortages and water stress threaten expansion in the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes as U.S. cloud giants including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to add data-center capacity worldwide to support the surge in artificial-intelligence workloads, with India emerging as an increasingly attractive location for new investment. The country offers a large pool of engineering talent and growing demand for cloud services, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia for expanding compute infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October, Google said it would invest $15 billion to build an AI hub and expand data-center infrastructure in India, its largest commitment in the country to date, following a $10 billion commitment in 2020. Microsoft followed in December with plans to invest $17.5 billion by 2029 to expand its AI and cloud footprint, funding new data centers, infrastructure, and training programs. Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would invest $11 billion by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to invest up to $5 billion alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose key constraints for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have sought clarity from New Delhi on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India grapples with tightening global supplies of rare earth materials used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a seven-year incentive program approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Overall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/india-offers-zero-taxes-through-2047-to-lure-global-ai-workloads/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Indonesia ‘conditionally’ lifts ban on Grok (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/indonesia-conditionally-lifts-ban-on-grok/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207699717.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Indonesia has followed Malaysia and the Philippines in lifting a ban on xAI’s chatbot Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Southeast Asian countries banned Grok after it was used to create a flood of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery on X (now a subsidiary of xAI), including images of real women and minors. In late December and January, Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation via The New York Times).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office was investigating xAI and had sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the company to take immediate action to end the production of these images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;xAI appears to have taken some steps to restrict Grok’s capabilities, including limiting its AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on X. CEO Elon Musk has insisted, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” and said he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.”&lt;/p&gt;
