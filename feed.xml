Instead, Suleyman wrote today in a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/10/23/human-centered-ai/"&gt;blog post:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“At the foundation of it all is our strategy to put the best models to work for you – both those we build and those we don’t. Over the past few months, we have released in-house models like MAI-Voice-1, MAI-1-Preview and MAI-Vision-1, and are rapidly iterating.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 Features That Redefine Copilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fall Release consolidates Copilot’s identity around twelve key capabilities—each with potential to streamline organizational knowledge work, development, or support operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Groups&lt;/b&gt; – Shared Copilot sessions where up to 32 participants can brainstorm, co-author, or plan simultaneously. For distributed teams, it effectively merges a meeting chat, task board, and generative workspace. Copilot maintains context, summarizes decisions, and tracks open actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Imagine&lt;/b&gt; – A collaborative hub for creating and remixing AI-generated content. In an enterprise setting, Imagine enables rapid prototyping of visuals, marketing drafts, or training materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mico&lt;/b&gt; – A new character identity for Copilot that introduces expressive feedback and emotional expression in the form of a cute, amorphous blob. Echoing Microsoft’s historic character interfaces like &lt;b&gt;Clippy&lt;/b&gt; (Office 97) or &lt;b&gt;Cortana&lt;/b&gt; (2014), Mico serves as a unifying UX layer across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Talk&lt;/b&gt; – A conversational mode that adapts to a user’s communication style and offers calibrated pushback — ending the sycophancy that some users have complained about with other AI models such as &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-rolls-back-chatgpts-sycophancy-and-explains-what-went-wrong"&gt;prior versions of OpenAI&amp;#x27;s ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. For professionals, it allows Socratic problem-solving rather than passive answer generation, making Copilot more credible in technical collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory &amp;amp; Personalization&lt;/b&gt; – Long-term contextual memory that lets Copilot recall key details—training plans, dates, goals—at the user’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connectors&lt;/b&gt; – Integration with OneDrive, Outlook, Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar for natural-language search across accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive Actions (Preview)&lt;/b&gt; – Context-based prompts and next-step suggestions derived from recent activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot for Health&lt;/b&gt; – Health information grounded in credible medical sources such as Harvard Health, with tools allowing users to locate and compare doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn Live&lt;/b&gt; – A Socratic, voice-driven tutoring experience using questions, visuals, and whiteboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot Mode in Edge&lt;/b&gt; – Converts Microsoft Edge into an “AI browser” that summarizes, compares, and executes web actions by voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot on Windows&lt;/b&gt; – Deep integration across Windows 11 PCs with “Hey Copilot” activation, Copilot Vision guidance, and quick access to files and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot Pages and Copilot Search&lt;/b&gt; – A collaborative file canvas plus a unified search experience combining AI-generated, cited answers with standard web results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fall Release is immediately available in the United States, with rollout to the UK, Canada, and other markets in progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some functions—such as Groups, Journeys, and Copilot for Health—remain U.S.-only for now. Proactive Actions requires a Microsoft 365 Personal, Family, or Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together these updates illustrate Microsoft’s pivot from static productivity suites to contextual AI infrastructure, with the Copilot brand acting as the connective tissue across user roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Clippy to Mico: The Return of a Guided Interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable introductions is Mico, a small animated companion that is available within Copilot’s voice-enabled experiences, including the Copilot app on Windows, iOS, and Android, as well as in Study Mode and other conversational contexts. It serves as an optional visual companion that appears during interactive or voice-based sessions, rather than across all Copilot interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mico listens, reacts with expressions, and changes color to reflect tone and emotion — bringing a visual warmth to an AI assistant experience that has traditionally been text-heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mico’s design recalls earlier eras of Microsoft’s history with character-based assistants. In the mid-1990s, Microsoft experimented with Microsoft Bob (1995), a software interface that used cartoon characters like a dog named Rover to guide users through everyday computing tasks. While innovative for its time, Bob was discontinued after a year due to performance and usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later came Clippy, the Office Assistant introduced in Microsoft Office 97. Officially known as “Clippit,” the animated paperclip would pop up to offer help and tips within Word and other Office applications. Clippy became widely recognized—sometimes humorously so—for interrupting users with unsolicited advice. Microsoft retired Clippy from Office in 2001, though the character remains a nostalgic symbol of early AI-driven assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Cortana, launched in 2014 as Microsoft’s digital voice assistant for Windows and mobile devices, aimed to provide natural-language interaction similar to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. Despite positive early reception, Cortana’s role diminished as Microsoft refocused on enterprise productivity and AI integration. The service was officially discontinued on Windows in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mico, by contrast, represents a modern reimagining of that tradition—combining the personality of early assistants with the intelligence and adaptability of contemporary AI models. Where Clippy offered canned responses, Mico listens, learns, and reflects a user’s mood in real time. The goal, as Suleyman framed it, is to create an AI that feels “helpful, supportive, and deeply personal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Groups Are Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Version of Claude and ChatGPT Projects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Microsoft’s launch video, product researcher Wendy described Groups as a transformative shift: “You can finally bring in other people directly to the conversation that you’re having with Copilot,” she said. “It’s the only place you can do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 32 users can join a shared Copilot session, brainstorming, editing, or planning together while the AI manages logistics such as summarizing discussion threads, tallying votes, and splitting tasks. Participants can enter or exit sessions using a link, maintaining full visibility into ongoing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a single user prompting an AI and later sharing results, Groups lets teams prompt and iterate together in one unified conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it&amp;#x27;s an answer to Anthropic’s Claude Projects and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Projects, both launched within the last year as tools to centralize team workspaces and shared AI context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Claude and ChatGPT Projects allow users to aggregate files, prompts, and conversations into a single container, Groups extends that model into real-time, multi-participant collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s implementations, Groups is deeply embedded within Microsoft’s productivity environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Copilot experiences connected to Outlook and OneDrive, Groups operates within Microsoft’s enterprise identity framework, governed by Microsoft 365 and Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) authentication and consent models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means conversations, shared artifacts, and generated summaries are governed under the same compliance policies that already protect Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after the unveiling, OpenAI hit back against its own investor in the escalating AI competition between the &amp;quot;frenemies&amp;quot; by expanding its Shared Projects feature beyond its current Enterprise, Team, and Edu subscriber availability to &lt;a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1981432799212249119"&gt;users of its free, Plus, and Pro subscription tiers. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational Impact for AI and Data Teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory &amp;amp; Personalization and Connectors effectively extend a lightweight orchestration layer across Microsoft’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of building separate context-stores or retrieval APIs, teams can leverage Copilot’s secure integration with OneDrive or SharePoint as a governed data backbone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presenter explained that Copilot’s memory “naturally picks up on important details and remembers them long after you’ve had the conversation,” yet remains editable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data engineers, Copilot Search and Connectors reduce friction in data discovery across multiple systems. Natural-language retrieval from internal and cloud repositories may lower the cost of knowledge management initiatives by consolidating search endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security directors, Copilot’s explicit consent requirements and on/off toggles in Edge and Windows help maintain data residency standards. The company reiterated during the livestream that Copilot “acts only with user permission and within organizational privacy controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot Mode in Edge: The AI Browser for Research and Automation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot Mode in Edge stands out for offering AI-assisted information workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser can now parse open tabs, summarize differences, and perform transactional steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, browsers have been static—just endless clicking and tab-hopping,” said a presenter during Microsoft’s livestream. “We asked not how browsers should work, but how people work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, an analyst could prompt Edge to compare supplier documentation, extract structured data, and auto-fill procurement forms—all with consistent citation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice-only navigation enables accessibility and multitasking, while Journeys, a companion feature, organizes browsing sessions into storylines for later review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot on Windows: The Operating System as an AI Surface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Windows 11, Copilot now functions as an embedded assistant. With the wake-word “Hey Copilot,” users can initiate context-aware commands without leaving the desktop—drafting documentation, troubleshooting configuration issues, or summarizing system logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presenter described it as a “super assistant plugged into all your files and applications.” For enterprises standardizing on Windows 11, this positions Copilot as a native productivity layer rather than an add-on, reducing training friction and promoting secure, on-device reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot Vision, now in early deployment, adds visual comprehension. IT staff can capture a screen region and ask Copilot to interpret error messages, explain configuration options, or generate support tickets automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with Copilot Pages, which supports up to twenty concurrent file uploads, this enables more efficient cross-document analysis for audits, RFPs, or code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leveraging MAI Models for Multimodal Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the foundation of these capabilities are Microsoft’s proprietary &lt;b&gt;MAI-Voice-1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;MAI-1 Preview&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;MAI-Vision-1&lt;/b&gt; models—trained in-house to handle text, voice, and visual inputs cohesively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For engineering teams managing LLM orchestration, this architecture introduces several potential efficiencies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unified multimodal reasoning&lt;/b&gt; – Reduces the need for separate ASR (speech-to-text) and image-parsing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fine-tuning continuity&lt;/b&gt; – Because Microsoft owns the model stack, updates propagate across Copilot experiences without re-integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predictable latency and governance&lt;/b&gt; – In-house hosting under Azure compliance frameworks simplifies security certification for regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presenter described the new stack as “the foundation for immersive, creative, and dynamic experiences that still respect enterprise boundaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Strategic Pivot Toward Contextual AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Microsoft positioned Copilot primarily as a productivity companion. With the Fall 2025 release, it crosses into operational AI infrastructure—a set of extensible services for reasoning over data and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman described this evolution succinctly: “Judge an AI by how much it elevates human potential, not just by its own smarts.” For CIOs and technical leads, the elevation comes from efficiency and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot now acts as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A connective interface linking files, communications, and cloud data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasoning agent capable of understanding context across sessions and modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secure orchestration layer compatible with Microsoft’s compliance and identity framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman’s insistence that “technology should work in service of people” now extends to organizations as well: technology that serves teams, not workloads; systems that adapt to enterprise context rather than demand it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today held a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/j4jXM8yTdnQ?si=6nQuwRzBk6luy2fd"&gt;live announcement event online &lt;/a&gt;for its Copilot AI digital assistant, with &lt;b&gt;Mustafa Suleyman&lt;/b&gt;, CEO of Microsoft&amp;#x27;s AI division, and other presenters unveiling a new generation of features that deepen integration across Windows, Edge, and Microsoft 365, positioning the platform as a practical assistant for people during work and off-time, while allowing them  to preserve control and safety of their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;b&gt;Copilot 2025 Fall Update features&lt;/b&gt; also up the ante in terms of capabilities and the accessibility of generative AI assistance from Microsoft to users, so businesses relying on Microsoft products, and those who seek to offer complimentary or competing products, would do well to review them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman emphasized that the updates reflect a shift from hype to usefulness. “Technology should work in service of people, not the other way around,” he said. “Copilot is not just a product—it’s a promise that AI can be helpful, supportive, and deeply personal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the announcement also sought to shine a greater spotlight on Microsoft&amp;#x27;s own homegrown AI models, as opposed to those of its partner and investment OpenAI, which previously powered the entire Copilot experience.

The company reiterated during the livestream that Copilot “acts only with user permission and within organizational privacy controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot Mode in Edge: The AI Browser for Research and Automation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot Mode in Edge stands out for offering AI-assisted information workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The browser can now parse open tabs, summarize differences, and perform transactional steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, browsers have been static—just endless clicking and tab-hopping,” said a presenter during Microsoft’s livestream. “We asked not how browsers should work, but how people work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, an analyst could prompt Edge to compare supplier documentation, extract structured data, and auto-fill procurement forms—all with consistent citation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice-only navigation enables accessibility and multitasking, while Journeys, a companion feature, organizes browsing sessions into storylines for later review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copilot on Windows: The Operating System as an AI Surface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Windows 11, Copilot now functions as an embedded assistant. With the wake-word “Hey Copilot,” users can initiate context-aware commands without leaving the desktop—drafting documentation, troubleshooting configuration issues, or summarizing system logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presenter described it as a “super assistant plugged into all your files and applications.” For enterprises standardizing on Windows 11, this positions Copilot as a native productivity layer rather than an add-on, reducing training friction and promoting secure, on-device reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot Vision, now in early deployment, adds visual comprehension. IT staff can capture a screen region and ask Copilot to interpret error messages, explain configuration options, or generate support tickets automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with Copilot Pages, which supports up to twenty concurrent file uploads, this enables more efficient cross-document analysis for audits, RFPs, or code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leveraging MAI Models for Multimodal Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the foundation of these capabilities are Microsoft’s proprietary &lt;b&gt;MAI-Voice-1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;MAI-1 Preview&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;MAI-Vision-1&lt;/b&gt; models—trained in-house to handle text, voice, and visual inputs cohesively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For engineering teams managing LLM orchestration, this architecture introduces several potential efficiencies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unified multimodal reasoning&lt;/b&gt; – Reduces the need for separate ASR (speech-to-text) and image-parsing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fine-tuning continuity&lt;/b&gt; – Because Microsoft owns the model stack, updates propagate across Copilot experiences without re-integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predictable latency and governance&lt;/b&gt; – In-house hosting under Azure compliance frameworks simplifies security certification for regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presenter described the new stack as “the foundation for immersive, creative, and dynamic experiences that still respect enterprise boundaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Strategic Pivot Toward Contextual AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Microsoft positioned Copilot primarily as a productivity companion. With the Fall 2025 release, it crosses into operational AI infrastructure—a set of extensible services for reasoning over data and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman described this evolution succinctly: “Judge an AI by how much it elevates human potential, not just by its own smarts.” For CIOs and technical leads, the elevation comes from efficiency and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copilot now acts as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A connective interface linking files, communications, and cloud data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasoning agent capable of understanding context across sessions and modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secure orchestration layer compatible with Microsoft’s compliance and identity framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suleyman’s insistence that “technology should work in service of people” now extends to organizations as well: technology that serves teams, not workloads; systems that adapt to enterprise context rather than demand it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-copilot-gets-12-big-updates-for-fall-including-new-ai-assistant</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Instagram users can now use Meta AI editing tools directly in IG Stories (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/instagram-users-can-now-use-meta-ai-editing-tools-directly-in-ig-stories/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new features can be found in the “Restyle” menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose “add,” “remove,” or “change” to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061623" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the image’s style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like it’s snowing or add flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s important to note that when you’re using Meta AI on Instagram, you’re accepting Meta’s AI Terms of Service, which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3061624" height="373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a “Write with Meta AI” prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Eight-figure annual recurring revenue. Twenty thousand new users joining daily. These are some solid numbers for a startup called Turbo AI launched in early 2024 by Rudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, two 20-year-old college dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most of this growth has come in the past six months, the founders tell TechCrunch, during which their AI-powered note-taking and study tool grew from one million to five million users, while remaining profitable.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They say the idea for Turbo stemmed from a classroom problem many college students face, which is trying to take notes while paying attention to a lecture at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I would always struggle with taking notes because I just couldn’t both listen to the teacher and write at the same time. I just couldn’t do it,” said CEO Dhawan. “Every time I tried to take notes, I’d stop paying attention. And when I listened, I couldn’t take notes. I was like, what if I could use AI?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So the pair built Turbolearn as a side project to allow them to record lectures and automatically generate notes, flashcards, and quizzes. They began sharing it with friends, then it spread to classmates across Duke and Northwestern, where they were enrolled until dropping out this year. Within months, the app had reached other universities, including Harvard and MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The product takes the usual note-taker formula—record, transcribe, summarize—and makes it interactive with study notes, quizzes, and flashcards, along with a built-in chat assistant that explains key terms or concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, recordings in large halls often pick up background noise, so the founders built features that allow students to upload PDFs, lectures, YouTube videos, or readings instead. That’s now a more common use case than live lecture recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Students will upload a 30-page lecture and spend two hours going through 75 quiz questions in a row. You don’t do that unless it’s really working,” said Dhawan, noting that students love how the product saves time and helps them retain information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not just students using Turbo AI, though—as reflected by the name change from Turbolearn (a study app) to Turbo AI (an AI notetaker and learning assistant). Professionals have adopted it too, including consultants, lawyers, doctors, and even analysts at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, the founders say. Some, for instance, upload reports and use Turbo to generate summaries or convert them into podcasts they can listen to on their commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arora and Dhawan have been friends since middle school and have collaborated on multiple projects over the years. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dhawan previously built UMax, an advice app that promised to make people more attractive and reached #1 on the App Store with 20 million users and $6 million in annual revenue. Arora, meanwhile, specializes in using social media strategies to drive explosive growth and attract millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building viral apps is a rare skill. But despite the scale of their previous projects, the founders only felt the need to drop out for Turbo because they saw an opportunity to build a lasting business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, unlike many fast-growing AI companies, they’re cautious about raising too much money too early, having taken in only $750,000 last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We raised that before we had a lot of traction. Since then, we’ve had a lot of inbound interest, but we’re taking our time because we’re cash-flow positive and have been profitable our entire time as a company,” said Arora, who added that their 15-person team is based in Los Angeles and focused on staying close to student and creator communities at colleges like UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Students pay about $20 a month for the product, but the founders say they’re exploring other pricing options to reflect the price sensitivity of students, even as the app scales beyond the target group. “Right now, we’re experimenting with other pricing and running a lot of A/B tests to see what works,” Arora added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Turbo AI sits between fully manual tools like Google Docs and fully automated note-takers like Otter or Fireflies. Users can let the AI take notes or write alongside it, the founders say. That approach has helped Turbo stand out even as competitors like Y Combinator–backed YouLearn target similar student audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s cool now is that when students think of an AI notetaker or AI study tool, we’re the first ones that come to mind,” Dhawan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software product, which had not been released to the public, is designed to work alongside you throughout your day, as you use apps on the computer, writing, planning, coding, and more. Similar to AI browsers, Sky can see what’s on the your screen and take action in your apps for you.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is a significant step toward embedding OpenAI’s technology into consumers’ everyday lives and within businesses that run on Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That’s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We’re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people,” Software Applications co-founder and CEO Ari Weinstein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, the team behind Sky had another prominent exit before this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Weinstein and Conrad Kramer previously co-founded Workflow, which they sold to Apple, where it became the technology now known as Shortcuts. Both continued to work at Apple for several years before leaving to found Software Applications in August 2023. Sky’s third co-founder and COO, Kim Beverett, was a senior program and product manager at Apple, where she spent nearly 10 years working on technology like Safari, WebKit, Privacy, Messages, Mail, Phone, FaceTime, and SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apple, which has so far been behind on AI, is expected to launch an overhauled Siri with AI smarts next year. Apple has already shipped other features that use its AI tech known as Apple Intelligence, including writing helpers, live translation, image creation, visual search, and more. It’s also working with OpenAI to shuffle off queries Siri can’t answer to ChatGPT. Apple Intelligence works across platforms, including Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Apple offers a Foundation Models framework that provides access to local AI models, allowing developers to build AI into their apps directly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Apple values privacy as a core part of its AI offering, and an agentic system that views your screen and takes action on your behalf could raise concerns for some of its more security-minded customers. Agentic AI is still in its early days, and recent reviews indicate that AI browsers have a lot of safety risks. It could take Apple time to launch a Mac AI system comparable to Sky, as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deal terms for OpenAI’s acquistion were not revealed, but Sky’s maker had raised $6.5 million from investors, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Context Ventures, and Stellation Capital, according to data from Pitchbook. OpenAI disclosed that Altman held a passive interest in the startup through an investment fund. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal was led by Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley and OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, and approved by OpenAI’s board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software product, which had not been released to the public, is designed to work alongside you throughout your day, as you use apps on the computer, writing, planning, coding, and more. Similar to AI browsers, Sky can see what’s on the your screen and take action in your apps for you.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is a significant step toward embedding OpenAI’s technology into consumers’ everyday lives and within businesses that run on Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That’s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We’re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people,” Software Applications co-founder and CEO Ari Weinstein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On the surface, it seems obvious that training an LLM with “high quality” data will lead to better performance than feeding it any old “low quality” junk you can find. Now, a group of researchers is attempting to quantify just how much this kind of low quality data can cause an LLM to experience effects akin to human “brain rot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a pre-print paper published this month, the researchers from Texas A&amp;amp;M, the University of Texas, and Purdue University drew inspiration from existing research showing how humans who consume “large volumes of trivial and unchallenging online content” can develop problems with attention, memory, and social cognition. That led them to what they’re calling the “LLM brain rot hypothesis,” summed up as the idea that “continual pre-training on junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what counts as “junk web text” and what counts as “quality content” is far from a simple or fully objective process, of course. But the researchers used a few different metrics to tease a “junk dataset” and “control dataset” from HuggingFace’s corpus of 100 million tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since brain rot in humans is “a consequence of Internet addiction,” they write, junk tweets should be ones “that can maximize users’ engagement in a trivial manner.” As such, the researchers created one “junk” dataset by collecting tweets with high engagement numbers (likes, retweets, replies, and quotes) and shorter lengths, figuring that “more popular but shorter tweets will be considered to be junk data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second “junk” metric, the researchers drew from marketing research to define the “semantic quality” of the tweets themselves. Using a complex GPT-4o prompt, they sought to pull out tweets that focused on “superficial topics (like conspiracy theories, exaggerated claims, unsupported assertions or superficial lifestyle content)” or that had an “attention-drawing style (such as sensationalized headlines using clickbait language or excessive trigger words).” A random sample of these LLM-based classifications was spot-checked against evaluations from three graduate students with a 76 percent matching rate.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two separate (but partially overlapping) “junk” data sets defined, the researchers pre-trained four LLMs using different ratios of “junk” and “control” data. They then ran those variably trained models through benchmarks to measure reasoning capability (ARC AI2 Reasoning Challenge), long-context memory (RULER), adherence to ethical norms (HH-RLHF and AdvBench), and demonstrated “personality style” (TRAIT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that adding more “junk data” to the training sets had a statistically significant effect on the reasoning and long-context benchmarks across models. The effects were more mixed on the other benchmarks, though. For example, a 50/50 mix of “junk” and control data used for the Llama 8B model generated better scores on some benchmarks (ethical norms, high Openness, low Neuroticism, and Machiavellianism) than either “fully junk” or “fully control” training data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers warn that “heavily relying on Internet data leads LLM pre-training to the trap of content contamination.” They go on to “call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices” and warn that “careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms” in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be especially true as more and more of the Internet is taken up by AI-generated content that may contribute to “model collapse” if used to train future models. But we can always just destroy a bunch of print books to get quality training data, right?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two separate (but partially overlapping) “junk” data sets defined, the researchers pre-trained four LLMs using different ratios of “junk” and “control” data. They then ran those variably trained models through benchmarks to measure reasoning capability (ARC AI2 Reasoning Challenge), long-context memory (RULER), adherence to ethical norms (HH-RLHF and AdvBench), and demonstrated “personality style” (TRAIT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that adding more “junk data” to the training sets had a statistically significant effect on the reasoning and long-context benchmarks across models. The effects were more mixed on the other benchmarks, though. For example, a 50/50 mix of “junk” and control data used for the Llama 8B model generated better scores on some benchmarks (ethical norms, high Openness, low Neuroticism, and Machiavellianism) than either “fully junk” or “fully control” training data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers warn that “heavily relying on Internet data leads LLM pre-training to the trap of content contamination.” They go on to “call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices” and warn that “careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms” in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be especially true as more and more of the Internet is taken up by AI-generated content that may contribute to “model collapse” if used to train future models. But we can always just destroy a bunch of print books to get quality training data, right?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Reddit accused an AI search engine, Perplexity, of conspiring with several companies to illegally scrape Reddit content from Google search results, allegedly dodging anti-scraping methods that require substantial investments from both Google and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit alleged that Perplexity feeds off Reddit and Google, claiming to be “the world’s first answer engine” but really doing “nothing groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Its answer engine simply uses a different company’s” large language model “to parse through a massive number of Google search results to see if it can answer a user’s question based on those results,” the lawsuit said. “But Perplexity can only run its ‘answer engine’ by wrongfully accessing and scraping Reddit content appearing in Google’s own search results from Google’s own search engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likening companies involved in the alleged conspiracy to “bank robbers,” Reddit claimed it caught Perplexity “red-handed” stealing content that its “answer engine” should not have had access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baiting Perplexity with “the digital equivalent of marked bills,” Reddit tested out posting content that could only be found in Google search engine results pages (SERPs) and “within hours, queries to Perplexity’s ‘answer engine’ produced the contents of that test post.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its ‘answer engine’ is if it and/or its Co-Defendants scraped Google SERPs for that Reddit content and Perplexity then quickly incorporated that data into its answer engine,” Reddit’s lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Reddit post, Perplexity denied any wrongdoing, describing its answer engine as summarizing Reddit discussions and citing Reddit threads in answers, just like anyone who shares links or posts on Reddit might do. Perplexity suggested that Reddit was attacking the open Internet by trying to extort licensing fees for Reddit content, despite knowing that Perplexity doesn’t train foundational models. Reddit’s endgame, Perplexity alleged, was to use the Perplexity lawsuit as a “show of force in Reddit’s training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“We won’t be extorted, and we won’t help Reddit extort Google, even if they’re our (huge) competitor,” Perplexity wrote. “Perplexity will play fair, but we won’t cave. And we won’t let bigger companies use us in shell games. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit likely anticipated Perplexity’s defense of the “open Internet,” noting in its complaint that “Reddit’s current Robots Exclusion Protocol file (‘robots.txt’) says, ‘Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google reveals how scrapers steal from search results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To block scraping, Reddit uses various measures, such as “registered user-identification limits, IP-rate limits, captcha bot protection, and anomaly-detection tools,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Google relies on “anti-scraping systems and teams dedicated to preventing unauthorized access to its products and services,” Reddit said, noting Google prohibits “unauthorized automated access” to its SERPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To back its claims, Reddit subpoenaed Google to find out more about how the search giant blocks AI scrapers from accessing content on SERPs. Google confirmed it relies on “a technological access control system called ‘SearchGuard,’ which is designed to prevent automated systems from accessing and obtaining wholesale search results and indexed data while allowing individual users—i.e., humans—access to Google’s search results, including results that feature Reddit data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“SearchGuard prevents unauthorized access to Google’s search data by imposing a barrier challenge that cannot be solved in the ordinary course by automated systems unless they take affirmative actions to circumvent the SearchGuard system,” Reddit’s complaint explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing these anti-scraping systems violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Reddit alleged, as well as laws against unfair trade and unjust enrichment. Seemingly, Google’s SearchGuard may currently be the easiest to bypass for alleged conspirators who supposedly pivoted to looting Google SERPs after realizing they couldn’t access Reddit content directly on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scrapers shocked by Reddit lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit accused three companies of conspiring with Perplexity—”a Lithuanian data scraper” called Oxylabs UAB, “a former Russian botnet” known as AWMProxy, and SerpApi, a Texas company that sells services for scraping search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxylabs “is explicit that its scraping service is meant to circumvent Google’s technological measures,” Reddit alleged, pointing to an Oxylabs’ website called “How to Scrape Google Search Results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerpApi touts&amp;nbsp;the same service, including some options to scrape SERPs at “ludicrous speeds.” To trick browsers, SerpApi’s fastest option uses “a server-swarm to hide from, avoid, or simply overwhelm by brute force effective measures Google has put in place to ward off automated access to search engine results,” Reddit alleged. SerpApi also allegedly provides users “with tips to reduce the chance of being blocked while web scraping, such as by sending ‘fake user-agent string[s],’ shifting IP addresses to avoid multiple requests from the same address, and using proxies ‘to make traffic look like regular user traffic’ and thereby ‘impersonate’ user traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reddit, the three companies disguise “their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.” During a two-week span in July, they scraped “almost three billion” SERPs containing Reddit text, URLs, images, and videos, a subpoena requesting information from Google revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach AWMProxy for comment. However, the other companies were surprised by Reddit’s lawsuit, while vowing to defend their business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerpApi’s spokesperson told Ars that Reddit did not notify the company before filing the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We strongly disagree with Reddit’s allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in court,” SerpApi’s spokesperson said. “In the eight years we’ve been in business, SerpApi has always operated on the right side of the law. As stated on our website, ‘The crawling and parsing of public data is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We value freedom of speech tremendously.’”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, SerpAPI works “closely with our attorneys to ensure that our services comply with all applicable laws and fair use principles. SerpApi stands firmly behind its business model and conduct, and we will continue to defend our rights to the fullest extent,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxylabs’ chief governance strategy officer, Denas Grybauskas, told Ars that Reddit’s complaint seemed baffling since the other companies involved in the litigation are “unrelated and unaffiliated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are shocked and disappointed by this news, as Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,” Grybauskas said. “Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs’ position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grybauskas defended Oxylabs’ business as creating “real-world value for thousands of businesses and researchers, such as those driving open-source investigations, disinformation tackling, or environmental monitoring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We strongly believe that our core business principles make the Internet a better place and serve the public good,” Grybauskas said. “Oxylabs provides infrastructure for compliant access to publicly available information, and we demand every customer to use our services lawfully. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reddit cited threats to licensing deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Reddit caught on to the alleged scheme after sending cease-and-desist letters to Perplexity to stop scraping Reddit content that its answer engine was citing. Rather than ending the scraping, Reddit claimed Perplexity’s citations increased “forty-fold.” Since Perplexity is a customer listed on SerpApi’s website, Reddit hypothesized the two were conspiring to skirt Google’s anti-circumvention tools, the complaint said, along with the other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement provided to Ars, Ben Lee, chief legal officer at Reddit, said that Oxylabs, AWMProxy, and SerpApi were “textbook examples” of scrapers that “bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unable to scrape Reddit directly, they mask their identities, hide their locations, and disguise their web scrapers to steal Reddit content from Google Search,” Lee said. “Perplexity is a willing customer of at least one of these scrapers, choosing to buy stolen data rather than enter into a lawful agreement with Reddit itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Reddit, Perplexity pushed back on Reddit’s claims that Perplexity ignored requests to license Reddit content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Untrue. Whenever anyone asks us about content licensing, we explain that Perplexity, as an application-layer company, does not train AI models on content,” Perplexity said. “Never has. So, it is impossible for us to sign a license agreement to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit supposedly “insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data,” Perplexity said. “Bowing to strong arm&amp;nbsp;tactics just isn’t how we do business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s spokesperson, Jesse Dwyer, told Ars the company chose to post its statement on Reddit “to illustrate a simple point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a public Reddit link accessible to anyone, yet by the logic of Reddit’s lawsuit, if you mention it or cite it in any way (which is your job as a reporter), they might just sue you,” Dwyer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Reddit claimed that its business and reputation have been “damaged” by “misappropriation of Reddit data and circumvention of technological control measures.” Without a licensing deal ensuring that Perplexity and others are respecting Reddit policies, Reddit cannot control who has access to data, how they’re using data, and if data use conflicts with Reddit’s privacy policy and user agreement, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Reddit’s worried that Perplexity’s workaround could catch on, potentially messing up Reddit’s other licensing deals. All the while, Reddit noted, it has to invest “significant resources” in anti-scraping technology, with Reddit ultimately suffering damages, including “lost profits and business opportunities, reputational harm, and loss of user trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s hoping the court will grant an injunction barring companies from scraping Reddit content from Google SERPs. It also wants companies blocked from both selling Reddit data and “developing or distributing any technology or product that is used for the unauthorized circumvention of technological control measures and scraping of Reddit data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Reddit wins, companies could be required to pay substantial damages or to disgorge profits from the sale of Reddit content.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Reddit accused an AI search engine, Perplexity, of conspiring with several companies to illegally scrape Reddit content from Google search results, allegedly dodging anti-scraping methods that require substantial investments from both Google and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit alleged that Perplexity feeds off Reddit and Google, claiming to be “the world’s first answer engine” but really doing “nothing groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Its answer engine simply uses a different company’s” large language model “to parse through a massive number of Google search results to see if it can answer a user’s question based on those results,” the lawsuit said. “But Perplexity can only run its ‘answer engine’ by wrongfully accessing and scraping Reddit content appearing in Google’s own search results from Google’s own search engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likening companies involved in the alleged conspiracy to “bank robbers,” Reddit claimed it caught Perplexity “red-handed” stealing content that its “answer engine” should not have had access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baiting Perplexity with “the digital equivalent of marked bills,” Reddit tested out posting content that could only be found in Google search engine results pages (SERPs) and “within hours, queries to Perplexity’s ‘answer engine’ produced the contents of that test post.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its ‘answer engine’ is if it and/or its Co-Defendants scraped Google SERPs for that Reddit content and Perplexity then quickly incorporated that data into its answer engine,” Reddit’s lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Reddit post, Perplexity denied any wrongdoing, describing its answer engine as summarizing Reddit discussions and citing Reddit threads in answers, just like anyone who shares links or posts on Reddit might do. Perplexity suggested that Reddit was attacking the open Internet by trying to extort licensing fees for Reddit content, despite knowing that Perplexity doesn’t train foundational models. Reddit’s endgame, Perplexity alleged, was to use the Perplexity lawsuit as a “show of force in Reddit’s training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“We won’t be extorted, and we won’t help Reddit extort Google, even if they’re our (huge) competitor,” Perplexity wrote. “Perplexity will play fair, but we won’t cave. And we won’t let bigger companies use us in shell games. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit likely anticipated Perplexity’s defense of the “open Internet,” noting in its complaint that “Reddit’s current Robots Exclusion Protocol file (‘robots.txt’) says, ‘Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google reveals how scrapers steal from search results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To block scraping, Reddit uses various measures, such as “registered user-identification limits, IP-rate limits, captcha bot protection, and anomaly-detection tools,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Google relies on “anti-scraping systems and teams dedicated to preventing unauthorized access to its products and services,” Reddit said, noting Google prohibits “unauthorized automated access” to its SERPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To back its claims, Reddit subpoenaed Google to find out more about how the search giant blocks AI scrapers from accessing content on SERPs. Google confirmed it relies on “a technological access control system called ‘SearchGuard,’ which is designed to prevent automated systems from accessing and obtaining wholesale search results and indexed data while allowing individual users—i.e., humans—access to Google’s search results, including results that feature Reddit data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“SearchGuard prevents unauthorized access to Google’s search data by imposing a barrier challenge that cannot be solved in the ordinary course by automated systems unless they take affirmative actions to circumvent the SearchGuard system,” Reddit’s complaint explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing these anti-scraping systems violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Reddit alleged, as well as laws against unfair trade and unjust enrichment. Seemingly, Google’s SearchGuard may currently be the easiest to bypass for alleged conspirators who supposedly pivoted to looting Google SERPs after realizing they couldn’t access Reddit content directly on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scrapers shocked by Reddit lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit accused three companies of conspiring with Perplexity—”a Lithuanian data scraper” called Oxylabs UAB, “a former Russian botnet” known as AWMProxy, and SerpApi, a Texas company that sells services for scraping search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxylabs “is explicit that its scraping service is meant to circumvent Google’s technological measures,” Reddit alleged, pointing to an Oxylabs’ website called “How to Scrape Google Search Results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerpApi touts&amp;nbsp;the same service, including some options to scrape SERPs at “ludicrous speeds.” To trick browsers, SerpApi’s fastest option uses “a server-swarm to hide from, avoid, or simply overwhelm by brute force effective measures Google has put in place to ward off automated access to search engine results,” Reddit alleged. SerpApi also allegedly provides users “with tips to reduce the chance of being blocked while web scraping, such as by sending ‘fake user-agent string[s],’ shifting IP addresses to avoid multiple requests from the same address, and using proxies ‘to make traffic look like regular user traffic’ and thereby ‘impersonate’ user traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reddit, the three companies disguise “their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.” During a two-week span in July, they scraped “almost three billion” SERPs containing Reddit text, URLs, images, and videos, a subpoena requesting information from Google revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach AWMProxy for comment. However, the other companies were surprised by Reddit’s lawsuit, while vowing to defend their business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerpApi’s spokesperson told Ars that Reddit did not notify the company before filing the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We strongly disagree with Reddit’s allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in court,” SerpApi’s spokesperson said. “In the eight years we’ve been in business, SerpApi has always operated on the right side of the law. As stated on our website, ‘The crawling and parsing of public data is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We value freedom of speech tremendously.’”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, SerpAPI works “closely with our attorneys to ensure that our services comply with all applicable laws and fair use principles. SerpApi stands firmly behind its business model and conduct, and we will continue to defend our rights to the fullest extent,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxylabs’ chief governance strategy officer, Denas Grybauskas, told Ars that Reddit’s complaint seemed baffling since the other companies involved in the litigation are “unrelated and unaffiliated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are shocked and disappointed by this news, as Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,” Grybauskas said. “Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs’ position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grybauskas defended Oxylabs’ business as creating “real-world value for thousands of businesses and researchers, such as those driving open-source investigations, disinformation tackling, or environmental monitoring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We strongly believe that our core business principles make the Internet a better place and serve the public good,” Grybauskas said. “Oxylabs provides infrastructure for compliant access to publicly available information, and we demand every customer to use our services lawfully. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reddit cited threats to licensing deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Reddit caught on to the alleged scheme after sending cease-and-desist letters to Perplexity to stop scraping Reddit content that its answer engine was citing. Rather than ending the scraping, Reddit claimed Perplexity’s citations increased “forty-fold.” Since Perplexity is a customer listed on SerpApi’s website, Reddit hypothesized the two were conspiring to skirt Google’s anti-circumvention tools, the complaint said, along with the other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement provided to Ars, Ben Lee, chief legal officer at Reddit, said that Oxylabs, AWMProxy, and SerpApi were “textbook examples” of scrapers that “bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has acquired Software Applications Incorporated (SAI), perhaps best known for the core team that produced what became Shortcuts on Apple platforms. More recently, the team has been working on Sky, a context-aware AI interface layer on top of macOS. The financial terms of the acquisition have not been publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI progress isn’t only about advancing intelligence—it’s about unlocking it through interfaces that understand context, adapt to your intent, and work seamlessly,” an OpenAI rep wrote in the company’s blog post about the acquisition. The post goes on to specify that OpenAI plans to “bring Sky’s deep macOS integration and product craft into ChatGPT, and all members of the team will join OpenAI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes SAI co-founders Ari Weinstein (CEO), Conrad Kramer (CTO), and Kim Beverett (Product Lead)—all of whom worked together for several years at Apple after Apple acquired Weinstein and Kramer’s previous company, which produced an automation tool called Workflows, to integrate Shortcuts across Apple’s software platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three SAI founders left Apple to work on Sky, which leverages Apple APIs and accessibility features to provide context about what’s on screen to a large language model; the LLM takes plain language user commands and executes them across multiple applications. At its best, the tool aimed to be a bit like Shortcuts, but with no setup, generating workflows on the fly based on user prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bears some resemblance to features of Atlas, the ChatGPT-driven web browser that OpenAI launched earlier this week, and this acquisition piles on even more evidence that OpenAI has ambitions beyond a question-and-answer chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI can use the SAI team’s knowledge of the macOS platform to develop new ways for ChatGPT not just to make suggestions about, but to agentically work directly on users’ macOS environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, most of OpenAI’s native desktop efforts have been on macOS; this may be because its core audience of early adopters includes a large cohort of front-end web and mobile application developers, many of whom use macOS as their primary platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear at this point whether development on Sky will continue as originally planned or be adapted into something meaningfully different under the OpenAI umbrella—but the public statements by both companies about the acquisition suggest this is about more than just a macOS application.&lt;/p&gt;

It certainly seems that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, OpenAI has &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-company-knowledge/"&gt;launched company knowledge in ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, a major new capability for subscribers to ChatGPT&amp;#x27;s paid Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans that lets them call up their company&amp;#x27;s data directly from third-party workplace apps including Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, Gmail, GitHub, HubSpot and combine it in ChatGPT outputs to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI&amp;#x27;s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo put it in a post on the social network X: &amp;quot;it brings all the context from your apps (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, etc) together in ChatGPT so you can get answers that are specific to your business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, OpenAI&amp;#x27;s blog post on the feature states that is &amp;quot;powered by a version of GPT‑5 that’s trained to look across multiple sources to give more comprehensive and accurate answers,&amp;quot; which sounds to me like a new fine-tuned version of the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-gpt-5-not-agi-but-capable-of-generating-software-on-demand"&gt;model family the company released back in August&lt;/a&gt;, though there are no additional details on how it was trained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, company knowledge in ChatGPT is rolling out globally and is designed to make ChatGPT a central point of access for verified organizational information, supported by secure integrations and enterprise-grade compliance controls, and give employees way faster access to their company&amp;#x27;s information while working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, instead of toggling over to Slack to find the assignment you were given and instructions, or tabbing over to Google Drive and opening up specific files to find the names and numbers you need to call, ChatGPT can deliver all that type of information directly into your chat session — if your company enables the proper connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap &lt;a href="https://x.com/bradlightcap/status/1981454865454027007"&gt;wrote in a post on the social network X&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;company knowledge has changed how i use chatgpt at work more than anything we have built so far - let us know what you think!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It builds upon the third-party app connectors &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-adds-new-chatgpt-third-party-tool-connectors-to-dropbox-ms-teams-as-altman-clarifies-gpt-5-prioritization"&gt;unveiled back in August 2025&lt;/a&gt;, though those were only for individual users on the ChatGPT Plus plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting ChatGPT to Workplace Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise teams often face the challenge of fragmented data across various internal tools—email, chat, file storage, project management, and customer platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge bridges those silos by enabling ChatGPT to connect to approved systems like, and other supported apps through enterprise-managed connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each response generated with company knowledge includes citations and direct links to the original sources, allowing teams to verify where specific details originated. This transparency helps organizations maintain data trustworthiness while increasing productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI confirms that company knowledge uses a version of GPT-5 optimized for multi-source reasoning and cross-system synthesis, providing detailed, contextually accurate results even across disparate sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Built for Enterprise Control and Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge was designed from the ground up for enterprise governance and compliance. It respects existing permissions within connected apps — ChatGPT can only access what a user is already authorized to view— and never trains on company data by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security features include industry-standard encryption, support for SSO and SCIM for account provisioning, and IP allowlisting to restrict access to approved corporate networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise administrators can also define role-based access control (RBAC) policies and manage permissions at a group or department level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Enterprise Compliance API provides a full audit trail, allowing administrators to review conversation logs for reporting and regulatory purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capability helps enterprises meet internal governance standards and industry-specific requirements such as SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Admin Configuration and Connector Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise deployment, administrators must enable company knowledge and its connectors within the ChatGPT workspace. Once connectors are active, users can authenticate their own accounts for each work app they need to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Enterprise and Edu plans, connectors are off by default and require explicit admin approval before employees can use them. Admins can selectively enable connectors, manage access by role, and require SSO-based authentication for enhanced control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business plan users, by contrast, have connectors enabled automatically if available in their workspace. Admins can still oversee which connectors are approved, ensuring alignment with internal IT and data policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge becomes available to any user with at least one active connector, and admins can configure group-level permissions for different teams — such as restricting GitHub access to engineering while enabling Google Drive or HubSpot for marketing and sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Company Knowledge Works in Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating company knowledge is straightforward. Users can start a new or existing conversation in ChatGPT and select “Company knowledge” under the message composer or from the tools menu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After authenticating their connected apps, they can ask questions as usual—such as “Summarize this account’s latest feedback and risks” or “Compile a Q4 performance summary from project trackers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT searches across the connected tools, retrieves relevant context, and produces an answer with full citations and source links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can combine data across apps — for instance, blending Slack updates, Google Docs notes, and HubSpot CRM records — to create an integrated view of a project, client, or initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When company knowledge is not selected, ChatGPT may still use connectors in a limited capacity as part of the default experience, but responses will not include detailed citations or multi-source synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Use Cases for Enterprise Teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For development and operations leaders, company knowledge can act as a centralized intelligence layer that surfaces real-time updates and dependencies across complex workflows. ChatGPT can, for example, summarize open GitHub pull requests, highlight unresolved Linear tickets, and cross-reference Slack engineering discussions—all in a single output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical teams can also use it for incident retrospectives or release planning by pulling relevant information from issue trackers, logs, and meeting notes. Procurement or finance leaders can use it to consolidate purchase requests or budget updates across shared drives and internal communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model can reference structured and unstructured data simultaneously, it supports wide-ranging scenarios—from compliance documentation reviews to cross-departmental performance summaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy, Data Residency, and Compliance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise data protection is a central design element of company knowledge. ChatGPT processes data in line with OpenAI’s enterprise-grade security model, ensuring that no connected app data leaves the secure boundary of the organization’s authorized environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data residency policies vary by connector. Certain integrations, such as Slack, support region-specific data storage, while others—like Google Drive and SharePoint—are available for U.S.-based customers with or without at-rest data residency. Organizations with regional compliance obligations can review connector-specific security documentation for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No geo restrictions apply to company knowledge, making it suitable for multinational organizations operating across multiple jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limitations and Future Enhancements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, users must manually enable company knowledge in each new ChatGPT conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is developing a unified interface that will automatically integrate company knowledge with other ChatGPT tools—such as browsing and chart generation—so that users won’t need to toggle between modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enabled, company knowledge temporarily disables web browsing and visual output generation, though users can switch modes within the same conversation to re-enable those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also continues to expand the network of supported tools. Recent updates have added connectors for Asana, GitLab Issues, and ClickUp, and OpenAI plans to support future MCP (Model Context Protocol) connectors to enable custom, developer-built integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several important details about &lt;i&gt;company knowledge&lt;/i&gt; remain unclear based on OpenAI’s published materials. It’s not yet known whether the system can detect and exclude information labeled as confidential, whether organizations can opt in or out of data training separately for this feature, or if users will eventually be able to select which model powers it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has also not said whether this version of GPT-5 is new or specific to the feature, or what service-level guarantees exist to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucinations in company-specific responses. VentureBeat has emailed OpenAI spokespeople with these and related questions and is awaiting a response, which we will publish if and when we receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Availability and Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge is now available to all ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Edu users. Organizations can begin by enabling the feature under the ChatGPT message composer and connecting approved work apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise rollouts, OpenAI recommends a phased deployment: first enabling core connectors (such as Google Drive and Slack), configuring RBAC and SSO, then expanding to specialized systems once data access policies are verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procurement and security leaders evaluating the feature should note that company knowledge is covered under existing ChatGPT Enterprise terms and uses the same encryption, compliance, and service-level guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With company knowledge, OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT not just a conversational assistant but an intelligent interface to enterprise data—delivering secure, context-aware insights that help technical and business leaders act with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Is the Google Search for internal enterprise knowledge finally here...but from &lt;i&gt;OpenAI&lt;/i&gt;? It certainly seems that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, OpenAI has &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-company-knowledge/"&gt;launched company knowledge in ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, a major new capability for subscribers to ChatGPT&amp;#x27;s paid Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans that lets them call up their company&amp;#x27;s data directly from third-party workplace apps including Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, Gmail, GitHub, HubSpot and combine it in ChatGPT outputs to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI&amp;#x27;s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo put it in a post on the social network X: &amp;quot;it brings all the context from your apps (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, etc) together in ChatGPT so you can get answers that are specific to your business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, OpenAI&amp;#x27;s blog post on the feature states that is &amp;quot;powered by a version of GPT‑5 that’s trained to look across multiple sources to give more comprehensive and accurate answers,&amp;quot; which sounds to me like a new fine-tuned version of the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-gpt-5-not-agi-but-capable-of-generating-software-on-demand"&gt;model family the company released back in August&lt;/a&gt;, though there are no additional details on how it was trained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, company knowledge in ChatGPT is rolling out globally and is designed to make ChatGPT a central point of access for verified organizational information, supported by secure integrations and enterprise-grade compliance controls, and give employees way faster access to their company&amp;#x27;s information while working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, instead of toggling over to Slack to find the assignment you were given and instructions, or tabbing over to Google Drive and opening up specific files to find the names and numbers you need to call, ChatGPT can deliver all that type of information directly into your chat session — if your company enables the proper connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap &lt;a href="https://x.com/bradlightcap/status/1981454865454027007"&gt;wrote in a post on the social network X&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;company knowledge has changed how i use chatgpt at work more than anything we have built so far - let us know what you think!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It builds upon the third-party app connectors &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-adds-new-chatgpt-third-party-tool-connectors-to-dropbox-ms-teams-as-altman-clarifies-gpt-5-prioritization"&gt;unveiled back in August 2025&lt;/a&gt;, though those were only for individual users on the ChatGPT Plus plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting ChatGPT to Workplace Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise teams often face the challenge of fragmented data across various internal tools—email, chat, file storage, project management, and customer platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge bridges those silos by enabling ChatGPT to connect to approved systems like, and other supported apps through enterprise-managed connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each response generated with company knowledge includes citations and direct links to the original sources, allowing teams to verify where specific details originated. This transparency helps organizations maintain data trustworthiness while increasing productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI confirms that company knowledge uses a version of GPT-5 optimized for multi-source reasoning and cross-system synthesis, providing detailed, contextually accurate results even across disparate sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Built for Enterprise Control and Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge was designed from the ground up for enterprise governance and compliance. It respects existing permissions within connected apps — ChatGPT can only access what a user is already authorized to view— and never trains on company data by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security features include industry-standard encryption, support for SSO and SCIM for account provisioning, and IP allowlisting to restrict access to approved corporate networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise administrators can also define role-based access control (RBAC) policies and manage permissions at a group or department level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Enterprise Compliance API provides a full audit trail, allowing administrators to review conversation logs for reporting and regulatory purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capability helps enterprises meet internal governance standards and industry-specific requirements such as SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Admin Configuration and Connector Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise deployment, administrators must enable company knowledge and its connectors within the ChatGPT workspace. Once connectors are active, users can authenticate their own accounts for each work app they need to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Enterprise and Edu plans, connectors are off by default and require explicit admin approval before employees can use them. Admins can selectively enable connectors, manage access by role, and require SSO-based authentication for enhanced control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business plan users, by contrast, have connectors enabled automatically if available in their workspace. Admins can still oversee which connectors are approved, ensuring alignment with internal IT and data policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company knowledge becomes available to any user with at least one active connector, and admins can configure group-level permissions for different teams — such as restricting GitHub access to engineering while enabling Google Drive or HubSpot for marketing and sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Company Knowledge Works in Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating company knowledge is straightforward.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel’s revenue results and its $4.1 billion in net income provides a far rosier view than its string of quarterly losses. But the company’s recovery story deserves several chapters dedicated to cost cutting via layoffs and other reductions as well as a series of high-profile investments from Softbank, Nvidia, and the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel added $20 billion to its balance sheet during the third quarter, the company announced on its third-quarter earnings presentation on Thursday, sending its stock soaring. This growth was largely due to three sizable investments in the company over the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In August, SoftBank invested $2 billion. A few days later, the U.S. Government took an unprecedented 10% equity stake in Intel. The company has received $5.7 billion of the planned $8.9 billion from the U.S. Government thus far. Nvidia also bought a $5 billion stake in Intel in September as part of a broader deal to develop chips together over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The actions we took to strengthen the balance sheet give us greater operational flexibility and position us well to continue to execute our strategy with confidence,” Tan said on the company’s earnings call. “In particular, I’m honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and Secretary [Howard] Lutnick have placed in me. Their support highlights Intel’s strategic role as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company with leading edge logic, [research and development] and manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also received $5.2 billion from closing the sale of its ownership stake of Altera, a hardware company it had owned since 2015, on September 12. It also sold its stake in Mobileye, an autonomous driving tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel grew its quarterly revenue by $800 million in the third quarter to $13.7 billion, compared to $12.9 billion. Intel had net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, a steep reversal from the $16.6 billion loss it reported in the same year-ago period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-foundry-biz"&gt;The foundry biz &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the strong quarter, there weren’t many details on what will happen next with Intel’s foundry business, which makes custom chips for customers. The business has floundered from the start and has been a focus of Tan, who initiated significant layoffs in its foundry business this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The business appears to be a priority of the Trump administration; a key condition of the government’s investment in Intel includes language that it will penalize Intel if it divested from its foundry business over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wall Street is keeping a close eye on foundry for signs of the company’s long-term growth. Intel analysts told TechCrunch in August that the company did not need cash to turn itself around but rather a strategy to get its foundry business on track.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tan said that Intel thinks its foundry business is “uniquely positioned” to capitalize on the swelling demand for chips but was light on the details — beyond saying that the company is actively engaging with potential foundry customers — and added that the growth of the foundry business would remain disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Building a world-class foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust,” Tan said. “As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they count on us to build wafers, to meet all their needs for powerful performance, yield, cost, and schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228936694.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Intel’s third-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations Thursday, results buoyed by a bump in revenue combined with larger cuts, and multiple, sizable investments over the last two months as CEO Lip-Bu Tan looks to turn around the struggling semiconductor giant.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How can you use science to build a better gingerbread house?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was something Miranda Schwacke spent a lot of time thinking about. The MIT graduate student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) is part of&amp;nbsp;Kitchen Matters, a group of grad students who use food and kitchen tools to explain scientific concepts&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;short videos and outreach events. Past topics included why chocolate “seizes,” or becomes difficult to work with when melting (spoiler: water gets in), and how to make isomalt, the sugar glass that stunt performers jump through in action movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when the group was making a video on&amp;nbsp;how to build a structurally sound gingerbread house, Schwacke scoured cookbooks for a variable that would produce the most dramatic difference in the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was reading about what determines the texture of cookies, and then tried several recipes in my kitchen until I got two gingerbread recipes that I was happy with,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focused on&amp;nbsp;butter, which contains water that turns to steam at high baking temperatures, creating air pockets in cookies. Schwacke predicted that decreasing the amount of butter would yield denser gingerbread, strong enough to hold together as a house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis is an example of how changing the structure can influence the properties and performance of material,” Schwacke said in the eight-minute video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same curiosity about materials properties and performance drives her research on the high energy cost of computing, especially for artificial intelligence. Schwacke develops new materials and devices for neuromorphic computing, which mimics the brain by processing and storing information in the same place. She studies electrochemical ionic synapses — tiny devices that can be “tuned” to adjust conductivity, much like neurons strengthening or weakening connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at AI in particular — to&amp;nbsp;train these really large models — that consumes a lot of energy. And if you compare that to the amount of energy that we consume as humans when we’re learning things, the brain consumes a lot less energy,” Schwacke says. “That’s what led to this idea to find more brain-inspired, energy-efficient ways of doing AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advisor, Bilge Yildiz, underscores the point: One reason the brain is so efficient is that data doesn’t need to be moved back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, the connections between our neurons, called synapses, are where we process information. Signal transmission is there. It is processed, programmed, and also stored in the same place,” says Yildiz, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and DMSE. Schwacke’s devices aim to replicate that efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a marine biologist mom and an electrical engineer dad, Schwacke was immersed in science from a young age. Science was “always a part of how I understood the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was obsessed with dinosaurs. I wanted to be a paleontologist when I grew up,” she says. But her interests broadened. At her middle school in Charleston, South Carolina, she joined a FIRST Lego League robotics competition, building robots to complete tasks like pushing or pulling objects. “My parents, my dad especially, got very involved in the school team and helping us design and build our little robot for the competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother, meanwhile, studied how dolphin populations are affected by pollution for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That had a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was an example of how science can be used to understand the world, and also to figure out how we can improve the world,” Schwacke says. “And that’s what I’ve always wanted to do with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her interest in materials science came later, in&amp;nbsp;her&amp;nbsp;high school&amp;nbsp;magnet program. There, she was introduced to the interdisciplinary subject, a blend of physics, chemistry, and engineering that studies the structure and properties of materials and uses that knowledge to design new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always liked that it goes from this very basic science, where we’re studying how atoms are ordering, all the way up to these solid materials that we interact with in our everyday lives — and how that gives them their properties that we can see and play with,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior, she participated in a research program with a thesis project on dye-sensitized solar cells, a low-cost, lightweight solar technology that uses dye molecules to absorb light and generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What drove me was really understanding, this is how we go from light to energy that we can use — and also seeing how this could help us with having more renewable energy sources,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After high school, she headed across the country to Caltech. “I wanted to try a totally new place,” she says, where she studied materials science, including nanostructured materials thousands of times thinner than a human hair. She focused on materials properties and microstructure — the tiny internal structure that governs how materials behave — which led her to electrochemical systems like batteries and fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI energy challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, she continued exploring energy technologies. She met Yildiz during a Zoom meeting in her first year of graduate school, in fall 2020, when the campus was still operating under strict Covid-19 protocols.&amp;nbsp;Yildiz’s lab studies how charged atoms, or ions, move through materials in technologies like fuel cells, batteries, and electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab’s research into brain-inspired computing fired Schwacke’s imagination, but she was equally drawn to Yildiz’s way of talking about science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t based on jargon and emphasized a very basic understanding of what was going on — that ions are going here, and electrons are going here — to understand fundamentally what’s happening in the system,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mindset shaped her approach to research. Her early projects focused on the properties these devices need to work well — fast operation, low energy use, and compatibility with semiconductor technology — and on using magnesium ions instead of hydrogen, which can escape into the environment and make devices unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her current project, the focus of her PhD thesis, centers on understanding how the insertion of magnesium ions into tungsten oxide, a metal oxide whose electrical properties can be precisely tuned, changes its electrical resistance. In these devices, tungsten oxide serves as a channel layer, where resistance controls signal strength, much like synapses regulate signals in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am trying to understand exactly how these devices change the channel conductance,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke’s research was recognized with a MathWorks Fellowship from the School of Engineering in 2023 and 2024. The fellowship supports graduate students who leverage tools like MATLAB or Simulink in their work; Schwacke applied MATLAB for critical data analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yildiz describes Schwacke’s research as a novel step toward solving one of AI’s biggest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is electrochemistry for brain-inspired computing,” Yildiz says. “It’s a new context for electrochemistry, but also with an energy implication, because the energy consumption of computing is unsustainably increasing. We have to find new ways of doing computing with much lower energy, and this is one way that can help us move in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any pioneering work, it comes with challenges, especially in bridging the concepts between electrochemistry and semiconductor physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our group comes from a solid-state chemistry background, and when we started this work looking into magnesium, no one had used magnesium in these kinds of devices before,” Schwacke says. “So we were looking at the magnesium battery literature for inspiration and different materials and strategies we could use. When I started this, I wasn’t just learning the language and norms for one field — I was trying to learn it for two fields, and also translate between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also grapples with a challenge familiar to all scientists: how to make sense of messy data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main challenge is being able to take my data and know that I’m interpreting it in a way that’s correct, and that I understand what it actually means,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She overcomes hurdles by collaborating closely with colleagues across fields, including neuroscience and electrical engineering, and sometimes by just making small changes to her experiments and watching what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke is not just active in the lab. In Kitchen Matters, she and her fellow DMSE grad students set up booths at local events like the Cambridge Science Fair and Steam It Up, an after-school program with hands-on activities for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did ‘pHun with Food’ with ‘fun’ spelled with a pH, so we had cabbage juice as a pH indicator,” Schwacke says. “We let the kids test the pH of lemon juice and vinegar and dish soap, and they had a lot of fun mixing the different liquids and seeing all the different colors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also served as the social chair and treasurer for DMSE’s graduate student group, the Graduate Materials Council. As an undergraduate at Caltech, she led workshops in science and technology for Robogals, a student-run group that encourages young women to pursue careers in science, and assisted students in applying for the school’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Schwacke, these experiences sharpened her ability to explain science to different audiences, a skill she sees as vital whether she’s presenting at a kids’ fair or at a research conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always think, where is my audience starting from, and what do I need to explain before I can get into what I’m doing so that it’ll all make sense to them?” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwacke sees the ability to communicate as central to building community, which she considers an important part of doing research. “It helps with spreading ideas. It always helps to get a new perspective on what you’re working on,” she says. “I also think it keeps us sane during our PhD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yildiz sees Schwacke’s community involvement as an important part of her resume. “She’s doing all these activities to motivate the broader community to do research, to be interested in science, to pursue science and technology, but that ability will help her also progress in her own research and academic endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her PhD, Schwacke wants to take that ability to communicate with her to academia, where she’d like to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. Yildiz&amp;nbsp;has no doubt she’ll thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think she’s a perfect fit,” Yildiz says. “She’s brilliant, but brilliance by itself is not enough. She’s persistent, resilient. You really need those on top of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How can you use science to build a better gingerbread house?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was something Miranda Schwacke spent a lot of time thinking about. The MIT graduate student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) is part of&amp;nbsp;Kitchen Matters, a group of grad students who use food and kitchen tools to explain scientific concepts&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;short videos and outreach events. Past topics included why chocolate “seizes,” or becomes difficult to work with when melting (spoiler: water gets in), and how to make isomalt, the sugar glass that stunt performers jump through in action movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when the group was making a video on&amp;nbsp;how to build a structurally sound gingerbread house, Schwacke scoured cookbooks for a variable that would produce the most dramatic difference in the cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was reading about what determines the texture of cookies, and then tried several recipes in my kitchen until I got two gingerbread recipes that I was happy with,” Schwacke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focused on&amp;nbsp;butter, which contains water that turns to steam at high baking temperatures, creating air pockets in cookies. Schwacke predicted that decreasing the amount of butter would yield denser gingerbread, strong enough to hold together as a house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis is an example of how changing the structure can influence the properties and performance of material,” Schwacke said in the eight-minute video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same curiosity about materials properties and performance drives her research on the high energy cost of computing, especially for artificial intelligence. Schwacke develops new materials and devices for neuromorphic computing, which mimics the brain by processing and storing information in the same place. She studies electrochemical ionic synapses — tiny devices that can be “tuned” to adjust conductivity, much like neurons strengthening or weakening connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at AI in particular — to&amp;nbsp;train these really large models — that consumes a lot of energy. And if you compare that to the amount of energy that we consume as humans when we’re learning things, the brain consumes a lot less energy,” Schwacke says. “That’s what led to this idea to find more brain-inspired, energy-efficient ways of doing AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advisor, Bilge Yildiz, underscores the point: One reason the brain is so efficient is that data doesn’t need to be moved back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, the connections between our neurons, called synapses, are where we process information. Signal transmission is there. It is processed, programmed, and also stored in the same place,” says Yildiz, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and DMSE.
