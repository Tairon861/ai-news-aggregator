            &lt;p&gt;As countries across the world experience a resurgence in nuclear energy projects, the questions of where and how to dispose of nuclear waste remain as politically fraught as ever. The United States, for instance, has indefinitely stalled its only long-term underground nuclear waste repository. Scientists are using both modeling and experimental methods to study the effects of underground nuclear waste disposal and ultimately, they hope, build public trust in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from scientists at MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Orléans makes progress in that direction. The study shows that simulations of underground nuclear waste interactions, generated by new, high-performance-computing software, aligned well with experimental results from a research facility in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was co-authored by MIT PhD student Dauren Sarsenbayev and Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, along with&amp;nbsp;Christophe Tournassat and&amp;nbsp;Carl Steefel, appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These powerful new computational tools, coupled with real-world experiments like those at the Mont Terri research site in Switzerland, help us understand how radionuclides will migrate in coupled underground systems,” says Sarsenbayev, who is first author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope the research will improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research — coupling both computation and experiments — is important to improve our confidence in waste disposal safety assessments,” says Wainwright. “With nuclear energy re-emerging as a key source for tackling climate change and ensuring energy security, it is critical to validate disposal pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing simulations with experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposing of nuclear waste in deep underground geological formations is currently considered the safest long-term solution for managing high-level radioactive waste. As such, much effort has been put into studying the migration behaviors of radionuclides from nuclear waste within various natural and engineered geological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1996, the Mont Terri research site in northern Switzerland has served as an important test bed for an international consortium of researchers interested in studying materials like Opalinus clay — a thick, water-tight claystone abundant in the tunneled areas of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is widely regarded as one of the most valuable real-world experiment sites because it provides us with decades of datasets around the interactions of cement and clay, and those are the key materials proposed to be used by countries across the world for engineered barrier systems and geological repositories for nuclear waste,” explains Sarsenbayev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, Sarsenbayev and Wainwright collaborated with co-authors Tournassat and Steefel, who have developed high-performance computing software to improve modeling of interactions between the nuclear waste and both engineered and natural materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, several challenges have limited scientists’ understanding of how nuclear waste reacts with cement-clay barriers. For one thing, the barriers are made up of irregularly mixed materials deep underground. Additionally, the existing class of models commonly used to simulate radionuclide interactions with cement-clay do not take into account electrostatic effects associated with the negatively charged clay minerals in the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tournassat and Steefel’s new software accounts for electrostatic effects, making it the only one that can simulate those interactions in three-dimensional space. The software, called CrunchODiTi, was developed from established software known as CrunchFlow and was most recently updated this year. It is designed to be run on many high-performance computers at once in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers looked at a 13-year-old experiment, with an initial focus on cement-clay rock interactions. Within the last several years, a mix of both negatively and positively charged ions were added to the borehole located near the center of the cement emplaced in the formation. The researchers focused on a 1-centimeter-thick zone between the radionuclides and cement-clay referred to as the “skin.” They compared their experimental results to the software simulation, finding the two datasets aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results are quite significant because previously, these models wouldn’t fit field data very well,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s interesting how fine-scale phenomena at the ‘skin’ between cement and clay, the physical and chemical properties of which changes over time, could be used to reconcile the experimental and simulation data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental results showed the model successfully accounted for electrostatic effects associated with the clay-rich formation and the interaction between materials in Mont Terri over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is all driven by decades of work to understand what happens at these interfaces,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s been hypothesized that there is mineral precipitation and porosity clogging at this interface, and our results strongly suggest that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This application requires millions of degrees of freedom because these multibarrier systems require high resolution and a lot of computational power,” Sarsenbayev says. “This software is really ideal for the Mont Terri experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing waste disposal plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could now replace older models that have been used to conduct safety and performance assessments of underground geological repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. eventually decides to dispose nuclear waste in a geological repository, then these models could dictate the most appropriate materials to use,” Sarsenbayev says. “For instance, right now clay is considered an appropriate storage material, but salt formations are another potential medium that could be used. These models allow us to see the fate of radionuclides over millennia. We can use them to understand interactions at timespans that vary from months to years to many millions of years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarsenbayev says the model is reasonably accessible to other researchers and that future efforts may focus on the use of machine learning to develop less computationally expensive surrogate models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data from the experiment will be available later this month. The team plans to compare those data to additional simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our collaborators will basically get this block of cement and clay, and they’ll be able to run experiments to determine the exact thickness of the skin along with all of the minerals and processes present at this interface,”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sarsenbayev says. “It’s a huge project and it takes time, but we wanted to share initial data and this software as soon as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers hope their study leads to a long-term solution for storing nuclear waste that policymakers and the public can support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interdisciplinary study that includes real world experiments showing we’re able to predict radionuclides’ fate in the subsurface,” Sarsenbayev says. “The motto of MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering is ‘Science. Systems. Society.’ I think this merges all three domains.”&lt;/p&gt;

The search-focused AI startup is rapidly adding millions of users in the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market, positioning itself for mass-market scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This week, Perplexity partnered with Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator after Reliance Jio, to offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription — normally worth $200 — to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. Airtel confirmed to TechCrunch that the deal is exclusive, meaning no other telco in the country can offer Perplexity’s services, including free access, to their subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Airtel partnership is one of Perplexity’s most significant moves yet in a global expansion strategy that includes partnerships with more than 25 telcos globally, including those recently announced with SoftBank in Japan and SK Telecom in South Korea. It comes down to volume. India, the world’s most populous country, brings a mass market that the San Francisco-based startup will not find in other geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity is already gaining major traction in the country. In Q2, Perplexity’s downloads in India surged 600% year-over-year to 2.8 million, according to Sensor Tower data shared exclusively with TechCrunch. In comparison, OpenAI’s ChatGPT saw a 587% increase, reaching 46.7 million downloads in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The growth trend extended to active users as well: Perplexity’s monthly active users (MAUs) in India increased by 640% year-over-year in Q2, while ChatGPT’s MAUs grew by 350%. India was also the largest market by MAUs for Perplexity in the last quarter, per Sensor Tower. However, ChatGPT maintained a significant lead in absolute numbers, with 19.8 million MAUs versus 3.7 million for Perplexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building on earlier partnerships, Perplexity has been working to leverage India’s user base to leapfrog Western markets, where OpenAI dominates paid subscribers. Earlier this year, Perplexity partnered with the Indian fintech giant Paytm to offer access to its AI-powered search through the Paytm app, which has over 500 million downloads and is among the top-three apps on the Indian government’s Unified Payment Interface network, processing over 1.2 billion transactions worth over ₹1,34,000 crores (approximately $15.6 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has also taken direct steps to expand in India. In January, he announced plans to hire an Indian executive in the country, which he later put on hold after receiving an “overwhelming” response. He further announced a $1 million investment and a commitment of five hours a week of his time to a group building AI in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has also internally discussed offering its AI search engine to Indian students to grow its reach, sources told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One reason Perplexity views India as a key growth market is the relatively limited number of local AI startups, particularly in the AI search space. At the same time, the country has a large and active base of tech-savvy users — a fact that has even prompted Perplexity’s archrival, Google, to launch AI-powered search features like AI Mode and AI Overviews in India ahead of many other markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Monetizing that large user base remains a challenge. Perplexity still lags far behind ChatGPT globally in terms of revenue, even as both offer the same $20-per-month starting price. In Q2, ChatGPT’s in-app purchase revenue worldwide surged 731% year-over-year to $773 million, while Perplexity saw a 300% increase, reaching $8 million, per Sensor Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3029032" height="1092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/perplexity-chatgpt-iap.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The revenue challenge is particularly acute in India, where consumers are notoriously price-sensitive. Still, there are promising signs. ChatGPT saw an 800% year-over-year increase in in-app purchases to $9 million in the country in Q2. Perplexity has not generated any notable in-app revenue from India, but the startup has room to expand its paid subscriber base through India. Deals like the one with Airtel could help Perplexity effectively increase its subscriber base, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Strategic partnerships in markets like India could help Perplexity catch the eye of investors who value user growth and geographic diversification. But to turn that attention into long-term backing, the startup will need to show that it can convert its expanding user base into revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Srinivas did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While OpenAI has cemented its lead in the U.S., Perplexity is taking a different route — quietly expanding into India to compete in the next phase of AI adoption.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The revenue challenge is particularly acute in India, where consumers are notoriously price-sensitive. Still, there are promising signs. ChatGPT saw an 800% year-over-year increase in in-app purchases to $9 million in the country in Q2. Perplexity has not generated any notable in-app revenue from India, but the startup has room to expand its paid subscriber base through India. Deals like the one with Airtel could help Perplexity effectively increase its subscriber base, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Strategic partnerships in markets like India could help Perplexity catch the eye of investors who value user growth and geographic diversification. But to turn that attention into long-term backing, the startup will need to show that it can convert its expanding user base into revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

The approach was used to prevent women with genetic mutations from passing mitochondrial diseases to their children. You can read all about the results, and the reception to them, here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But these eight babies aren’t the first “three-parent” children out there. Over the last decade, several teams have been using variations of this approach to help people have babies. This week, let’s consider the &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;babies born from three-person IVF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can’t go any further without talking about the term we use to describe these children.&lt;/strong&gt; Journalists, myself included, have called them “three-parent babies” because they are created using DNA from three people. Briefly, the approach typically involves using the DNA from the nuclei of the intended parents’ egg and sperm cells. That’s where most of the DNA in a cell is found.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it also makes use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)—the DNA found in the energy-producing organelles of a cell—from a third person. The idea is to avoid using the mtDNA from the intended mother, perhaps because it is carrying genetic mutations. Other teams have done this in the hope of treating infertility.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;mtDNA, which is usually inherited from a person’s mother, makes up a tiny fraction of total inherited DNA. It includes only 37 genes, all of which are thought to play a role in how mitochondria work (as opposed to, say, eye color or height).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why some scientists despise the term “three-parent baby.”&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the baby has DNA from three people, but those three can’t all be considered &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt;, critics argue. For the sake of argument, this time around I’ll use the term “three-person IVF” from here on out.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So, about these babies. The first were reported back in the 1990s. Jacques Cohen, then at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, and his colleagues thought they might be able to treat some cases of infertility by injecting the mitochondria-containing cytoplasm of healthy eggs into eggs from the intended mother.&amp;nbsp;Seventeen babies were ultimately born this way, according to the team. (Side note: In&amp;nbsp;their paper, the authors describe potential resulting children as “three-parental individuals.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But two fetuses appeared to have genetic abnormalities. And one of the children started to show signs of a developmental disorder. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration put a stop to the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The babies born during that study&amp;nbsp;are in their 20s now. But scientists still don’t know why they saw those abnormalities. Some think that mixing mtDNA from two people might be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newer approaches to three-person IVF aim to include mtDNA from just the donor, completely bypassing the intended mother’s mtDNA.&lt;/strong&gt; John Zhang at the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City tried this approach for a Jordanian couple in 2016. The woman carried genes for a fatal mitochondrial disease and had already lost two children to it. She wanted to avoid passing it on to another child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang took the nucleus of the woman’s egg and inserted it into a donor egg that had had its own nucleus removed—but still had its mitochondria-containing cytoplasm. That egg was then fertilized with the woman’s husband’s sperm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because it was still illegal in the US, Zhang controversially did the procedure in Mexico, &lt;/strong&gt;where,&amp;nbsp;as he told me at the time, “there are no rules.” The couple eventually welcomed a healthy baby boy. Less than 1% of the boy’s mitochondria carried his mother’s mutation, so the procedure was deemed a success.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was a fair bit of outrage from the scientific community, though. Mitochondrial donation had been made legal in the UK the previous year, but no clinic had yet been given a license to do it. Zhang’s experiment seemed to have been conducted with no oversight. Many questioned how ethical it was, although Sian Harding, who reviewed the ethics of the UK procedure, then told me it was “as good as or better than what we’ll do in the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scandal had barely died down by the time the next “three-person IVF” babies were announced.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2017, a team at the Nadiya Clinic in Ukraine&amp;nbsp;announced the birth of a little girl to parents who’d had the treatment for infertility. The news brought more outrage from some quarters, as scientists argued that the experimental procedure should only be used to prevent severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until later that year that the UK’s fertility authority granted a team in Newcastle a license to perform mitochondrial donation. That team launched a trial in 2017. It was big news—the first “official” trial to test whether the approach could safely prevent mitochondrial disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it was slow going.&lt;/strong&gt; And meanwhile, other teams were making progress. The Nadiya Clinic continued to trial the procedure in couples with infertility. Pavlo Mazur, a former embryologist who worked at that clinic, tells me that 10 babies were born there as a result of mitochondrial donation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mazur then moved to another clinic in Ukraine, where he says he used a different type of mitochondrial donation to achieve another five healthy births for people with infertility. “In total, it’s 15 kids made by me,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he adds that other clinics in Ukraine are also using mitochondrial donation, without sharing their results. “We don’t know the actual number of those kids in Ukraine,” says Mazur. “But there are dozens of them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2020, Nuno Costa-Borges of Embryotools in Barcelona, Spain, and his colleagues described&amp;nbsp;another trial of mitochondrial donation.&lt;/strong&gt; This trial, performed in Greece, was also designed to test the procedure for people with infertility. It involved 25 patients. So far,&amp;nbsp;seven children have been born. “I think it’s a bit strange that they aren’t getting more credit,” says Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The newly announced UK births are only the latest “three-person IVF” babies. And while their births are being heralded as a success story for mitochondrial donation, the story isn’t quite so simple. Three of the eight babies were born with a non-insignificant proportion of mutated mitochondria, ranging between 5% and 20%, depending on the baby and the sample.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dagan Wells of the University of Oxford, who is involved in the Greece trial, says that two of the seven babies in their study also appear to have inherited mtDNA from their intended mothers. Mazur says he has seen several cases of this “reversal” too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t a problem for babies whose mothers don’t carry genes for mitochondrial disease.&lt;/strong&gt; But it might be for those whose mothers do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to pour cold water over the new UK results. It was great to finally see the results of a trial that’s been running for eight years. And the births of healthy babies are something to celebrate. But it’s not a simple success story. Mitochondrial donation doesn’t guarantee a healthy baby. We still have more to learn, not only from these babies, but from the others that have already been born.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

 &lt;p&gt;This week we heard that eight babies have been born in the UK following an experimental form of IVF that involves DNA from three people. The approach was used to prevent women with genetic mutations from passing mitochondrial diseases to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these eight babies aren’t the first “three-parent” children out there. Over the last decade, several teams have been using variations of this approach to help people have babies. But the procedure is not without controversy.

On Thursday, Netflix said that it has started using AI in movies and shows it produces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking at the company’s post-results conference call, the company’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that the platform had “the very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen” in an Argentine show called “El Atonata.” He noted that Netflix’s internal production group teamed up with producers to use AI to create a scene of a building collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sarandos said that using AI, the scene was finished 10 times faster than it would have with traditional visual effect tools, and that it cost less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper. There are AI-powered creator tools. So this is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot-planning work, and certainly visual effects. It used to be that only big-budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging,” he said during the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-CEO Greg Peters said Netflix is using gen AI in other areas as well, including personalization, search and ads, and that the company aims to roll out interactive ads in the second half of this year. Earlier this year, the company rolled out AI-powered search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the second quarter, Netflix reported revenue of $11.08 billion, up 16% from a year earlier, and profit of $3.13 billion.
