The industry’s focus is shifting toward agents—systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and negotiate on users’ behalf. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what would happen if both a customer and a seller were using an AI agent? A recent study put agent-to-agent negotiations to the test and found that stronger agents can exploit weaker ones to get a better deal. It’s a bit like entering court with a seasoned attorney versus a rookie: You’re technically playing the same game, but the odds are skewed from the start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The paper, posted to arXiv’s preprint site, found that access to more advanced AI models —those with greater reasoning ability, better training data, and more parameters—could lead to consistently better financial deals, potentially widening the gap between people with greater resources and technical access and those without. If agent-to-agent interactions become the norm, disparities in AI capabilities could quietly deepen existing inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Over time, this could create a digital divide where your financial outcomes are shaped less by your negotiating skill and more by the strength of your AI proxy,” says Jiaxin Pei, a postdoc researcher at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their experiment, the researchers had AI models play the roles of buyers and sellers in three scenarios, negotiating deals for electronics, motor vehicles, and real estate. Each seller agent received the product’s specs, wholesale cost, and retail price, with instructions to maximize profit. Buyer agents, in contrast, were given a budget, the retail price, and ideal product requirements and were tasked with driving the price down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each agent had some, but not all, relevant details. This setup mimics many real-world negotiation conditions, where parties lack full visibility into each other’s constraints or objectives.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The differences in performance were striking. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-o3 delivered the strongest overall negotiation results, followed by the company’s GPT-4.1 and o4-mini. GPT-3.5, which came out almost two years earlier and is the oldest model included in the study,&amp;nbsp; lagged significantly in both roles—it made the least money as the seller and spent the most as a buyer. DeepSeek R1 and V3 also performed well, particularly as sellers. Qwen2.5 trailed behind, though it showed more strength in the buyer role.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable pattern was that some agents often failed to close deals but effectively maximize profit in the sales they did make, while others completed more negotiations but settled for lower margins. GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1 struck the best balance, achieving both solid profits and high completion rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond financial losses, the researchers found that AI agents could get stuck in prolonged negotiation loops without reaching an agreement—or end talks prematurely, even when instructed to push for the best possible deal. Even the most capable models were prone to these failures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The result was very surprising to us,” says Pei. “We all believe LLMs are pretty good these days, but they can be untrustworthy in high-stakes scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disparity in negotiation performance could be caused by a number of factors, says Pei. These include differences in training data and the models’ ability to reason and infer missing information. The precise causes remain uncertain, but one factor seems clear: Model size plays a significant role. According to the scaling laws of large language models, capabilities tend to improve with an increase in the number of parameters. This trend held true in the study: Even within the same model family, larger models were consistently able to strike better deals as both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is part of a growing body of research warning about the risks of deploying AI agents in real-world financial decision-making. Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their risk profiles, not just their peak performance. Current benchmarks, they say, emphasize accuracy and return-based metrics, which measure how well an agent can perform at its best but overlook how safely it can fail. Their research also found that even top-performing models are more likely to break down under adversarial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The team suggests that in the context of real-world finances, a tiny weakness—even a 1% failure rate—could expose the system to systemic risks. They recommend that AI agents be “stress tested” before being put into practical use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hancheng Cao, an incoming assistant professor at Emory University, notes that the price negotiation study has limitations. “The experiments were conducted in simulated environments that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world negotiations or user behavior,” says Cao.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Pei, the researcher, says researchers and industry practitioners are experimenting with a variety of strategies to reduce these risks. These include refining the prompts given to AI agents, enabling agents to use external tools or code to make better decisions, coordinating multiple models to double-check each other’s work, and fine-tuning models on domain-specific financial data—all of which have shown promise in improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many prominent AI shopping tools are currently limited to product recommendation. In April, for example, Amazon launched “Buy for Me,” an AI agent that helps customers find and buy products from other brands’ sites if Amazon doesn’t sell them directly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While price negotiation is rare in consumer e-commerce, it’s more common in business-to-business transactions. Alibaba.com has rolled out a sourcing assistant called Accio, built on its open-source Qwen models, that helps businesses find suppliers and research products. The company told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; it has no plans to automate price bargaining so far, citing high risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That may be a wise move. For now, Pei advises consumers to treat AI shopping assistants as helpful tools—not stand-ins for humans in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we are fully ready to delegate our decisions to AI shopping agents,” he says. “So maybe just use it as an information tool, not a negotiator.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: We removed a line about agent deployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/handshake.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The race to build ever larger AI models is slowing down.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in February, I flew to Amsterdam to report on a high-stakes experiment the city had recently conducted: a pilot program for what it called Smart Check, which was its attempt to create an effective, fair, and unbiased predictive algorithm to try to detect welfare fraud. But the city fell short of its lofty goals—and, with our partners at Lighthouse Reports and the Dutch newspaper &lt;em&gt;Trouw&lt;/em&gt;, we tried to get to the bottom of why. You can read about it in our deep dive published last week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For an American reporter, it’s been an interesting time to write a story on “responsible AI” in a progressive European city—just as ethical considerations in AI deployments appear to be disappearing in the United States, at least at the national level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a few weeks before my trip, the Trump administration rescinded Biden’s executive order on AI safety and DOGE began turning to AI to decide which federal programs to cut. Then, more recently, House Republicans passed a 10-year moratorium on US states’ ability to regulate AI (though it has yet to be passed by the Senate).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What all this points to is a new reality in the United States where responsible AI is no longer a priority (if it ever genuinely was).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Amsterdam’s welfare department began developing the algorithm that became Smart Check, the municipality followed virtually every recommendation in the responsible-AI playbook: consulting external experts, running bias tests, implementing technical safeguards, and seeking stakeholder feedback. City officials hoped the resulting algorithm could avoid causing the worst types of harm inflicted by discriminatory AI over nearly a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After talking to a large number of people involved in the project and others who would potentially be affected by it, as well as some experts who did not work on it, it’s hard not to wonder if the city could ever have succeeded in its goals when neither “fairness” nor even “bias” has a universally agreed-upon definition. &lt;strong&gt;The city was treating these issues as technical ones that could be answered by reweighting numbers and figures—rather than political and philosophical questions that society as a whole has to grapple with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the afternoon that I arrived in Amsterdam, I sat down with Anke van der Vliet, a longtime advocate for welfare beneficiaries who served on what’s called the Participation Council, a 15-member citizen body that represents benefits recipients and their advocates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The city had consulted the council during Smart Check’s development, but van der Vliet was blunt in sharing the committee’s criticisms of the plans. Its members simply didn’t want the program. They had well-placed fears of discrimination and disproportionate impact, given that fraud is found in only 3% of applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the city’s credit, it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; respond to some of their concerns and make changes in the algorithm’s design—like removing from consideration factors, such as age, whose inclusion could have had a discriminatory impact. But the city ignored the Participation Council’s main feedback: its recommendation to stop development altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Vliet and other welfare advocates I met on my trip, like representatives from the Amsterdam Welfare Union, described what they see as a number of challenges faced by the city’s some 35,000 benefits recipients: the indignities of having to constantly re-prove the need for benefits, the increases in cost of living that benefits payments do not reflect, and the general feeling of distrust between recipients and the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;City welfare officials themselves recognize the flaws of the system, which “is held together by rubber bands and staples,” as Harry Bodaar, a senior policy advisor to the city who focuses on welfare fraud enforcement, told us. “And if you’re at the bottom of that system, you’re the first to fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the Participation Council didn’t want Smart Check at all, even as Bodaar and others working in the department hoped that it could fix the system. It’s a classic example of a “wicked problem,” a social or cultural issue with no one clear answer and many potential consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the story was published, I heard from Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a former tech advisor to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-wrote Biden’s AI Bill of Rights (now rescinded by Trump). “We need participation early on from communities,” he said, but he added that it also matters what officials do with the feedback—and whether there is “a willingness to reframe the intervention based on what people actually want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had the city started with a different question—what people actually want—perhaps it might have developed a different algorithm entirely.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Dutch digital rights advocate Hans De Zwart put it to us, “We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems … why doesn’t the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of fundamental questions AI developers will need to consider, or they run the risk of repeating (or ignoring) the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Venkatasubramanian told me he found the story to be “affirming” in highlighting the need for “those in charge of governing these systems”&amp;nbsp; to “ask hard questions … starting with whether they should be used at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he also called the story “humbling”: “Even with good intentions, and a desire to benefit from all the research on responsible AI, it’s still possible to build systems that are fundamentally flawed, for reasons that go well beyond the details of the system constructions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To better understand this debate, read our full story here. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you want more detail on how we ran our own bias tests after the city gave us unprecedented access to the Smart Check algorithm, check out the methodology over at Lighthouse.

Then, more recently, House Republicans passed a 10-year moratorium on US states’ ability to regulate AI (though it has yet to be passed by the Senate).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What all this points to is a new reality in the United States where responsible AI is no longer a priority (if it ever genuinely was).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Amsterdam’s welfare department began developing the algorithm that became Smart Check, the municipality followed virtually every recommendation in the responsible-AI playbook: consulting external experts, running bias tests, implementing technical safeguards, and seeking stakeholder feedback. City officials hoped the resulting algorithm could avoid causing the worst types of harm inflicted by discriminatory AI over nearly a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After talking to a large number of people involved in the project and others who would potentially be affected by it, as well as some experts who did not work on it, it’s hard not to wonder if the city could ever have succeeded in its goals when neither “fairness” nor even “bias” has a universally agreed-upon definition. &lt;strong&gt;The city was treating these issues as technical ones that could be answered by reweighting numbers and figures—rather than political and philosophical questions that society as a whole has to grapple with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the afternoon that I arrived in Amsterdam, I sat down with Anke van der Vliet, a longtime advocate for welfare beneficiaries who served on what’s called the Participation Council, a 15-member citizen body that represents benefits recipients and their advocates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The city had consulted the council during Smart Check’s development, but van der Vliet was blunt in sharing the committee’s criticisms of the plans. Its members simply didn’t want the program. They had well-placed fears of discrimination and disproportionate impact, given that fraud is found in only 3% of applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the city’s credit, it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; respond to some of their concerns and make changes in the algorithm’s design—like removing from consideration factors, such as age, whose inclusion could have had a discriminatory impact. But the city ignored the Participation Council’s main feedback: its recommendation to stop development altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Vliet and other welfare advocates I met on my trip, like representatives from the Amsterdam Welfare Union, described what they see as a number of challenges faced by the city’s some 35,000 benefits recipients: the indignities of having to constantly re-prove the need for benefits, the increases in cost of living that benefits payments do not reflect, and the general feeling of distrust between recipients and the government.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;City welfare officials themselves recognize the flaws of the system, which “is held together by rubber bands and staples,” as Harry Bodaar, a senior policy advisor to the city who focuses on welfare fraud enforcement, told us. “And if you’re at the bottom of that system, you’re the first to fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the Participation Council didn’t want Smart Check at all, even as Bodaar and others working in the department hoped that it could fix the system. It’s a classic example of a “wicked problem,” a social or cultural issue with no one clear answer and many potential consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the story was published, I heard from Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a former tech advisor to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-wrote Biden’s AI Bill of Rights (now rescinded by Trump). “We need participation early on from communities,” he said, but he added that it also matters what officials do with the feedback—and whether there is “a willingness to reframe the intervention based on what people actually want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had the city started with a different question—what people actually want—perhaps it might have developed a different algorithm entirely.&lt;/strong&gt; As the Dutch digital rights advocate Hans De Zwart put it to us, “We are being seduced by technological solutions for the wrong problems … why doesn’t the municipality build an algorithm that searches for people who do not apply for social assistance but are entitled to it?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of fundamental questions AI developers will need to consider, or they run the risk of repeating (or ignoring) the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Venkatasubramanian told me he found the story to be “affirming” in highlighting the need for “those in charge of governing these systems”&amp;nbsp; to “ask hard questions … starting with whether they should be used at all.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But he also called the story “humbling”: “Even with good intentions, and a desire to benefit from all the research on responsible AI, it’s still possible to build systems that are fundamentally flawed, for reasons that go well beyond the details of the system constructions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To better understand this debate, read our full story here. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you want more detail on how we ran our own bias tests after the city gave us unprecedented access to the Smart Check algorithm, check out the methodology over at Lighthouse.

A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Suárez Vázquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing—a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico’s ubiquitous coquí frog. It’s in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn’t know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes’ drive down the road is Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile—towering more than 12 stories high—out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has signed a new law rolling back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 2000—before the coal plant opened—Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico’s central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209—a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the “operation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company” as “a case of environmental injustice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Seemingly everyone Suárez Vázquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who’s sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“In one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,” she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo’s face was printed. “It’s disgraceful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down—as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118414" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF6381.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Carmen Suárez Vázquez clutches a pillow with a portraits of her daughter and late son Edgardo. When this photograph was taken, she had just been released from the hospital, where she underwent treatment for lung inflammation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER C. KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suárez Vázquez had hoped that relief would be on the way by now. That the billions of dollars Congress designated for fixing the island’s infrastructure would have made solar panels ubiquitous. That AES’s coal plant, which for nearly a quarter century has supplied up to 20% of the old, faulty electrical grid’s power, would be near its end—its closure had been set for late 2027. That the Caribbean’s first virtual power plant—a decentralized network of solar panels and batteries that could be remotely tapped into and used to balance the grid like a centralized fuel-burning station—would be well on its way to establishing a new model for the troubled island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico’s power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer González-Colón serving as Puerto Rico’s governor, America’s largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico’s lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, González-Colón issued an executive order fast-­tracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for “practical fixes and emergency activities” to improve the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico’s grid before what’s forecast to be a hotter-than-­average summer—and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory’s elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory’s state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April González-Colón moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118416" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8754.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Alberto Colón, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, helped install her solar panels.

KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="close up of a hand holding a paper towel with a gritty black streak on it" class="wp-image-1118415" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8747.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Colón shows some of the soot wiped from the side of his house.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ALEXANDER C. KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, she’s trying to enforce a separate contract with New Fortress Energy, the New York–based natural-gas company that gained control of Puerto Rico’s state-owned power plants in a hotly criticized privatization deal in 2023—all while the company is pushing to build more gas-fired generating stations to increase the island’s demand for liquefied natural gas. Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico—despite the company’s failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers’ lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory’s finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters’ ability to steer their own fate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AES declined an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for González-Colón responded to repeated requests for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was born on Puerto Rico’s Emancipation Day, but I’m not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,” says Alberto Colón, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. “I have sinus problems, and I’m lucky. My wife has many, many health problems. It’s gotten really bad in the last few years. Even with screens in the windows, the dust gets into the house.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt—a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don’t have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don’t typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don’t benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government—the US federal government—that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A phrase that’s ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: &lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia—&lt;/em&gt;the problem is the colony.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world’s oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called “the white man’s burden”—the duty to civilize his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal had modernized the island’s infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer’s plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island’s middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the “belle of the bond markets.” By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-­owned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a “possession” of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature—in which the island’s elected delegate had no vote—to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act—shortened to PROMESA, or “promise” in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island’s elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island’s autonomy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,” Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another “colonial experiment.” “The democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected ‘with all deliberate speed.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-­destroying electrical surges were distressingly common.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The spotty service wasn’t the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico’s great blackout. The fiscal control board—which critics pejoratively referred to as “la junta,” using a term typically reserved for Latin America’s most notorious military dictatorships—saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy—a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO—to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A deadly diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until that point, life was looking up for Suárez Vázquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They were courting him,” Suárez Vázquez says. “He was going to graduate with a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo’s case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ewing’s sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had—extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone—is even rarer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, there’s scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found “no well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,” researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to “small, retrospective, case-control studies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dependable sun&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The push to give control over the territory’s power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn’t lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island’s residents. Last year, when the Biden administration’s Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="worker crouching on a roof to install solar panels" class="wp-image-1118412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21309469874938.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 have enrolled in a pilot project aimed at providing backup power to the grid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GDA VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico’s energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board’s lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created “a precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.” In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging “the importance of developing renewable energy projects.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau “negotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices” on a handful of projects, says Javier Rúa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar &amp;amp; Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “Then the fiscal board—in my opinion arbitrarily—canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government’s local experts will be final. “There’s no trust,” says Rúa-Jovet. “That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing “deep structural inefficiencies” that “ultimately delayed progress” toward Puerto Rico’s renewables goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, Rúa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts—eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The share of renewables on Puerto Rico’s power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress’s request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,” says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She’d be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on “smaller-­scale natural-gas plants” that could be used to back up renewables, but “what they’re talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.” She says, “That’s just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn’t require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avilés-Ríos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,” she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. “The pollution impact alone would be horrible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months—but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they’d pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico’s contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden’s senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the “troubling” fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run—disincentivizing any transition to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Territories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,” she told me. “The Trump administration’s emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-­energy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico’s other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Puerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant’s generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can’t turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,” Rúa-Jovet says. “That’s just a physical fact.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lowest-cost energy, depending on who’s paying the price&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island’s bondholders. “From a bondholder perspective, [it’s] the lowest cost,” she explains. “From the client and user perspective, it’s the lowest cost. It’s always been the cheapest form of energy down there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy,” says Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez. He says he’s had cancer twice already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, “the government ends up paying the expense of people’s asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old.&amp;nbsp;“So many people have died,” Suárez Vázquez told me, choking back tears. “They contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black. My son’s insides were black. This never ends.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118413" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25107124641123.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Customers sit inside a restaurant lit by battery-powered lanterns. On April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AP PHOTO/ALEJANDRO GRANADILLO&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor do the blackouts. At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico’s central mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Come to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,” the group beckoned, “where we have electricity and internet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander C.

A feral pig roams the neighborhood, trailed by her bumbling piglets. Bougainvillea blossoms ring brightly painted houses soaked in Caribbean sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet fine particles of black dust coat the windowpanes and the leaves of the blooming vines. Because of this, Suárez Vázquez feels she is stalked by death. The dust is in the air, so she seals her windows with plastic to reduce the time she spends wheezing—a sound that has grown as natural in this place as the whistling croak of Puerto Rico’s ubiquitous coquí frog. It’s in the taps, so a watercooler and extra bottles take up prime real estate in her kitchen. She doesn’t know exactly how the coal pollution got there, but she is certain it ended up in her youngest son, Edgardo, who died of a rare form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And she believes she knows where it came from. Just a few minutes’ drive down the road is Puerto Rico’s only coal-fired power station, flanked by a mountain of toxic ash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution. During Hurricane Maria in 2017, powerful winds and rain swept the unsecured pile—towering more than 12 stories high—out into the ocean and the surrounding area. Though the company had moved millions of tons of ash around Puerto Rico to be used in construction and landfill, much of it had stayed in Guayama, according to a 2018 investigation by the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, a nonprofit investigative newsroom. Last October, AES settled with the US Environmental Protection Agency over alleged violations of groundwater rules, including failure to properly monitor wells and notify the public about significant pollution levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has signed a new law rolling back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goal of 40% renewables by 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 2000—before the coal plant opened—Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data in Puerto Rico’s central cancer registry, cases hit a new high of 209—a more than 88% increase from the year AES started burning coal. A study by University of Puerto Rico researchers found cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses on the rise in the area. They suggested that proximity to the coal plant may be to blame, describing the “operation, emissions, and handling of coal ash from the company” as “a case of environmental injustice.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Seemingly everyone Suárez Vázquez knows has some kind of health problem. Nearly every house on her street has someone who’s sick, she told me. Her best friend, who grew up down the block, died of cancer a year ago, aged 55. Her mother has survived 15 heart attacks. Her own lungs are so damaged she requires a breathing machine to sleep at night, and she was forced to quit her job at a nearby pharmaceutical factory because she could no longer make it up and down the stairs without gasping for air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we met in her living room one sunny March afternoon, she had just returned from two weeks in the hospital, where doctors were treating her for lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“In one community, we have so many cases of cancer, respiratory problems, and heart disease,” she said, her voice cracking as tears filled her eyes and she clutched a pillow on which a photo of Edgardo’s face was printed. “It’s disgraceful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neighbors have helped her install solar panels and batteries on the roof of her home, helping to offset the cost of running her air conditioner, purifier, and breathing machine. They also allow the devices to operate even when the grid goes down—as it still does multiple times a week, nearly eight years after Hurricane Maria laid waste to Puerto Rico’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118414" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF6381.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Carmen Suárez Vázquez clutches a pillow with a portraits of her daughter and late son Edgardo.

KAUFMAN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suárez Vázquez had hoped that relief would be on the way by now. That the billions of dollars Congress designated for fixing the island’s infrastructure would have made solar panels ubiquitous. That AES’s coal plant, which for nearly a quarter century has supplied up to 20% of the old, faulty electrical grid’s power, would be near its end—its closure had been set for late 2027. That the Caribbean’s first virtual power plant—a decentralized network of solar panels and batteries that could be remotely tapped into and used to balance the grid like a centralized fuel-burning station—would be well on its way to establishing a new model for the troubled island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico once seemed to be on that path. In 2019, two years after Hurricane Maria sent the island into the second-longest blackout in world history, the Puerto Rican government set out to make its energy system cheaper, more resilient, and less dependent on imported fossil fuels, passing a law that set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2050. Under the Biden administration, a gas company took charge of Puerto Rico’s power plants and started importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), while the federal government funded major new solar farms and programs to install panels and batteries on rooftops across the island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Donald Trump back in the White House and his close ally Jenniffer González-Colón serving as Puerto Rico’s governor, America’s largest unincorporated territory is on track for a fossil-fuel resurgence. The island quietly approved a new gas power plant in 2024, and earlier this year it laid out plans for a second one. Arguing that it was the only way to avoid massive blackouts, the governor signed legislation to keep Puerto Rico’s lone coal plant open for at least another seven years and potentially more. The new law also rolls back the island’s clean-energy statute, completely eliminating its initial goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 60% by 2040, though it preserves the goal of reaching 100% by 2050. At the start of April, González-Colón issued an executive order fast-­tracking permits for new fossil-fuel plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In May the new US energy secretary, Chris Wright, redirected $365 million in federal funds the Biden administration had committed to solar panels and batteries to instead pay for “practical fixes and emergency activities” to improve the grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all part of a desperate effort to shore up Puerto Rico’s grid before what’s forecast to be a hotter-than-­average summer—and highlights the thorny bramble of bureaucracy and business deals that prevents the territory’s elected government from making progress on the most basic demand from voters to restore some semblance of modern American living standards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Ricans already pay higher electricity prices than most other American citizens, and Luma Energy, the private company put in charge of selling and distributing power from the territory’s state-owned generating stations four years ago, keeps raising rates despite ongoing outages. In April González-Colón moved to crack down on Luma, whose contract she pledged to cancel on the campaign trail, though it remains unclear how she will find a suitable replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118416" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8754.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Alberto Colón, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, helped install her solar panels.

Just weeks before the coal plant won its extension, New Fortress secured a deal to sell even more LNG to Puerto Rico—despite the company’s failure to win federal permits for a controversial import terminal in San Juan Bay, already in operation, that critics fear puts the most densely populated part of the island at major risk, with no real plan for what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those contracts infamously offered Luma and New Fortress plenty of carrots in the form of decades-long deals and access to billions of dollars in federal reconstruction money, but few sticks the Puerto Rican government could wield against them when ratepayers’ lights went out and prices went up. In a sign of how dim the prospects for improvement look, New Fortress even opted in March to forgo nearly $1 billion in performance bonuses over the next decade in favor of getting $110 million in cash up front. Spending any money to fix the problems Puerto Rico faces, meanwhile, requires approval from an unelected fiscal control board that Congress put in charge of the territory’s finances during a government debt crisis nearly a decade ago, further reducing voters’ ability to steer their own fate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AES declined an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; and did not respond to a detailed list of emailed questions. Neither New Fortress nor a spokesperson for González-Colón responded to repeated requests for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was born on Puerto Rico’s Emancipation Day, but I’m not liberated because that coal plant is still operating,” says Alberto Colón, 75, a retired public school administrator who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez, referring to the holiday that celebrates the abolition of slavery in what was then a Spanish colony. “I have sinus problems, and I’m lucky. My wife has many, many health problems. It’s gotten really bad in the last few years. Even with screens in the windows, the dust gets into the house.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question for anyone who visits this place and tries to understand why things are the way they are is: How did it get this bad?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The complicated answer is a story about colonialism, corruption, and the challenges of rebuilding an island that was smothered by debt—a direct consequence of federal policy changes in the 1990s. Although they are citizens, Puerto Ricans don’t have votes that count in US presidential elections. They don’t typically pay US federal income taxes, but they also don’t benefit fully from federal programs, receiving capped block grants that frequently run out. Today the island has even less control over its fate than in years past and is entirely beholden to a government—the US federal government—that its 3.2 million citizens had no part in choosing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s happening today in Puerto Rico began long before Hurricane Maria made landfall over the territory, mangling its aging power lines like a metal Slinky in a blender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A phrase that’s ubiquitous in graffiti on transmission poles and concrete walls in the towns around Guayama and in the artsy parts of San Juan places the blame deep in history: &lt;em&gt;El problema es la colonia—&lt;/em&gt;the problem is the colony.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By some measures, Puerto Rico is the world’s oldest colony, officially established under the Spanish crown in 1508. The US seized the island as a trophy in 1898 following its victory in the Spanish-American War. In the grips of an expansionist quest to place itself on par with European empires, Washington pried Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines away from Madrid, granting each territory the same status then afforded to the newly annexed formerly independent kingdom of Hawaii. Acolytes of President William McKinley saw themselves as accepting what the Indian-born British poet Rudyard Kipling called “the white man’s burden”—the duty to civilize his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although direct military rule lasted just two years, Puerto Ricans had virtually no say over the civil government that came to power in 1900, in which the White House appointed the governor. That explicitly colonial arrangement ended only in 1948 with the first island-wide elections for governor. Even then, the US instituted a gag law just months before the election that would remain in effect for nearly a decade, making agitation for independence illegal. Still, the following decades were a period of relative prosperity for Puerto Rico. Money from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal had modernized the island’s infrastructure, and rural farmers flocked to bustling cities like Ponce and San Juan for jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing sector. The pharmaceutical industry in particular became a major employer. By the start of the 21st century, Pfizer’s plant in the Puerto Rican town of Barceloneta was the largest Viagra manufacturer in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in 1996, Republicans in Congress struck a deal with President Bill Clinton to phase out federal tax breaks that had helped draw those manufacturers to Puerto Rico. As factories closed, the jobs that had built up the island’s middle class disappeared. To compensate, the government hired more workers as teachers and police officers, borrowing money on the bond market to pay their salaries and make up for the drop in local tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s territorial status meant it could not legally declare bankruptcy, and lenders assumed the island enjoyed the full backing of the US Treasury. Before long, it was known on Wall Street as the “belle of the bond markets.” By the mid-2010s, however, the bond debt had grown to $74 billion, and a $49 billion chasm had opened between the amount the government needed to pay public pensions and the money it had available. It began shedding more and more of its payroll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the government-­owned utility, had racked up $9 billion in debt. Unlike US states, which can buy electricity from neighboring grids and benefit from interstate gas pipelines, Puerto Rico needed to import fuel to run its power plants. The majority of that power came from burning oil, since petroleum was easier to store for long periods of time. But oil, and diesel in particular, was expensive and pushed the utility further and further into the red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2016, Puerto Rico could no longer afford to pay its bills. Since the law that gave the US jurisdiction over nonstate territories made Puerto Rico a “possession” of Congress, it fell on the federal legislature—in which the island’s elected delegate had no vote—to decide what to do. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act—shortened to PROMESA, or “promise” in Spanish. It established a fiscal control board appointed by the White House, with veto power over all spending by the island’s elected government. The board had authority over how the money the territorial government collected in taxes and utility bills could be used. It was a significant shift in the island’s autonomy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The United States cannot continue its state of denial by failing to accept that its relationship with its citizens who reside in Puerto Rico is an egregious violation of their civil rights,” Juan R. Torruella, the late federal appeals court judge, wrote in a landmark paper in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, excoriating the legislation as yet another “colonial experiment.” “The democratic deficits inherent in this relationship cast doubt on its legitimacy, and require that it be frontally attacked and corrected ‘with all deliberate speed.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Hurricane Maria struck a little over a year after PROMESA passed, and according to official figures, killed dozens. That proved to be just the start, however. As months ground on without any electricity and more people were forced to go without medicine or clean water, the death toll rose to the thousands. It would be 11 months before the grid would be fully restored, and even then, outages and appliance-­destroying electrical surges were distressingly common.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The spotty service wasn’t the only defining characteristic of the new era after Puerto Rico’s great blackout. The fiscal control board—which critics pejoratively referred to as “la junta,” using a term typically reserved for Latin America’s most notorious military dictatorships—saw privatization as the best path to solvency for the troubled state utility.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 2020, the board approved a deal for Luma Energy—a joint venture between Quanta Services, a Texas-based energy infrastructure company, and its Canadian rival ATCO—to take over the distribution and sale of electricity in Puerto Rico. The contract was awarded through a process that clean-energy and anticorruption advocates said lacked transparency and delivered an agreement with few penalties for poor service. It was almost immediately mired in controversy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A deadly diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until that point, life was looking up for Suárez Vázquez. Her family had emerged from the aftermath of Maria without any loss of life. In 2019, her children were out of the house, and her youngest son, Edgardo, was studying at an aviation school in Ceiba, roughly two hours northeast of Guayama. He excelled. During regular health checks at the school, Edgardo was deemed fit. Gift bags started showing up at the house from American Airlines and JetBlue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They were courting him,” Suárez Vázquez says. “He was going to graduate with a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That summer of 2019, however, Edgardo began complaining of abdominal pain. He ignored it for a few months but promised his mother he would go to the doctor to get it checked out. On September 23, she got a call from her godson, a radiologist at the hospital. Not wanting to burden his anxious mother, Edgardo had gone to the hospital alone at 3 a.m., and tests had revealed three tumors entwined in his intestines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So began a two-year battle with a form of cancer so rare that doctors said Edgardo’s case was one of only a few hundred worldwide. He gave up on flight school and took a job at the pharmaceutical factory with his parents. Coworkers raised money to help the family afford flights and stays to see specialists in other parts of Puerto Rico and then in Florida. Edgardo suspected the cause was something in the water. Doctors gave him inconclusive answers; they just wanted to study him to understand the unusual tumors. He got water-testing kits and discovered that the taps in their home were laden with high amounts of heavy metals typically found in coal ash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ewing’s sarcoma tumors occur at a rate of about one in one million cancer diagnoses in the US each year. What Edgardo had—extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma, in which tumors form in soft tissue rather than bone—is even rarer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, there’s scant research on what causes that kind of cancer. While the National Institutes of Health have found “no well-established association between Ewing sarcoma and environmental risk factors,” researchers cautioned in a 2024 paper that findings have been limited to “small, retrospective, case-control studies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dependable sun&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The push to give control over the territory’s power system to private companies with fossil-fuel interests ignored the reality that for many Puerto Ricans, rooftop solar panels and batteries were among the most dependable options for generating power after the hurricane. Solar power was relatively affordable, especially as Luma jacked up what were already some of the highest electricity rates in the US. It also didn’t lead to sudden surges that fried refrigerators and microwaves. Its output was as predictable as Caribbean sunshine.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But rooftop panels could generate only so much electricity for the island’s residents. Last year, when the Biden administration’s Department of Energy conducted its PR100 study into how Puerto Rico could meet its legally mandated goals of 100% renewable power by the middle of the century, the research showed that the bulk of the work would need to be done by big, utility-scale solar farms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="worker crouching on a roof to install solar panels" class="wp-image-1118412" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21309469874938.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 have enrolled in a pilot project aimed at providing backup power to the grid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;GDA VIA AP IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;With its flat lands once used to grow sugarcane, the southeastern part of Puerto Rico proved perfect for devoting acres to solar production. Several enormous solar farms with enough panels to generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity were planned for the area, including one owned by AES. But early efforts to get the projects off the ground stumbled once the fiscal oversight board got involved. The solar farms that Puerto Rico’s energy regulators approved ultimately faced rejection by federal overseers who complained that the panels in areas near Guayama could be built even more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a September 2023 letter to PREPA vetoing the projects, the oversight board’s lawyer chastised the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, a government regulatory body whose five commissioners are appointed by the governor, for allowing the solar developers to update contracts to account for surging costs from inflation that year. It was said to have created “a precedent that bids will be renegotiated, distorting market pricing and creating litigation risk.” In another letter to PREPA, in January 2024, the board agreed to allow projects generating up to 150 megawatts of power to move forward, acknowledging “the importance of developing renewable energy projects.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no trust. That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that was hardly enough power to provide what the island needed, and critics said the agreement was guilty of the very thing the board accused Puerto Rican regulators of doing: discrediting the permitting process in the eyes of investors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau “negotiated down to the bone to very inexpensive prices” on a handful of projects, says Javier Rúa-Jovet, the chief policy officer at the Solar &amp;amp; Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. “Then the fiscal board—in my opinion arbitrarily—canceled 450 megawatts of projects, saying they were expensive. That action by the fiscal board was a major factor in predetermining the failure of all future large-scale procurements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the independence of the Puerto Rican regulator responsible for issuing and judging the requests for proposals is overruled, project developers no longer believe that anything coming from the government’s local experts will be final. “There’s no trust,” says Rúa-Jovet. “That creates risk. Risk means more money. Things get more expensive. It’s disappointing, but that’s why we weren’t able to build large things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say the board alone bears all responsibility. An investigation released in January by the Energy Bureau blamed PREPA and Luma for causing “deep structural inefficiencies” that “ultimately delayed progress” toward Puerto Rico’s renewables goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The finding only further reinforced the idea that the most trustworthy path to steady power would be one Puerto Ricans built themselves. At the residential scale, Rúa-Jovet says, solar and batteries continue to be popular. Nearly 160,000 households—roughly 13% of the population—have solar panels, and 135,000 of them also have batteries. Of those, just 8,500 households are enrolled in the pilot virtual power plant, a collection of small-scale energy resources that have aggregated together and coordinated with grid operations. During blackouts, he says, Luma can tap into the network of panels and batteries to back up the grid. The total generation capacity on a sunny day is nearly 600 megawatts—eclipsing the 500 megawatts that the coal plant generates. But the project is just at the pilot stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The share of renewables on Puerto Rico’s power grid hit 7% last year, up one percentage point from 2023. That increase was driven primarily by rooftop solar. Despite the growth and dependability of solar, in December Puerto Rican regulators approved New Fortress’s request to build an even bigger gas power station in San Juan, which is currently scheduled to come online in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s been a strong grassroots push for a decentralized grid,” says Cathy Kunkel, a consultant who researches Puerto Rico for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and lived in San Juan until recently. She’d be more interested, she adds, if the proposals focused on “smaller-­scale natural-gas plants” that could be used to back up renewables, but “what they’re talking about doing instead are these giant gas plants in the San Juan metro area.” She says, “That’s just not going to provide the kind of household level of resilience that people are demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s more, New Fortress has taken a somewhat unusual approach to storing its natural gas. The company has built a makeshift import terminal next to a power plant in a corner of San Juan Bay by semipermanently mooring an LNG tanker, a vessel specifically designed for transport. Since Puerto Rico has no connections to an interstate pipeline network, New Fortress argued that the project didn’t require federal permits under the law that governs most natural-gas facilities in the US. As a result, the import terminal did not get federal approval for a safety plan in case of an accident like the ones that recently rocked Texas and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skipping the permitting process also meant skirting public hearings, spurring outrage from Catholic clergy such as Lissette Avilés-Ríos, an activist nun who lives in the neighborhood next to the import terminal and who led protests to halt gas shipments.&amp;nbsp;“Imagine what a hurricane like Maria could do to a natural-gas station like that,” she told me last summer, standing on the shoreline in front of her parish and peering out on San Juan Bay. “The pollution impact alone would be horrible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shipments ultimately did stop for a few months—but not because of any regulatory enforcement. In fact, it was in violation of its contract that New Fortress abruptly cut off shipments when the price of natural gas skyrocketed globally in late 2021. When other buyers overseas said they’d pay higher prices for LNG than the contract in Puerto Rico guaranteed, New Fortress announced with little notice that it would cease deliveries for six months while upgrading its terminal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The missed shipments exemplified the challenges in enforcing Puerto Rico’s contracts with the private companies that control its energy system and highlighted what Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, former president Joe Biden’s senior advisor on Puerto Rico and the territories, called the “troubling” fact that the same company operating the power plants is selling itself the fuel on which they run—disincentivizing any transition to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Territories want to diversify their energy sources and maximize the use of abundant solar energy,” she told me. “The Trump administration’s emphasis on domestic production of fossil fuels and defunding climate and clean-­energy initiatives will not provide the territories with affordable energy options they need to grow their economies, increase their self-sufficiency, and take care of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico’s other energy prospects are limited. The Energy Department study determined that offshore wind would be too expensive. Nuclear is also unlikely; the small modular reactors that would be the most realistic way to deliver nuclear energy here are still years away from commercialization and would likely cost too much for PREPA to purchase. Moreover, nuclear power would almost certainly face fierce opposition from residents in a disaster-prone place that has already seen how willing the federal government is to tolerate high casualty rates in a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;That leaves little option, the federal researchers concluded, beyond the type of utility-scale solar projects the fiscal oversight board has made impossible to build.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Puerto Rico has been unsuccessful in building large-scale solar and large-scale batteries that could have substituted [for] the coal plant’s generation. Without that new, clean generation, you just can’t turn off the coal plant without causing a perennial blackout,” Rúa-Jovet says. “That’s just a physical fact.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lowest-cost energy, depending on who’s paying the price&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AES coal plant does produce some of the least expensive large-scale electricity currently available in Puerto Rico, says Cate Long, the founder of Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, a financial research service targeted at the island’s bondholders. “From a bondholder perspective, [it’s] the lowest cost,” she explains. “From the client and user perspective, it’s the lowest cost. It’s always been the cheapest form of energy down there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue is that the price never factors in the cost to the health of people near the plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The government justifies extending coal plants because they say it’s the cheapest form of energy,” says Aldwin José Colón, 51, who lives across the street from Suárez Vázquez. He says he’s had cancer twice already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an island where nearly half the population relies on health-care programs paid for by frequently depleted Medicaid block grants, he says, “the government ends up paying the expense of people’s asthma and heart attacks, and the people just suffer.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On December 2, 2021, at 9:15 p.m., Edgardo died in the hospital. He was 25 years old.&amp;nbsp;“So many people have died,” Suárez Vázquez told me, choking back tears. “They contaminated the water. The soil. The fish. The coast is black. My son’s insides were black. This never ends.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118413" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25107124641123.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Customers sit inside a restaurant lit by battery-powered lanterns.

At 12:38 p.m. on April 16, as this story was being edited, all of Puerto Rico’s power plants went down in an island-wide outage triggered by a transmission line failure. As officials warned that the blackout would persist well into the next day, Casa Pueblo, a community group that advocates for rooftop solar, posted an invitation on X to charge phones and go online under its outdoor solar array near its headquarters in a town in the western part of Puerto Rico’s central mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Come to the Solar Forest and the Energy Independence Plaza in Adjuntas,” the group beckoned, “where we have electricity and internet.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander C.

I often steal time for visits like this—a perk of global business travel for which I am grateful. Wandering the galleries, I found myself before &lt;em&gt;The Courtesan (after Eisen)&lt;/em&gt;, painted in 1887. Van Gogh had based it on a Japanese woodblock print by Keisai Eisen, which he encountered in the magazine &lt;em&gt;Paris Illustré&lt;/em&gt;. He explicitly copied and reinterpreted Eisen’s composition, adding his own vivid border of frogs, cranes, and bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I stood there, I imagined the painting as the product of a generative AI model prompted with the query &lt;em&gt;How would van Gogh reinterpret a Japanese woodblock in the style of Keisai Eisen?&lt;/em&gt; And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?&amp;nbsp; If van Gogh were working today, that might be the case. Two years ago, the US Supreme Court found that Andy Warhol had infringed upon the photographer Lynn Goldsmith’s copyright by using her photo of the musician Prince for a series of silkscreens. The court said the works were not sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use—a provision in the law that allows for others to make limited use of copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months later, at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, I visited a Salvador Dalí exhibition. I had always thought of Dalí as a true original genius who conjured surreal visions out of thin air. But the show included several Dutch engravings, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s &lt;em&gt;Seven Deadly Sins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(1558), that clearly influenced Dalí’s &lt;em&gt;8 Mortal Sins Suite&lt;/em&gt; (1966). The stylistic differences are significant, but the lineage is undeniable. Dalí himself cited Bruegel as a surrealist forerunner, someone who tapped into the same dream logic and bizarre forms that Dalí celebrated. Suddenly, I was seeing Dalí not just as an original but also as a reinterpreter. Should Bruegel have been flattered that Dalí built on his work—or should he have sued him for making it so “grotesque”?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a later visit to a Picasso exhibit in Milan, I came across a famous informational diagram by the art historian Alfred Barr, mapping how modernist movements like Cubism evolved from earlier artistic traditions. Picasso is often held up as one of modern art’s most original and influential figures, but Barr’s chart made plain the many artists he drew from—Goya, El Greco, Cézanne, African sculptors. This made me wonder: If a generative AI model had been fed all those inputs, might it have produced Cubism? Could it have generated the next great artistic “breakthrough”?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These experiences—spread across three cities and centered on three iconic artists—coalesced into a broader reflection I’d already begun. I had recently spoken with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, about how restrictive copyright laws are in music. Song arrangements and lyrics enjoy longer protection than many pharmaceutical patents. Ek sits at the leading edge of this debate, and he observed that generative AI already produces an astonishing range of music. Some of it is good. Much of it is terrible. But nearly all of it borrows from the patterns and structures of existing work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Musicians already routinely sue one another for borrowing from previous works. How will the law adapt to a form of artistry that’s driven by prompts and precedent, built entirely on a corpus of existing material?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And the questions don’t stop there. Who, exactly, owns the outputs of a generative model? The user who crafted the prompt? The developer who built the model? The artists whose works were ingested to train it? Will the social forces that shape artistic standing—critics, curators, tastemakers—still hold sway? Or will a new, AI-era hierarchy emerge? If every artist has always borrowed from others, is AI’s generative recombination really so different? And in such a litigious culture, how long can copyright law hold its current form? The US Copyright Office has begun to tackle the thorny issues of ownership and says that generative outputs can be copyrighted if they are sufficiently human-authored. But it is playing catch-up in a rapidly evolving field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Different industries are responding in different ways. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that filmmakers’ use of generative AI would not disqualify them from Oscar contention—and that they wouldn’t be required to disclose when they’d used the technology. Several acclaimed films, including Oscar winner &lt;em&gt;The Brutalist&lt;/em&gt;, incorporated AI into their production processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The music world, meanwhile, continues to wrestle with its definitions of originality. Consider the recent lawsuit against Ed Sheeran. In 2016, he was sued by the heirs of Ed Townsend, co-writer of Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On,” who claimed that Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud” copied the earlier song’s melody, harmony, and rhythm. When the case finally went to trial in 2023, Sheeran brought a guitar to the stand. He played the disputed four-chord progression—I–iii–IV–V—and wove together a mash-up of songs built on the same foundation. The point was clear: These are the elemental units of songwriting. After a brief deliberation, the jury found Sheeran not liable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reflecting after the trial, Sheeran said: “These chords are common building blocks … No one owns them or the way they’re played, in the same way no one owns the colour blue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly. Whether it’s expressed with a guitar, a paintbrush, or a generative algorithm, creativity has always been built on what came before.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t consider this essay to be great art. But I should be transparent: I relied extensively on ChatGPT while drafting it. I began with a rough outline, notes typed on my phone in museum galleries, and transcripts from conversations with colleagues. I uploaded older writing samples to give the model a sense of my voice. Then I used the tool to shape a draft, which I revised repeatedly—by hand and with help from an editor—over several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There may still be phrases or sentences in here that came directly from the model. But I’ve iterated so much that I no longer know which ones. Nor, I suspect, could any reader—or any AI detector. (In fact, Grammarly found that 0% of this text appeared to be AI-generated.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many people today remain uneasy about using these tools. They worry it’s cheating, or feel embarrassed to admit that they’ve sought such help. I’ve moved past that. I assume all my students at Harvard Business School are using AI. I assume most academic research begins with literature scanned and synthesized by these models. And I assume that many of the essays I now read in leading publications were shaped, at least in part, by generative tools.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Why? Because we are professionals. And professionals adopt efficiency tools early. Generative AI joins a long lineage that includes the word processor, the search engine, and editing tools like Grammarly. The question is no longer &lt;em&gt;Who’s using AI?&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Why wouldn’t you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I recognize the counterargument, notably put forward by Nicholas Thompson, CEO of the&lt;em&gt; Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;: that content produced with AI assistance should not be eligible for copyright protection, because it blurs the boundaries of authorship. I understand the instinct. AI recombines vast corpora of preexisting work, and the results can feel derivative or machine-like.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But when I reflect on the history of creativity—van Gogh reworking Eisen, Dalí channeling Bruegel, Sheeran defending common musical DNA—I’m reminded that recombination has always been central to creation. The economist Joseph Schumpeter famously wrote that innovation is less about invention than “the novel reassembly of existing ideas.” If we tried to trace and assign ownership to every prior influence, we’d grind creativity to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the outset, I knew the tools had transformative potential. What I underestimated was how quickly they would become ubiquitous across industries and in my own daily work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our copyright system has never required total originality. It demands meaningful human input. That standard should apply in the age of AI as well. When people thoughtfully engage with these models—choosing prompts, curating inputs, shaping the results—they are creating. The medium has changed, but the impulse remains the same: to build something new from the materials we inherit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitin Nohria is the George F.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the influx of cash, the startup is looking to expand its engineering base in India and develop its AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity and all-primary Series E round is led by California-based venture growth firm NewView Capital, with participation from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and NextEquity, the venture firm founded by former Apple executives Avie Tevanian and Fred Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data observability has become increasingly important nowadays as more companies store and leverage data to capitalize on the benefits of AI. However, not everyone in a company has the time or resources to thoroughly investigate an issue or make an important decision based on their data stream. Coralogix aims to solve this challenge with its AI observability agent, Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent utilizes a semantic layer that incorporates internal data, including metadata, along with external sources, such as information available on the internet, to assist companies in understanding complex issues, such as identifying the causes of slow service or resolving the most common system errors, by using simple text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trained to answer broader questions than just what is going wrong, the AI agent can help customers if they want to know which feature is causing customers the most frustration, how much these customers are paying, or who their account representative is that can work with them, Coralogix co-founder and CEO Ariel Assaraf said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Olly includes features such as anomaly detection, access monitoring, and real-time alerts to automate data observability for customers. It was developed by Coralogix’s AI research center, which it now aims to expand through its new capital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside its AI agent, Coralogix provides observability and guardrails to AI companies, offering them insights into the performance of their models, as well as the quality, security, and governance of their responses. All this came through Aporia’s acquisition in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s an opportunity for us, given our architecture of analyzing stream query from remote, lower costs. We’re going to invest a lot there and build out the AI research center bigger,” Assaraf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to leverage India’s engineering base for its AI ambitions, aiming to invest about $100 million in the country over the next five years. The investment is planned to expand its office in Gurugram and hire more staff in Bengaluru and Mumbai to build engineering, R&amp;amp;D, and customer success teams.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of its overall headcount of nearly 550 employees, Coralogix has about 250 people in Israel and 100 in India. It plans to double the Indian employee base over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we see just a really good fit between the Israeli engineering culture and Indian engineering culture, it’s a get-it-done, very independent, very committed to the mission type of engineering that we see a very good fit for us to expand into,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The South Asian market is also the startup’s second-largest market in terms of revenue and user base, with over 100 customers, after the U.S., the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indian companies such as Postman, Jupiter Money, Meesho, BookMyShow, BharatPe, CoinDCX, and Razorpay are among Coralogix’s customers. It also serves banks and enterprises and is looking to tap the Indian government as its next big client. Furthermore, the startup is eyeing the acquisition of Indian startups to expand its footprint in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have spoken to quite a few Indian companies about the potential M&amp;amp;A, but nothing has really been fulfilled. It could be a very good and easy way for us to get a strong core team as we think about expanding our engineering,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In June 2022, Coralogix raised $142 million in a Series D round co-led by Advent International and Brighton Park Capital. Since then, Assaraf said the startup has seen 7x growth in its revenues, although it’s not yet profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup, which views Datadog as its key competitor, aims to file for a U.S. IPO on Nasdaq in three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our goal is we build this new way of architecture, analyzing stream query from remote, this new way of customer engagement, these new geographies that we’re invested in now, also this new AI experience, how you monitor AI and how you use AI to monitor,” Assaraf said. After it can show progress on these fronts, it will explore an IPO, he added.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest round also saw participation from Coralogix’s existing investors, including Advent International, Brighton Park Capital, Revaia, Greenfield Partners, Red Dot Capital Partners, O.G. Venture Partners, Joule Capital Partners, and Maor Investments.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-885762064-e1675765834982.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Coralogix, an Israeli startup offering a full-stack observability and security platform, has raised $115 million at a pre-money valuation of over $1 billion, almost doubling in three years from its last round in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With the influx of cash, the startup is looking to expand its engineering base in India and develop its AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The all-equity and all-primary Series E round is led by California-based venture growth firm NewView Capital, with participation from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and NextEquity, the venture firm founded by former Apple executives Avie Tevanian and Fred Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data observability has become increasingly important nowadays as more companies store and leverage data to capitalize on the benefits of AI. However, not everyone in a company has the time or resources to thoroughly investigate an issue or make an important decision based on their data stream. Coralogix aims to solve this challenge with its AI observability agent, Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The agent utilizes a semantic layer that incorporates internal data, including metadata, along with external sources, such as information available on the internet, to assist companies in understanding complex issues, such as identifying the causes of slow service or resolving the most common system errors, by using simple text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Trained to answer broader questions than just what is going wrong, the AI agent can help customers if they want to know which feature is causing customers the most frustration, how much these customers are paying, or who their account representative is that can work with them, Coralogix co-founder and CEO Ariel Assaraf said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Olly includes features such as anomaly detection, access monitoring, and real-time alerts to automate data observability for customers. It was developed by Coralogix’s AI research center, which it now aims to expand through its new capital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside its AI agent, Coralogix provides observability and guardrails to AI companies, offering them insights into the performance of their models, as well as the quality, security, and governance of their responses. All this came through Aporia’s acquisition in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s an opportunity for us, given our architecture of analyzing stream query from remote, lower costs. We’re going to invest a lot there and build out the AI research center bigger,” Assaraf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to leverage India’s engineering base for its AI ambitions, aiming to invest about $100 million in the country over the next five years. The investment is planned to expand its office in Gurugram and hire more staff in Bengaluru and Mumbai to build engineering, R&amp;amp;D, and customer success teams.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of its overall headcount of nearly 550 employees, Coralogix has about 250 people in Israel and 100 in India. It plans to double the Indian employee base over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because we see just a really good fit between the Israeli engineering culture and Indian engineering culture, it’s a get-it-done, very independent, very committed to the mission type of engineering that we see a very good fit for us to expand into,” Assaraf told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

Legal startup Crosby, which just came out of stealth with a $5.8 million seed round led by Sequoia, is perhaps the most extreme example of what’s coming that we’ve seen to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Crosby isn’t just making AI software for lawyers — although it is doing that. Crosby is an actual law firm using AI to provide legal services at a speed never before possible.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather than selling tech to lawyers, Crosby has hired lawyers who use its internally developed AI software. It sells contract-review legal services, largely to startups. The company is currently promising that its AI software, with human overseers, can review a new client contract in under an hour. And it hopes to get that down even faster — perhaps to just minutes, according to its co-founder CTO John Sarihan, who spoke with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ryan Daniels, Crosby’s co-founder and CEO, is a lawyer himself and the son of two law professors. He cut his teeth at Cooley, one of the biggest firms that represents the tech industry. He then spent the better part of a decade doing general counsel work for startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“My last company, where I was the only legal person, grew from about 10 to 100 people, and I found that most of the time that I was spending on legal was for our contracts, sales agreements, [and] MSAs,” Daniels said, referring to the part of a customer contract known as a master service agreement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Contract negotiations and legal review were such a bottleneck at the company that they were the “reason why we weren’t growing as fast as we wanted to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, contract negotiation remains a human-to-human process, which can take weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While there are a growing number of AI tools that help lawyers speed up parts of their work, Crosby’s founders believed that the only way to use AI to really change the legal industry, was by “building our own law firm in order to own the entire process, end to end,” said Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sarihan, who was an early employee at Ramp, set about hiring software engineers from the startup world, while Daniels began hiring lawyers. Today the startup employs about 19 people, including the founders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The innovation here is in the tech and in the people,” Sarihan said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm soft-launched in January, the co-founders said, and it has already reviewed over 1,000 customer contracts — like MSAs, data processing agreements, and non-disclosure agreements — for fast-growing startups like Cursor and the sales automation startups Clay and UnifyGTM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sequoia’s Josephine Chen and Alfred Lin led the seed round along with Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from a bunch of angels like Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh, Opendoor co-founder Eric Wu, Casetext co-founder Jake Heller, Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, and the co-founders of Flatiron Health, Zach Weinberg and Gil Shklarski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The stars aligned for Crosby to land Sequoia as an investor. Chen knew Sarihan from Ramp. She had previously met him through the co-founder of Venue, an AI procurement startup she had backed and that was acquired by Ramp last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When the co-founders pitched their idea to Chen, she asked Sequoia’s in-house lawyer about the idea, and that lawyer, Cindy Lee, knew Daniels from her time at Cooley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we think about seed investing, for us, it’s probably 70% around the team and 30% around the market, market dynamics, and the insight that the founders have there,” Chen explained. Given all the connections she already had to the founding team and that legal work is a&amp;nbsp;$300 billion industry, Chen was down to disrupt it with Crosby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We had seen, even in our own portfolio [companies], how negotiating contracts can be a bottleneck for growth,” Chen said. Legal, in her view, is “a bull’s-eye case for the use of LLMs.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Crosby-cofounders.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The tech industry talks a lot about how AI is going to transform work.

The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the coal plant opened Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data, cases hit a new high of 209. The question is: How did it get this bad? Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Alexander C. Kaufman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When AIs bargain, a less advanced agent could cost you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The race to build ever larger AI models is slowing down. The industry’s focus is shifting toward agents—systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and negotiate on users’ behalf.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what would happen if both a customer and a seller were using an AI agent? A recent study put agent-to-agent negotiations to the test and found that stronger agents can exploit weaker ones to get a better deal. It’s a bit like entering court with a seasoned attorney versus a rookie: You’re technically playing the same game, but the odds are skewed from the start.

Baker Jr. Professor at Harvard Business School and its former dean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last fall, during a visit to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, I found myself imagining the painting in front of me as the product of a generative AI model prompted with the query &lt;em&gt;How would van Gogh reinterpret a Japanese woodblock in the style of Keisai Eisen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the questions don’t stop there. Who, exactly, owns the outputs of a generative model? The user who crafted the prompt? The developer who built the model? The artists whose works were ingested to train it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Copyright Office has begun to tackle the thorny issues of ownership and says that generative outputs can be copyrighted if they are sufficiently human-authored. But it is playing catch-up in a rapidly evolving field.

Officials had tried to create an effective, fair, and unbiased predictive algorithm to try to detect welfare fraud. But the city fell short of its lofty goals—and, with our partners at Lighthouse Reports and the Dutch newspaper &lt;em&gt;Trouw&lt;/em&gt;, we tried to get to the bottom of why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an American reporter, it’s been an interesting time to write a story on “responsible AI” in a progressive European city—just as ethical considerations in AI deployments appear to be disappearing in the United States, at least at the national level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.

The plant, owned by the utility giant AES, has long plagued this part of Puerto Rico with air and water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the coal plant opened Guayama had on average just over 103 cancer cases per year. In 2003, the year after the plant opened, the number of cancer cases in the municipality surged by 50%, to 167. In 2022, the most recent year with available data, cases hit a new high of 209.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When AIs bargain, a less advanced agent could cost you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The race to build ever larger AI models is slowing down. The industry’s focus is shifting toward agents—systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and negotiate on users’ behalf.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what would happen if both a customer and a seller were using an AI agent? A recent study put agent-to-agent negotiations to the test and found that stronger agents can exploit weaker ones to get a better deal. It’s a bit like entering court with a seasoned attorney versus a rookie: You’re technically playing the same game, but the odds are skewed from the start.

Baker Jr. Professor at Harvard Business School and its former dean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last fall, during a visit to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, I found myself imagining the painting in front of me as the product of a generative AI model prompted with the query &lt;em&gt;How would van Gogh reinterpret a Japanese woodblock in the style of Keisai Eisen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;And I wondered: If van Gogh had used such an AI tool to stimulate his imagination, would Eisen—or his heirs—have had a strong legal claim?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the questions don’t stop there. Who, exactly, owns the outputs of a generative model? The user who crafted the prompt? The developer who built the model? The artists whose works were ingested to train it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Copyright Office has begun to tackle the thorny issues of ownership and says that generative outputs can be copyrighted if they are sufficiently human-authored. But it is playing catch-up in a rapidly evolving field.

Officials had tried to create an effective, fair, and unbiased predictive algorithm to try to detect welfare fraud. But the city fell short of its lofty goals—and, with our partners at Lighthouse Reports and the Dutch newspaper &lt;em&gt;Trouw&lt;/em&gt;, we tried to get to the bottom of why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an American reporter, it’s been an interesting time to write a story on “responsible AI” in a progressive European city—just as ethical considerations in AI deployments appear to be disappearing in the United States, at least at the national level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also made me think more deeply about the stakes of deploying AI in situations that directly affect human lives, and about what success would even look like.

The company’s Language Processing Unit (LPU) is a specialised chip designed from the ground up to handle the unique computational patterns of language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional processors that struggle with the sequential nature of language tasks, Groq’s architecture embraces this characteristic. The result? Dramatically reduced response times and higher throughput for AI applications that need to process text quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can now access numerous popular open-source models through Groq’s infrastructure, including Meta’s Llama 4 and Qwen’s QwQ-32B. This breadth of model support ensures teams aren’t sacrificing capabilities for performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have multiple ways to incorporate Groq into their workflows, depending on their preferences and existing setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who already have a relationship with Groq, Hugging Face allows straightforward configuration of personal API keys within account settings. This approach directs requests straight to Groq’s infrastructure while maintaining the familiar Hugging Face interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, users can opt for a more hands-off experience by letting Hugging Face handle the connection entirely, with charges appearing on their Hugging Face account rather than requiring separate billing relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration works seamlessly with Hugging Face’s client libraries for both Python and JavaScript, though the technical details remain refreshingly simple. Even without diving into code, developers can specify Groq as their preferred provider with minimal configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers using their own Groq API keys are billed directly through their existing Groq accounts. For those preferring the consolidated approach, Hugging Face passes through the standard provider rates without adding markup, though they note that revenue-sharing agreements may evolve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugging Face even offers a limited inference quota at no cost—though the company naturally encourages upgrading to PRO for those making regular use of these services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This partnership between Hugging Face and Groq emerges against a backdrop of intensifying competition in AI infrastructure for model inference. As more organisations move from experimentation to production deployment of AI systems, the bottlenecks around inference processing have become increasingly apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing is a natural evolution of the AI ecosystem. First came the race for bigger models, then came the rush to make them practical. Groq represents the latter—making existing models work faster rather than just building larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses weighing AI deployment options, the addition of Groq to Hugging Face’s provider ecosystem offers another choice in the balance between performance requirements and operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance extends beyond technical considerations. Faster inference means more responsive applications, which translates to better user experiences across countless services now incorporating AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sectors particularly sensitive to response times (e.g. customer service, healthcare diagnostics, financial analysis) stand to benefit from improvements to AI infrastructure that reduces the lag between question and answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI continues its march into everyday applications, partnerships like this highlight how the technology ecosystem is evolving to address the practical limitations that have historically constrained real-time AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Michał Mancewicz)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; NVIDIA helps Germany lead Europe’s AI manufacturing race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-11874" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

&lt;p&gt;As organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to produce large portions of their codebases, the need for effective oversight and quality assurance tools is growing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Qodo’s CEO Itamar Friedman, AI-generated code is no longer just supplemental — it is becoming foundational to modern development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Imagine a future where AI writes all the code; humans won’t be able to review it,” said Friedman. “There must be a system to ensure the values and intentions behind that code remain intact.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-qodo-s-journey-has-all-led-up-to-this-point"&gt;Qodo’s journey has all led up to this point&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before its collaboration with Google Cloud, Qodo had already made notable strides in the enterprise software development space. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as Codium, the company rebranded to Qodo in fall 2024 to reflect its growing focus on holistic code quality and AI-driven engineering support. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of its major breakthroughs came in February 2025 with the release of &lt;strong&gt;Qodo-Embed-1-1.5B&lt;/strong&gt;, a lightweight yet high-performing open-source code embedding model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 1.5-billion-parameter model achieved top scores on industry-standard benchmarks like the Code Information Retrieval Benchmark (CoIR), outperforming larger and more resource-intensive offerings from OpenAI and Salesforce. It was designed specifically to help development teams search, retrieve, and contextualize code accurately across vast, multi-language codebases—making it particularly relevant for large-scale enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qodo has also explored the application of AI agents for regression testing with the release of &lt;strong&gt;Qodo Cover&lt;/strong&gt; in December 2024, a fully autonomous tool that validates whether software changes continue to meet quality and coverage criteria. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Introduced at AWS re:Invent, Qodo Cover demonstrated its capabilities by successfully contributing validated code to Hugging Face’s open-source PyTorch Image Models repository. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s approach emphasizes modular, task-specific AI agents that assist with discrete engineering tasks like test generation, code review, and embedding, rather than pursuing an all-in-one solution. As CEO Itamar Friedman put it, the goal is not just to write more code faster but to ensure that AI-generated code integrates reliably and adheres to best practices in complex systems—a concern especially pressing as AI tools generate an increasing share of enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We see ourselves as responsible for building the machine that observes the machine—verifying not just software practices, but also values,” Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-code-review-for-open-source-projects"&gt;Free code review for open source projects&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the center of the partnership is &lt;strong&gt;Qodo Merge&lt;/strong&gt;, an AI-powered code review tool that uses Google’s Gemini models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qodo Merge analyzes code for potential bugs, structural issues, and deviations from best practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the collaboration, this tool will be offered at no cost to open-source software maintainers, helping ensure quality at the core of widely-used community projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Friedman explained the significance of this initiative: “By helping open source projects to maintain the highest quality standards, we’re strengthening the building blocks of the entire development ecosystem while creating intelligent guardrails that let developers move confidently at AI speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deep-integration-into-a-large-and-growing-ecosystem"&gt;Deep integration into a large and growing ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qodo’s suite of tools is now natively integrated with Google Cloud, offering users direct access through services like Vertex AI and the Google Cloud Marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes &lt;strong&gt;QodoEmbed&lt;/strong&gt;, Qodo’s compact and high-performing code embedding model, now listed in Vertex AI’s Model Garden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our code embedding model is now in Google’s Model Garden, making deployment much easier for our clients,” Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The embedding model enables fast, accurate code search and context retrieval—key features for modern AI coding workflows. It simplifies implementation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and is optimized for enterprise deployment, including GPU-based infrastructure provided by Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhanced-code-assist-built-atop-google-s-powerful-gemini-2-5-pro-llm"&gt;Enhanced code assist built atop Google’s powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the integration is the enhancement of &lt;strong&gt;Qodo Gen&lt;/strong&gt;, Qodo’s AI code assistant. By incorporating Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model, Qodo Gen now delivers more context-aware and accurate code suggestions, offering developers a smoother AI-assisted development experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These improvements also make Qodo’s tools compatible with emerging developer workflows, such as fully automated commit-and-review cycles powered by AI agents working in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Qodo has designed its platform with flexibility in mind, offering both headless and head-full solutions. This modular approach allows enterprise users to pick and choose components—such as code review, embeddings, or context agents—and integrate them into existing workflows via API, CLI, or native connectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re both a headless and headful company, offering modular technology so enterprises can build workflows tailored to their needs,” Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach appeals particularly to large organizations with complex pipelines. Qodo’s tools are already in use by Fortune 500 companies, including Intuit and NVIDIA. In fact, NVIDIA has showcased Qodo’s capabilities at industry events and detailed how they integrate Qodo’s tools into their own AI workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supporting-startups-via-google-cloud-perks"&gt;Supporting startups via Google Cloud Perks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To extend its reach beyond large enterprises, Qodo is participating in Google Cloud’s Startup Perks program. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of this initiative, eligible early-stage companies can receive a 50% discount on Qodo’s tools that they are using for non open source, commercial/proprietary products. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to make enterprise-grade code quality solutions accessible to fast-growing startups looking to scale responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re enabling startups and enterprises alike to use Qodo seamlessly with Google Cloud, and we’re offering discounts to make that integration even easier,” said Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This program aligns with Qodo’s broader mission of eliminating the tradeoff between speed and quality in software development—a theme Friedman repeated throughout his remarks about the collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-commitment-to-quality-above-all"&gt;A commitment to quality above all&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI tools begin to generate code across all layers of the tech stack—from IDEs and design systems to cloud infrastructure—Qodo sees an urgent need for quality validation tools that operate independently of the code’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Friedman likened Qodo’s role to that of an observability provider: just as companies like Datadog monitor applications regardless of where they are deployed, Qodo aims to verify code quality regardless of how or where that code is written.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding itself in platforms like Google Cloud, Qodo is positioning its solution as a neutral, cross-platform standard for validating code integrity in a landscape where AI-driven development is rapidly becoming the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

The funding was led by returning investor General Catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even though 10-year-old Sword Health is cash-flow positive, its CEO and founder, Virgílio Bento, told TechCrunch that he opted to raise additional capital for two key reasons: to update the company’s valuation, and have funds readily available for strategic acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sword Health, which began as a virtual physical therapist and has since expanded into offering pelvic health and mental health services, had previously considered a near-term IPO. Bento told TechCrunch last year that a 2025 listing was a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite the recent successful IPOs of counterparts Hinge Health and Omada,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and Sword’s healthy $240 million annual revenue run rate, Bento is reconsidering his IPO plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s going to be much later than everyone expects,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bento’s goal is for Phoenix, Sword’s AI care specialist, to extend remote healthcare beyond musculoskeletal pain and pelvic floor care to numerous conditions, such as cardiovascular care, gastroenterological health, and speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I want to IPO when I have lots of different proof points at scale in many different care verticals — so maybe 2028,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent months, Bento has embarked on what he calls an “educational journey” to learn about managing a public company, speaking with CEOs of various public companies and bankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At the end of that education period, I realized that if you ask me why we shouldn’t IPO, I can give you 10 reasons. If you ask me why we should IPO, I cannot find one reason,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bento isn’t convinced by the typical reasons for an IPO, such as brand building or capital access. Pointing to Ikea and Lego as examples of successful private companies, he said strong startups can still secure ample private capital, citing Databricks’ massive $10 billion raise.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liquidity for employees and early shareholders is also easily attainable for private companies thanks to secondary markets, Bento said, adding that Sword will likely launch a tender offer next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sword expects to raise more capital next year, Bento said. He’s even predicting the size and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;valuation of the company’s next funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Last year, we raised $30 million at a $3 billion valuation. This year, we did $40 million at $4 billion. I think you can imagine the type of raise we’re going to do next year, which is probably going to be $50 million at $5 billion,” he said. “I like the numerical symmetry. I think it’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest round brings Sword’s total funding to $380 million. Other participants in the new round include Khosla Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Lince Capital, Oxy Capital, Armilar, Indico Capital, and Shilling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240523_SwordHealth_ProductionLaunch_60s_1080p_16x9-FINAL-DELIVERY.00_00_19_19.Still014-1-1.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Sword Health, an AI-powered digital health startup, has raised $40 million at a $4 billion valuation, a 33% jump from the $3 billion price tag it earned just a year ago.

&lt;p&gt;Industrial sectors depend on skilled workers to perform a variety of error-prone tasks, including operating high-precision scanners for reality capture — the process of capturing digital data to replicate the real world in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Hexagon LIVE Global conference, Hexagon’s robotics division today unveiled AEON — a new humanoid robot built in collaboration with NVIDIA that’s engineered to perform a wide range of industrial applications, from manipulation and asset inspection to reality capture and operator support. Hexagon plans to deploy AEON across automotive, transportation, aerospace, manufacturing, warehousing and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future use cases for AEON include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reality capture&lt;/b&gt;, which involves automatic planning and then scanning of assets, industrial spaces and environments to generate 3D models. The captured data is then used for advanced visualization and collaboration in the Hexagon Digital Reality (HxDR) platform powering Hexagon Reality Cloud Studio (RCS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manipulation &lt;/b&gt;tasks, such as sorting and moving parts in various industrial and manufacturing settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part inspection&lt;/b&gt;, which includes checking parts for defects or ensuring adherence to specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrial operations&lt;/b&gt;, including highly dexterous technical tasks like machinery operations, teleoperation and scanning parts using high-end scanners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The age of general-purpose robotics has arrived, due to technological advances in simulation and physical AI,” said Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge AI at NVIDIA. “Hexagon’s new AEON humanoid embodies the integration of NVIDIA’s three-computer robotics platform and is making a significant leap forward in addressing industry-critical challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-82402 alignnone" height="945" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hexagon-car-door-1680x945.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using NVIDIA’s Three Computers to Develop AEON&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build AEON, Hexagon used NVIDIA’s three computers for developing and deploying physical AI systems. They include AI supercomputers to train and fine-tune powerful foundation models; the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, running on NVIDIA OVX servers, for testing and optimizing these models in simulation environments using real and physically based synthetic data; and NVIDIA IGX Thor robotic computers to run the models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexagon is exploring using NVIDIA accelerated computing to post-train the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.5 open foundation model to improve robot reasoning and policies, and tapping Isaac GR00T-Mimic to generate vast amounts of synthetic motion data from a few human demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEON learns many of its skills through simulations powered by the NVIDIA Isaac platform. Hexagon uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a reference robotic simulation application built on Omniverse, to simulate complex robot actions like navigation, locomotion and manipulation. These skills are then refined using reinforcement learning in NVIDIA Isaac Lab, an open-source framework for robot learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simulation-first approach enabled Hexagon to fast-track its robotic development, allowing AEON to master core locomotion skills in just 2-3 weeks — rather than 5-6 months — before real-world deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, AEON taps into NVIDIA Jetson Orin onboard computers to autonomously move, navigate and perform its tasks in real time, enhancing its speed and accuracy while operating in complex and dynamic environments. Hexagon is also planning to upgrade AEON with NVIDIA IGX Thor to enable functional safety for collaborative operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal with AEON was to design an intelligent, autonomous humanoid that addresses the real-world challenges industrial leaders have shared with us over the past months,” said Arnaud Robert, president of Hexagon’s robotics division. “By leveraging NVIDIA’s full-stack robotics and simulation platforms, we were able to deliver a best-in-class humanoid that combines advanced mechatronics, multimodal sensor fusion and real-time AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Comes to Life Through Reality Capture and Omniverse Integration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEON will be piloted in factories and warehouses to scan everything from small precision parts and automotive components to large assembly lines and storage areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-82408" height="945" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/hexagon-aeon-1680x945.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captured data comes to life in RCS, a platform that allows users to collaborate, visualize and share reality-capture data by tapping into HxDR and NVIDIA Omniverse running in the cloud. This removes the constraint of local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital twins offer clear advantages, but adoption has been challenging in several industries,” said Lucas Heinzle, vice president of research and development at Hexagon’s robotics division. “AEON’s sophisticated sensor suite enables the integration of reality data capture with NVIDIA Omniverse, streamlining workflows for our customers and moving us closer to making digital twins a mainstream tool for collaboration and innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;AEON’s Next Steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adopting the OpenUSD framework and developing on Omniverse, Hexagon can generate high-fidelity digital twins from scanned data — establishing a data flywheel to continuously train AEON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest work with Hexagon is helping shape the future of physical AI — delivering scalable, efficient solutions to address the challenges faced by industries that depend on capturing real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;

Just do it and move forward step by step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a personal mantra; it’s the blueprint for how Huawei is navigating a storm of international sanctions and blockades. It’s a quiet determination that ripples through all his answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the conversation shifts to Huawei’s advanced Ascend AI chips, he is almost brutally honest. He doesn’t boast. In fact, he believes the hype has gotten ahead of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The United States has exaggerated Huawei’s achievements. Huawei is not that great yet,” he admits, noting that their best chips are still a generation behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you do when you can’t buy the best tools? According to Ren, you get smarter with the ones you have. He explains that Huawei is leaning on its brilliance in software and mathematics to close the hardware gap in AI and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We use mathematics to make up for physics,” he says, describing a strategy of using code and linking chips together in powerful clusters to achieve results that can compete with the very best. Ingenuity born from necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This grounded perspective applies to people as much as it does to products. In an age of relentless corporate promotion, Ren is wary of the spotlight. “We are also under a lot of pressure when people praise us,” he reveals. “We will be more sober when people criticise us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sees criticism of Huawei not as an attack, but as a gift from the people who actually use their products. It’s a sign of a healthy relationship. His focus remains unwavering: “Don’t care about praise or criticism, but care about whether you can do well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real heart of Ren’s vision, the idea that truly animates him, lies in something much deeper and slower than the next product cycle: basic scientific research. He speaks about it with the passion of a philosopher, arguing it is the very soul of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we do not do basic research, we will have no roots,” he warns. “Even if the leaves are lush and flourishing, they will fall down when the wind blows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Huawei, these are not just poetic words. They are backed by huge investment. Out of an annual R&amp;amp;D budget of 180 billion yuan (around $25 billion) a full third of it – 60 billion yuan (~$8.34 billion) – is poured into theoretical research. This is money spent without the expectation of an immediate return, a long-term bet on the power of human curiosity. It’s an investment in a future that may be decades away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking toward that future, Ren sees AI as a monumental shift not just for Huawei but for humanity. He believes China is well-positioned for this new era, not just because of its technology, but because of its powerful infrastructure and, most importantly, its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ren imagines a future where the real breakthroughs in AI won’t just come from programmers in tech giants like Huawei, but from experts in every field – doctors, engineers, and even miners – using AI to solve real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His optimism is infectious. He recalls an op-ed by New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman who departed China and published an article earlier this year with a title that requires no further explanation: ‘I Just Saw the Future.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is advancing across a wide range of fields, with one of the most important developments being its growing capacity for reasoning. This capability could help AI becomes a reliable partner in critical domains like scientific research and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support this progress, we’ve identified three primary strategies to strengthen reasoning capabilities in both small and large language models: improve architectural design to boost performance in smaller models; incorporate mathematical reasoning techniques to increase reliability; and build stronger generalization capabilities to enable reasoning across a variety of fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="smarter-reasoning-in-smaller-models"&gt;Smarter reasoning in smaller models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While language models trained on broad world knowledge hold great potential, they lack the ability to learn continuously and refine their understanding. This limitation becomes especially pronounced in smaller models, where limited capacity makes strong reasoning even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The problem stems from how current language models operate. They rely on fast, pattern recognition-based responses that break down in complex scenarios. In contrast, people use deliberate, step-by-step reasoning, test different approaches, and evaluate outcomes. To address this gap, we’re building methods to enable stronger reasoning in smaller systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;rStar-Math is a method that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to simulate deeper, more methodical reasoning in smaller models. It uses a three-step, self-improving cycle:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem decomposition&lt;/strong&gt; breaks down complex mathematical problems into manageable steps, creating a thorough and accurate course of reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process preference model (PPM)&lt;/strong&gt; trains small models to predict reward labels for each step, improving process-level supervision.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative refinement&lt;/strong&gt; applies a four-round, self-improvement cycle in which updated strategy models and PPMs guide MCTS to improve performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When tested on four small language models ranging from 1.5 billion to 7 billion parameters, rStar-Math achieved an average accuracy of 53% on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)—performance that places it among the top 20% of high school competitors in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

The rStar-Math framework &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Logic-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that strengthens logical reasoning through a practical system prompt and a structured reward function. By training models on logic puzzles, Logic-RL grants rewards only when both the reasoning process and the final answer meet strict formatting requirements. This prevents shortcuts and promotes analytical rigor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Language models trained with Logic-RL demonstrate strong performance beyond logic puzzles, generalizing effectively to mathematical competition problems. On the AIME and AMC (American Mathematics Competitions) datasets, 7-billion-parameter models improved accuracy by 125% and 38%, respectively, compared with baseline models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-reliable-mathematical-reasoning"&gt;Building reliable mathematical reasoning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mathematics poses a unique challenge for language models, which often struggle to meet its precision and rigor using natural language. To address this, we’re creating formal and symbolic methods to enable language models to adopt structured mathematical tools. The goal is to convert language model outputs into code based on the fundamental rules of arithmetic, like 1 + 1 = 2, allowing us to systematically verify accuracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LIPS (LLM-based Inequality Prover with Symbolic Reasoning) is a system that combines LLMs’ pattern recognition capabilities with symbolic reasoning. LIPS draws on the strategies participants in math competitions use in order to distinguish between tasks best suited to symbolic solvers (e.g., scaling) and those better handled by language models (e.g., rewriting). On 161 Olympiad-level problems, LIPS achieved state-of-the-art results without additional training data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2: A three-part diagram showing the LIPS framework for inequality proof generation. On the left, a current inequality problem is transformed into new inequality subproblems via tactic generation using symbolic-based and LLM-generated rewriting methods. In the center, these new goals are filtered and ranked using LLM and symbolic methods. On the right, a ranked sequence of inequalities forms a complete proof, applying named tactics like Cauchy-Schwarz, AM-GM, and LLM simplification, ending with the original inequality verified." class="wp-image-1141898" height="426" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-2.png" width="1295" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2. An overview of LIPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, translating natural-language math problems into precise, machine-readable formats is a challenge. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the one-pass success rate, where the top-ranked generated result is correct, and the k-pass success rate, where at least one of the top &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; generated results is correct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We developed a new framework using two evaluation methods. &lt;strong&gt;Symbolic equivalence&lt;/strong&gt; checks whether outputs are logically identical, while &lt;strong&gt;semantic consistency&lt;/strong&gt; uses embedding similarity to detect subtle differences missed by symbolic checks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we evaluated this approach on the MATH and miniF2F datasets, which include problems from various math competitions, it improved accuracy by up to 1.35 times over baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3: A flowchart illustrating the autoformalization framework. On the left, a natural language math statement is converted into a formal language theorem via an " class="wp-image-1141897" for="for" height="377" multiple="multiple" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-3.png" width="1271" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3. An overview of the auto-formalization framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address the shortage of high-quality training data, we developed a neuro-symbolic framework that automatically generates diverse, well-structured math problems. Symbolic solvers create the problems, while language models translate them into natural language. This approach not only broadens training resources but also supports more effective instruction and evaluation of mathematical reasoning in language models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4: A flowchart illustrating the neuro-symbolic data generation framework. It begins with a natural language math problem about a sandbox's perimeter. This is formalized into symbolic assertions, then mutated while preserving structure. The formal problem is solved and informalized into a new natural language Q&amp;amp;A about a garden's dimensions. The process continues with further mutation to generate problems of varying difficulty—examples include an easy question about a rectangle’s width and a medium one involving expressions for area." class="wp-image-1142036" height="404" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-4.png" width="1255" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4. An overview of the neuro-symbolic data generation framework &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="boosting-generalization-across-domains"&gt;Boosting generalization across domains&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key indicator of advanced AI is its ability to generalize—the ability to transfer reasoning skills across different domains. We found that training language models on math data significantly improved performance in coding, science, and other areas, revealing unexpected cross-domain benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery motivated us to develop Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), an approach that unifies reasoning across natural language, code, and symbolic forms. CoR lets models blend these formats using natural language to frame context, code for precise calculations, and symbolic representations for abstraction. By adjusting prompts, CoR adapts both reasoning depth and paradigm diversity to match specific problem requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests of CoR across five math datasets showed its ability to tackle both computational and proof-based problems, demonstrating strong general mathematical problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5: Diagram illustrating three reasoning paradigms: (a) Single-paradigm reasoning, where all reasoning steps use the same medium (e.g., natural language, algorithms, or symbols); (b) Tool-integrated single-paradigm reasoning, where natural language drives reasoning, but code is used to solve specific sub-problems, with results reintegrated into the language-based reasoning; (c) CoR (multi-paradigm) reasoning framework, which enables reasoning across different paradigms with varying depths to handle diverse problem types, supported by examples." class="wp-image-1141896" height="493" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-5.png" width="1183" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5. CoR’s reasoning process under different types of methods&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current language models often rely on domain-specific solutions, limiting their flexibility across different types of problems. To move beyond this constraint, we developed Critical Plan Step Learning (CPL), an approach focused on high-level abstract planning that teaches models to identify key knowledge, break down problems, and make strategic decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technique draws on how people solve problems, by breaking them down, identifying key information, and recalling relevant knowledge—strategies we want language models to learn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPL combines two key components: &lt;strong&gt;plan-based MCTS&lt;/strong&gt;, which searches multi-step solution paths and constructs planning trees, and &lt;strong&gt;step-APO&lt;/strong&gt;, which learns preferences for strong intermediate steps while filtering out weak ones. This combination enhances reasoning and improves generalization across tasks, moving AI systems closer to the flexible thinking that characterizes human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6: Illustration of CPL. Left: Plans represent abstract thinking for problem-solving, which allows for better generalization, whereas task-specific solutions often limit it. Right: CPL searches within the action space on high-level abstract plans using MCTS and obtains advantage estimates for step-level preferences. CPL can then identify and learn critical steps that provide a distinct advantage over others." class="wp-image-1141895" height="585" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-6.png" width="1238" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6. Overview of the CPL framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-ahead-next-steps-in-ai-reasoning"&gt;Looking ahead: Next steps in AI reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From building reliable math solvers to unifying reasoning approaches, researchers are redefining how language models approach complex tasks. Their work sets the stage for more capable and versatile AI systems—applicable to education, science, healthcare, and beyond. Despite these advances, hallucinations and imprecise logic continue to pose risks in critical fields like medicine and scientific research, where accuracy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges are driving the team’s exploration of additional tools and frameworks to improve language model reasoning. This includes AutoVerus for automated proof generation in Rust code, SAFE for addressing data scarcity in Rust formal verification, and Alchemy, which uses symbolic mutation to improve neural theorem proving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these technologies represent important progress toward building trustworthy, high-performing reasoning models and signal a broader shift toward addressing some of AI’s current limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPL combines two key components: &lt;strong&gt;plan-based MCTS&lt;/strong&gt;, which searches multi-step solution paths and constructs planning trees, and &lt;strong&gt;step-APO&lt;/strong&gt;, which learns preferences for strong intermediate steps while filtering out weak ones. This combination enhances reasoning and improves generalization across tasks, moving AI systems closer to the flexible thinking that characterizes human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6: Illustration of CPL. Left: Plans represent abstract thinking for problem-solving, which allows for better generalization, whereas task-specific solutions often limit it. Right: CPL searches within the action space on high-level abstract plans using MCTS and obtains advantage estimates for step-level preferences. CPL can then identify and learn critical steps that provide a distinct advantage over others." class="wp-image-1141895" height="585" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/enhancing-llm-reasoning-abilities-6.png" width="1238" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6. Overview of the CPL framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-ahead-next-steps-in-ai-reasoning"&gt;Looking ahead: Next steps in AI reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From building reliable math solvers to unifying reasoning approaches, researchers are redefining how language models approach complex tasks. Their work sets the stage for more capable and versatile AI systems—applicable to education, science, healthcare, and beyond. Despite these advances, hallucinations and imprecise logic continue to pose risks in critical fields like medicine and scientific research, where accuracy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges are driving the team’s exploration of additional tools and frameworks to improve language model reasoning. This includes AutoVerus for automated proof generation in Rust code, SAFE for addressing data scarcity in Rust formal verification, and Alchemy, which uses symbolic mutation to improve neural theorem proving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these technologies represent important progress toward building trustworthy, high-performing reasoning models and signal a broader shift toward addressing some of AI’s current limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We designed Gemini 2.5 to be a family of hybrid reasoning models that provide amazing performance, while also being at the Pareto Frontier of cost and speed. Today, we’re taking the next step with our 2.5 Pro and Flash models by releasing them as stable and generally available. And we’re bringing you 2.5 Flash-Lite in preview — our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro generally available&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of your feedback, today we’re releasing stable versions of 2.5 Flash and Pro, so you can build production applications with confidence. Developers like Spline and Rooms and organizations like Snap and SmartBear have already been using the latest versions in-production for the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also introducing a preview of the new Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. You can start building with the preview version now, and we’re looking forward to your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks. It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts. It comes with the same capabilities that make Gemini 2.5 helpful, including the ability to turn thinking on at different budgets, connecting to tools like Google Search and code execution, multimodal input, and a 1 million-token context length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more details about our 2.5 family of models in the latest Gemini technical report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 id="introducing-gemini-2.5-flash-lite"&gt;Introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing 2.5 Flash-Lite in preview with the lowest latency and cost in the 2.5 model family. It’s designed as a cost-effective upgrade from our previous 1.5 and 2.0 Flash models. It also offers better performance across most evals, and lower time to first token while also achieving higher tokens per second decode. This model is great for high throughput tasks like classification or summarization at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is a reasoning model, which allows for dynamic control of the thinking budget with an API parameter. Because Flash-Lite is optimized for cost and speed, “thinking” is off by default, unlike our other models. 2.5 Flash-Lite also supports all of our native tools like Grounding with Google Search, Code Execution, and URL Context in addition to function calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;h2 id="updates-to-gemini-2.5-flash-and-pricing"&gt;Updates to Gemini 2.5 Flash and pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, our research teams have continued to push the pareto frontier with our Flash model series. When 2.5 Flash was initially announced, we had not yet finalized the capabilities for 2.5 Flash-Lite. We also launched with a “thinking” and “non-thinking price”, which led to developer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the stable version of Gemini 2.5 Flash rolling out (which is the same 05-20 model preview we made available at Google I/O), and the incredible performance of 2.5 Flash, we are updating the pricing for 2.5 Flash:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$0.30 / 1M input tokens (*up from $0.15 input)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$2.50 / 1M output tokens (*down from $3.50 output)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We removed the thinking vs. non-thinking price difference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We kept a single price tier regardless of input token size&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we strive to maintain consistent pricing between preview and stable releases to minimize disruption, this is a specific adjustment reflecting Flash’s exceptional value, still offering the best cost-per-intelligence available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, we now have an even lower cost option (with or without thinking) for cost and latency sensitive use cases that require less model intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div class="image-wrapper"&gt;
            
                &lt;img alt="Pricing updates for our Gemini Flash family" class="regular-image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/images/gemini_2-5_flash-lite_pricing_margin_dark.original.png" /&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using the Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 04-17 , the existing preview pricing will remain in effect until its planned deprecation on July 15, 2025, at which point that model endpoint will be turned off. You can transition to the generally available model “gemini-2.5-flash”, or switch to 2.5 Flash-Lite Preview as a lower cost option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="continued-growth-of-gemini-2.5-pro"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Continued growth of Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth and demand for Gemini 2.5 Pro continues to be the steepest of any of our models we have ever seen. To allow more customers to build on this model in production, we are making the 06-05 version of the model stable, with the same pareto frontier price point as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect that cases where you need the highest intelligence and most capabilities are where you will see Pro shine, like coding and agentic tasks. Gemini 2.5 Pro is at the heart of many of the most loved developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using 2.5 Pro Preview 05-06, the model will remain available until June 19, 2025 and then will be turned off. If you are using 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05, you can simply update your model string to “gemini-2.5-pro”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t wait to see even more domains benefit from the intelligence of 2.5 Pro and look forward to sharing more about scaling beyond Pro in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s designed as a cost-effective upgrade from our previous 1.5 and 2.0 Flash models. It also offers better performance across most evals, and lower time to first token while also achieving higher tokens per second decode. This model is great for high throughput tasks like classification or summarization at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is a reasoning model, which allows for dynamic control of the thinking budget with an API parameter. Because Flash-Lite is optimized for cost and speed, “thinking” is off by default, unlike our other models. 2.5 Flash-Lite also supports all of our native tools like Grounding with Google Search, Code Execution, and URL Context in addition to function calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;h2 id="updates-to-gemini-2.5-flash-and-pricing"&gt;Updates to Gemini 2.5 Flash and pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, our research teams have continued to push the pareto frontier with our Flash model series. When 2.5 Flash was initially announced, we had not yet finalized the capabilities for 2.5 Flash-Lite. We also launched with a “thinking” and “non-thinking price”, which led to developer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the stable version of Gemini 2.5 Flash rolling out (which is the same 05-20 model preview we made available at Google I/O), and the incredible performance of 2.5 Flash, we are updating the pricing for 2.5 Flash:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$0.30 / 1M input tokens (*up from $0.15 input)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$2.50 / 1M output tokens (*down from $3.50 output)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We removed the thinking vs. non-thinking price difference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We kept a single price tier regardless of input token size&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we strive to maintain consistent pricing between preview and stable releases to minimize disruption, this is a specific adjustment reflecting Flash’s exceptional value, still offering the best cost-per-intelligence available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, we now have an even lower cost option (with or without thinking) for cost and latency sensitive use cases that require less model intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div class="image-wrapper"&gt;
            
                &lt;img alt="Pricing updates for our Gemini Flash family" class="regular-image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/images/gemini_2-5_flash-lite_pricing_margin_dark.original.png" /&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using the Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 04-17 , the existing preview pricing will remain in effect until its planned deprecation on July 15, 2025, at which point that model endpoint will be turned off. You can transition to the generally available model “gemini-2.5-flash”, or switch to 2.5 Flash-Lite Preview as a lower cost option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="continued-growth-of-gemini-2.5-pro"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Continued growth of Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth and demand for Gemini 2.5 Pro continues to be the steepest of any of our models we have ever seen. To allow more customers to build on this model in production, we are making the 06-05 version of the model stable, with the same pareto frontier price point as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect that cases where you need the highest intelligence and most capabilities are where you will see Pro shine, like coding and agentic tasks. Gemini 2.5 Pro is at the heart of many of the most loved developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using 2.5 Pro Preview 05-06, the model will remain available until June 19, 2025 and then will be turned off. If you are using 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05, you can simply update your model string to “gemini-2.5-pro”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t wait to see even more domains benefit from the intelligence of 2.5 Pro and look forward to sharing more about scaling beyond Pro in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI executives have discussed filing an antitrust complaint with US regulators against Microsoft, the company's largest investor, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two long-term AI partners. OpenAI, which develops ChatGPT, has reportedly considered seeking a federal regulatory review of the terms of its contract with Microsoft for potential antitrust law violations, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential antitrust complaint would likely argue that Microsoft is using its dominant position in cloud services and contractual leverage to suppress competition, according to insiders who described it as a "nuclear option," the WSJ reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move could unravel one of the most important business partnerships in the AI industry—a relationship that started with a $1 billion investment by Microsoft in 2019 and has grown to include billions more in funding, along with Microsoft's exclusive rights to host OpenAI models on its Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friction centers on OpenAI's efforts to transition from its current nonprofit structure into a public benefit corporation, a conversion that needs Microsoft's approval to complete. The two companies have not been able to agree on details after months of negotiations, sources told Reuters. OpenAI's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation under the proposed restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are discussing revising the terms of Microsoft's investment, including the future equity stake it will hold in OpenAI. According to The Information, OpenAI wants Microsoft to hold a 33 percent stake in a restructured unit in exchange for foregoing rights to future profits. The AI company also wants to modify existing clauses that give Microsoft exclusive rights to host OpenAI models in its cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

In December, Meta Platforms also asked California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partnership strained as OpenAI sought new cloud providers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the US Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration began examining the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership in more detail. Microsoft's $13 billion investment in OpenAI prompted competitors like Google to argue that the deal harmed competition by saddling rivals with extra costs and blocking them from hosting OpenAI's latest models themselves, along with what were then Microsoft's exclusive rights to host OpenAI models on its Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft is no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider as of January, and earlier this month, Reuters reported that OpenAI plans to add Alphabet's Google Cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, marking a notable collaboration between two AI rivals. The shift came alongside OpenAI's participation in the Stargate Project, a new company that intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years in building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft and OpenAI have maintained a public front of cooperation. "Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come," they said in a joint statement to Reuters. In January, a Microsoft blog post noted that "key elements" of the partnership remain in place for the duration of their contract through 2030, including revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft has the rights to OpenAI IP (including models and infrastructure) for use within products like Copilot through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft is no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider as of January, and earlier this month, Reuters reported that OpenAI plans to add Alphabet's Google Cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, marking a notable collaboration between two AI rivals. The shift came alongside OpenAI's participation in the Stargate Project, a new company that intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years in building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft and OpenAI have maintained a public front of cooperation. "Talks are ongoing and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come," they said in a joint statement to Reuters. In January, a Microsoft blog post noted that "key elements" of the partnership remain in place for the duration of their contract through 2030, including revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft has the rights to OpenAI IP (including models and infrastructure) for use within products like Copilot through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new plan, Ultra, offers users 20x more usage on AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI compared to the company’s $20-a-month subscription plan, Pro. Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anysphere CEO Michael Truell said in a blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans — ranging from $100-a-month to $250-a-month — as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users, and offer them increased usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere’s already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor had reached $500 million in annualized recurring revenue and is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Based on TechCrunch’s previous reporting, Cursor’s ARR has grown by $200 million since April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the race to develop “vibecoding” tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedly acquired Cursor’s competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We’ve seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recently slashed Windsurf’s direct access to Claude AI models as a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources towards developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out a new “Tab” AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere’s multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren’t going anywhere just yet. Nonetheless, the competition for users is getting more intense.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1356382582.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anysphere launched a new $200-a-month subscription plan for its popular AI coding tool, Cursor, the company announced in a blog post on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

Intel Foundry designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s unclear how many workers this will directly impact. Intel’s total workforce was 108,900 people as of December 2024, according to the company’s annual regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;

Rumors of these specific layoffs began swirling in April.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google has announced a big expansion of its Gemini AI model family today. After months of tweaking and tuning, the high-power Gemini 2.5 Pro is leaving preview and is ready for developers to build on. Meanwhile, Google is offering a peek at its upcoming high-efficiency model, known as Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite. Try as it might, Google can't get away from confusing model names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's AI aspirations have been looking up in 2025 with the debut of Gemini 2.5. These models showed a marked improvement over past versions, making Google more competitive with OpenAI and its popular GPT models. However, we've been inundated with previews and test builds as Google works toward general availability, which means a model is stable enough for long-term development work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.5 Flash model left preview at I/O, but Gemini 2.5 Pro lagged behind. Today, Flash is hitting general availability with the 04-17 build. Gemini 2.5 Pro is leaving preview and also reaching general availability, and as predicted, the recently revamped 06-05 build is the winner. This version aimed to address some issues that popped up in the Google I/O build of 2.5 Pro, and it appears to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

      Google now has a Gemini model for every task.

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Gemini 2.5 models include adjustable thinking budgets, making them appealing to developers who want more control over costs. For the most price-sensitive devs, Google is also introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, which was previously experimental. This model is now in preview, offering a way to run high-volume AI workloads without incurring significant costs. Compared to 2.5 Flash, it's one-third of the cost for text, image, and video inputs and less than one-sixth of the cost for output tokens. It's unlikely this variant of Gemini will come to the app for regular users, because it's less capable than 2.5 Flash and only makes sense when you're paying by the token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Google Flash and Flash-Lite are coming to search. A Google spokesperson tells Ars that custom versions of these models are now active in AI overviews and AI Mode. Google generally tries to use the model that's the best fit for the query. So, complex AI Mode searches use 2.5 Pro, but something simple could rely on Flash or even Flash-Lite for very basic searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flash-Lite preview is available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI for developers, along with stable versions of Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Pro. You won't see any major changes in the Gemini app, as the final 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash models were already live in the app. The Pro variant will drop the preview label as Flash did last month, but functionality won't be any different. Free users still have limited access to 2.5 Pro in the app, with paying Pro users getting a higher limit of 100 prompts per day. AI Ultra subscribers have the highest level of access to Gemini 2.5 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Google has announced a big expansion of its Gemini AI model family today. After months of tweaking and tuning, the high-power Gemini 2.5 Pro is leaving preview and is ready for developers to build on. Meanwhile, Google is offering a peek at its upcoming high-efficiency model, known as Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite. Try as it might, Google can't get away from confusing model names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's AI aspirations have been looking up in 2025 with the debut of Gemini 2.5. These models showed a marked improvement over past versions, making Google more competitive with OpenAI and its popular GPT models. However, we've been inundated with previews and test builds as Google works toward general availability, which means a model is stable enough for long-term development work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.5 Flash model left preview at I/O, but Gemini 2.5 Pro lagged behind. Today, Flash is hitting general availability with the 04-17 build. Gemini 2.5 Pro is leaving preview and also reaching general availability, and as predicted, the recently revamped 06-05 build is the winner. This version aimed to address some issues that popped up in the Google I/O build of 2.5 Pro, and it appears to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

      Google now has a Gemini model for every task.

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Gemini 2.5 models include adjustable thinking budgets, making them appealing to developers who want more control over costs. For the most price-sensitive devs, Google is also introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, which was previously experimental. This model is now in preview, offering a way to run high-volume AI workloads without incurring significant costs. Compared to 2.5 Flash, it's one-third of the cost for text, image, and video inputs and less than one-sixth of the cost for output tokens. It's unlikely this variant of Gemini will come to the app for regular users, because it's less capable than 2.5 Flash and only makes sense when you're paying by the token.&lt;/p&gt;
