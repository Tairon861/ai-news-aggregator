It is a test case for whether AI – the kind being debated in boardrooms and policy forums globally – can actually reach the last mile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meet Sarlaben: The AI dairy farming assistant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarlaben draws from one of India’s most comprehensive agricultural data repositories. It’s accessible via the Amul Farmer mobile app – already downloaded by over 10 lakh (one million) users on Android and iOS – as well as through voice calls for farmers using feature phones or landlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is integrated with Amul’s Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS) and the Pashudhan application, allowing it to offer personalised, cattle-specific guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Amul AI substantially different from most agricultural chatbots is the scale of its training data. The platform was built on a digital backbone managing over 200 crore (two billion) milk procurement transactions annually, veterinary treatment records from more than 1,200 doctors covering nearly 3 crore (30 million) cattle, approximately 70 lakh (seven million) artificial inseminations conducted each year, ISRO satellite imagery for fodder production mapping, and a cattle census conducted every five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every animal in the system carries a unique ID, with individual records of feed intake, disease history and milking status. “Amul AI is about taking dependable, verified information directly to the farmer – instantly and in a language they are comfortable with,” said Jayen Mehta, Managing Director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets the Amul brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said how, by using decades of structured data and integrating it with their operational systems, the platform will help farmers make timely decisions that improve animal productivity and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India’s productivity paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is the world’s largest producer of milk, generating 347.87 million tonnes in 2024-25 according to the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying – more than double the US’s 102.70 million tonnes. And yet despite leading in volume, India’s per-animal milk yield remains among the lowest globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons are structural. India’s dairy sector is characterised by small herd sizes, low-quality feed, limited access to veterinary care in rural areas, and widespread lack of awareness about modern breeding and husbandry practices. Amul’s network spans more than 18,600 villages in Gujarat, where farmers supply over 350 lakh litres (35 million litres) of milk daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But information asymmetry has long been a bottleneck – a farmer facing a sick animal at midnight in a remote village has few places to turn; the gap Amul AI is designed to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available initially in Gujarati – the primary language of the cooperative’s farmer base – the platform is built on the government’s Bhashini multilingual framework and could, in principle, be extended to 20 Indian languages, reaching Amul’s presence in 20,000 villages in 20 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cooperative model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology story here is inseparable from the institutional one. Amul’s cooperative structure – built over five decades under the original White Revolution – created the data infrastructure that makes Amul AI possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most private agri-tech startups are working backwards: collecting data first, building products second. Amul already had the data. What was needed was a way to make it actionable at the farmer level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts tracking the dairy-tech space see this as significant. Sreeshankar Nair, Founder of Brainwired, a dairy-tech startup, identifies three specific challenges that Amul AI could meaningfully address: farmer awareness, access to quality veterinary guidance, and connectivity to grazing and feed resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If AI can integrate local dialects of Indian languages, India can have White Revolution 2.0,” Nair said, pointing to the transformative potential of vernacular AI in a sector where not every farmer speaks the same dialect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saswata Narayan Biswas, Director of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA) – the institution closely associated with Amul’s founding ethos – frames it as an AI embedded in a cooperative framework. It becomes “not a technology upgrade, but an instrument of inclusive rural transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Biswas, the specific abilities Amul AI brings – predictive disease detection, oestrus tracking, optimised feed formulation, localised weather risk advisories – are abilities Amul had been building for years. AI accelerates and democratises them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scale and the test ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch has drawn backing from the highest levels of government. Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel launched the platform and confirmed it will be showcased at the AI Impact Summit 2026. The cooperative has acknowledged MeitY and the EkStep Foundation – an open digital infrastructure nonprofit – as partners in building the AI layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers not affiliated with Amul can also access general dairying and animal husbandry information through the app. At its current scale, Amul AI already covers more cattle – nearly 3 crore (30 million) – than most national veterinary databases anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harder question, as with most AI deployments at a population scale, is whether the tool will serve those who need it most. The farmers most likely to benefit first – those already comfortable with smartphones, already plugged into Amul’s digital system – may not be the ones with the greatest information deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rollout of Bhashini-enabled dialect support, the adoption rate among feature-phone users relying on voice calls, and whether AI-driven advisories translate into measurable yield improvements will be the metrics that determine whether this is genuinely White Revolution 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amul has built an AI system grounded in half a century of real cooperative transactions, real animals, and real farmers. Such an infrastructure is, arguably, the most credible foundation for AI dairy farming at scale. Whether it fulfils its promise will depend on execution – and on whether Sarlaben’s voice can reach in the last few miles; those that have always been the hardest to cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hitachi bets on industrial expertise to win the physical AI race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Four people were shot and killed on a westbound train as it approached the suburb of Forest Park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The police swiftly activated a digital dragnet—a surveillance network that connects thousands of cameras in the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process began with a quick review of the transit agency’s surveillance cameras, which captured the alleged gunman shooting the victims execution style. Law enforcement followed the suspect, through real-time footage, across the rapid-­transit system. Police officials circulated the images to transit staff and to thousands of officers. An officer in the adjacent suburb of Riverdale recognized the suspect from a previous arrest. By the time he was captured at another train station, just 90&amp;nbsp;minutes after the shooting, authorities already had his name, address, and previous arrest history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Little of this process would come as much surprise to Chicagoans. The city has tens of thousands of surveillance cameras—up to 45,000, by some estimates. That’s among the highest numbers per capita in the US. Chicago boasts one of the largest license plate reader systems in the country, and the ability to access audio and video surveillance from independent agencies such as the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Park District, and the public transportation system as well as many residential and commercial security systems such as Ring doorbell cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement and security advocates say this vast monitoring system protects public safety and works well. But activists and many residents say it’s a surveillance panopticon that creates a chilling effect on behavior and violates guarantees of privacy and free speech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Black and Latino communities in Chicago have historically been targeted by excessive policing and surveillance, says Lance Williams, a scholar of urban violence at Northeastern Illinois University. That scrutiny has created new problems without delivering the promised safety, he suggests. In order to “solve the problem of crime or violence and make these communities safer,” he says, “you have to deal with structural problems,” such as the shortage of livable-wage jobs, affordable housing, and mental-health services across the city.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen some effective pushback against the surveillance. Until recently, for example, the city was the largest customer of ShotSpotter acoustic sensors, which are designed to detect gunfire and alert police. The system was introduced in a small area on the South Side in 2012. By 2018, an area of about 136 square miles—some 60% of the city—was covered by the acoustic surveillance network.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critics questioned ShotSpotter’s effectiveness and objected that the sensors were installed largely in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Those critiques gained urgency with the fatal shooting in March 2021 of a 13-year-old, Adam Toledo, by police responding to a ShotSpotter alert. The tragedy became the touchstone of the #StopShotSpotter protest movement and one of the major issues in Brandon Johnson’s successful mayoral campaign in 2023. When he reached office, Johnson followed through, ending the city’s contract with SoundThinking, the San Francisco Bay Area company behind ShotSpotter. In total, it’s estimated, the city paid more than $53 million for the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment, SoundThinking said that ShotSpotter enables law enforcement “to reach the scene faster, render aid to victims, and locate evidence more effectively.” It said the company “plays no part in the selection of deployment areas” but added: “We believe communities experiencing the highest levels of gun violence deserve the same rapid emergency response as any other neighborhood.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there has been successful resistance to police surveillance in the nation’s third-largest city, there are also countervailing forces: Governments and officials in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs are moving to expand the use of surveillance, also in response to public pressure. Even the victory against acoustic surveillance might be short-lived. Early last year, the city issued a request for proposals for gun violence detection technology.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many people in and around Chicago—digital privacy and surveillance activists, defense attorneys, law enforcement officials, and ordinary citizens—are part of this push and pull. Here are some of their stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Alejandro Ruizesparza and Freddy Martinez&lt;br /&gt;Cofounders, Lucy Parsons Labs&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oak Park, a quiet suburb at Chicago’s western border, is the birthplace of Ernest Hemingway. It includes the world’s largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright–designed buildings and homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the village of Oak Park was also the center of a three-year-long campaign against an unwelcome addition to its manicured lawns and Prairie-style architecture: automated license plate readers from a company called Flock Safety. These are high-speed cameras that automatically scan license plates to look for stolen or wanted vehicles, or for drivers with outstanding warrants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132945" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LPL_DSF7601.jpg?w=2701" width="2701" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Freddy Martinez (left) and Alejandro Ruizesparza (right) direct Lucy Parsons Labs, a charitable organization focused on digital rights.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Oak Park group called Freedom to Thrive—made up of parents, activists, lawyers, data scientists, and many others—suspected that this technology was not a good or equitable addition to their neighborhood. So the group engaged the Chicago-based nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs to help navigate the often intimidating process of requesting license plate reader data under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lucy Parsons Labs, which is named for a turn-of-the-century Chicago labor organizer, investigates technologies such as license plate readers, gunshot detection systems, and police bodycams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LPL provides digital security and public records training to a variety of groups and is frequently called on to help community members audit and analyze surveillance systems that are targeting their neighborhoods. It’s led by two first-­generation Mexican-Americans from the city’s Southwest Side. Alejandro Ruizesparza has a background in community organizing and data science. Freddy Martinez was also a community organizer and has a background in physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group is now approaching its 10th year, but it was an all-volunteer effort until 2022. That’s when LPL received its first unrestricted, multi-year operational grant from a large foundation: the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, known worldwide for its so-called “genius grants.” A grant from the Ford Foundation followed the next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The additional resources—a significant amount compared with the previous all-volunteer budget, acknowledges Ruizesparza—meant the two cofounders and two volunteers became full-time employees. But the group is determined not to become “too comfortable” and lose its edge. There is a tenacity to Lucy Parsons Labs’ work—a “sense of scrappiness,” they say—because “we did so much of this work with no money.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of LPL’s primary strategies is filing extensive FOIA requests for raw data sets of police surveillance. The process can take a while, but it often reveals issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the case of Oak Park, the FOIA requests were just one tool that Freedom to Thrive and LPL used to sort out what was going on. The data revealed that in the first 10 months of operation, the eight Flock license plate readers the town had deployed scanned 3,000,000 plates. But only 42 scans led to an alert—an infinitesimal yield of 0.000014%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the impact was disproportionate. While Oak Park’s population of about 53,000 is only 19% Black, Black drivers made up 85% of those flagged by the Flock cameras, seemingly amplifying what were already concerning racial disparities in the village’s traffic stops. Flock did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We became almost de facto experts in navigating the process and the law. I think that sort of speaks to some of the DIY punk aesthetic.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Freddy Martinez, cofounder, Lucy Parsons Labs&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LPL brings a mix of radical politics and critical theory to its mission. Most surveillance technologies are “largely extensions of the plantation systems,” says Ruizesparza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison makes sense: Many slaveholding communities required enslaved persons to carry signed documents to leave plantations and wear badges with numbers sewn to their clothing. The group says it aims to empower local communities to push back against biased policing technologies through technical assistance, training, and litigation—and to de­mystify algorithms and surveillance tools in the process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we talk to people, they realize that you don’t need to know how to run a regression to understand that a technology has negative implications on your life,” says Ruizesparza. “You don’t need to understand how circuits work to understand that you probably shouldn’t have all of these cameras embedded in only Black and brown regions of a city.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The group came by some of its techniques through experimentation. “When LPL was first getting started, we didn’t really feel like FOIA would have been a good way of getting information. We didn’t know anything about it,” says Martinez. “Along the way, we were very successful in uncovering a lot of surveillance practices.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the covert surveillance practices uncovered by those aggressive FOIA requests, for example, was the Chicago Police Department’s use of “Stingray” equipment, portable surveillance devices deployed to track and monitor mobile phones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The contentious issue of Oak Park’s license plate readers was finally put to a vote in late August. The village trustees voted 5–2 to terminate the contract with Flock Safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since then, community-­based groups from across the country—as far away as California—have contacted LPL to say the Chicago collective’s work has inspired their own efforts, says Martinez: “We became almost de facto experts in navigating the process and the law. I think that sort of speaks to some of the DIY punk aesthetic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brian Strockis &lt;br /&gt;Chief, Oak Brook Police Department&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you drive about 20 miles west of Chicago, you’ll find Oakbrook Center, one of the nation’s leading luxury shopping destinations. The open-air mall includes Neiman-Marcus, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci and attracts high-end shoppers from across the region. It’s also become a destination for retail theft crews that coordinate “smash and grabs” and often escape with thousands of dollars’ worth of inventory that can be quickly sold, such as sunglasses or luxury handbags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early December, police say, a Chicago man tried to lead officers on what could have been a dangerous high-speed chase from the mall. Patrol cars raced to the scene. So did a “first responder drone,” built by Flock Safety and deployed by the Oak Brook Police Department. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drone identified the suspect vehicle from the mall parking lot using its license plate reader and snapped high-definition photos that were texted to officers on the ground. The suspect was later tracked to Chicago, where he was arrested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132947" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BrianStorkis_DSF6009.jpg?w=2756" width="2756" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Brian Strockis, chief of the Oak Brook Police Department, led the way in introducing drones as first responders in the state of Illinois.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was the type of outcome that Brian Strockis, chief of the Oak Brook Police Department, hoped for when he pioneered the “drone as first responder,” or DFR, program in Illinois. A longtime member of the force, he joined the department almost 25 years ago as a patrol officer, worked his way up the brass ladder, and was awarded the top job in 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Oak Brook was the first municipality in Illinois to deploy a drone as a first responder. One of the main reasons, says Strockis, was to reduce the number of high-speed chases, which are potentially dangerous to officers, suspects, and civilians. A drone is also a more effective and cost-efficient way to deal with suspects in fleeing vehicles, says Strockis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police say there was the potential for a dangerous high-speed chase. Patrol cars raced to the scene. But the first unit to arrive was a drone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a force multiplier in that we’re able to do more with less,” says the chief, who spoke with me in his office at Oak Brook’s Village Hall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The department’s drone autonomously launches from the roof of the building and responds to about 10 to 12 service calls per day, at speeds up to 45 miles per hour. It arrives at crime scenes before patrol officers in nine out of every 10 cases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next door to Village Hall is the Oak Brook Police Department’s real-time crime center, a large room with two video walls that integrates livestreams from the first-responder drone, handheld drones, traffic cameras, license plate readers, and about a thousand private security cameras. When I visited, the two DFR operators demonstrated how the machine can fly itself or be directed to locations from a destination entered on Google Maps. They sent it off to a nearby forest preserve and then directed it to return to the rooftop base, where it docks automatically, changes batteries, and charges. After the demo, one of the drone operators logged the flight, as required by state law.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Strockis says he is aware of the privacy concerns around using this technology but that protections are in place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, the drone cannot be used for random or mass surveillance, he says, because the camera is always pointed straight ahead during flight and does not angle down until it reaches its desired location. The drone’s payload does not include facial recognition technology, which is restricted by state law, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drone video footage is invaluable, he adds, because “you are seeing the events as they’re transpiring from an angle that you wouldn’t otherwise be privy to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an extra layer of protection for the public as well as for the officers, says the chief: “For every incident that an officer responds to now, you have squad car and bodycam video. You likely have cell-phone video from the public, officers, complainants, from offenders. So adding this element is probably the best video source on a scene that the police are going to anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mark Wallace &lt;br /&gt;Executive director, Citizens to Abolish Red Light Cameras&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mark Wallace wears several hats. By day he is a real estate investor and mortgage lender. But he is probably best known to many Chicagoans—especially across the city’s largely African-American communities on the South and West Sides—as a talk radio host for the station WVON and one of the leading voices against the city’s extensive network of red-light and speed cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the past two decades, city officials have maintained that the cameras—which are officially known as “automated enforcement”—are a crucial safety measure. They are also a substantial revenue stream, generating around $150 million a year and a total of some $2.5 billion since they were installed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132948" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MarkWallace_DSF6241.jpg?w=1567" width="1567" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Urged on by a radio listener, Mark Wallace started organizing against Chicago’s red-light and speed cameras, a substantial revenue stream for the city that has been found to disproportionately burden majority Black and Latino areas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The one thing that the cameras have the ability to do is generate a lot of money,” Wallace says. He describes the tickets as a “cash grab” that disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking 2022 analysis by ProPublica found, in fact, that households in majority Black and Latino zip codes were ticketed at much higher rates than others, in part because the cameras in those areas were more likely to be installed near expressway ramps and on wider streets, which encouraged faster speeds. The tickets, which can quickly rack up late fees, were also found to cause more of a financial burden in such communities, the report found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These were some of the same concerns that many people expressed on the radio and in meetings, Wallace says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chicago’s automated traffic enforcement began in 2003, and it became the most extensive—and most lucrative—such program in the country. About 300 red-light cameras and 200 speed cameras are set up near schools and parks. The cost of the tickets can quickly double if they are not paid or contested—providing a windfall for the city. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wallace began his advocacy against the cameras soon after arriving at the radio station in the early 2010s. A younger listener called in and said, he recalls, “that he enjoyed the information that came from WVON but that we didn’t do anything.” The comment stuck with him, especially in light of WVON’s storied history. The station was closely involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and broadcast Martin Luther King Jr.’s speeches during his Chicago campaign.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wallace hoped to change the caller’s perception about the station. He had firsthand experience with red-light cameras,&amp;nbsp; having been ticketed himself, and decided to take them on as a cause. He scheduled a meeting at his church for a Friday night, promoting it on his show. “More than 300 people showed up,” he remembers, chatting with me in the spacious project studio and office in the basement of his townhouse on the city’s South Side. “That said to me there are a lot of people who see this in­equity and injustice.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wallace began using his platform on WVON—&lt;em&gt;The People’s Show&lt;/em&gt;—to mobilize communities around social and economic justice, and many discussions revolved around the automated enforcement program. The cause gained traction after city and state officials were found to have taken thousands of dollars from technology and surveillance companies to make sure their cameras remained on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wallace and his group, Citizens to Abolish Red Light Cameras, want to repeal the ordinances authorizing the city’s camera programs. That hasn’t happened so far, but political pressure from the group paved the way for a Chicago City Council ordinance that required public meetings before any red-light cameras are installed, removed, or relocated. The group hopes for more restrictions for speed cameras, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was never about me personally. It was about ensuring that we could demonstrate to people that you have power,” says Wallace. “If you don’t like something, as Barack Obama would say, get a pen and clipboard and go to work to fight to make these changes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Jonathan Manes &lt;br /&gt;Senior counsel, MacArthur Justice Center&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Derick Scruggs, a 30-year-old father and licensed armed security guard, was working in the parking lot of an AutoZone on Chicago’s Southwest Side on April 19, 2021. That’s when he was detained, interrogated, and subjected to a “humiliating body search” by two Chicago police officers, Scruggs later attested. “I was just doing my job when police officers came at me, handcuffed me, and treated me like a criminal—just because I was near a ShotSpotter alert,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The officers found no evidence of a shooting and released Scruggs. But the next day, the police returned and arrested him for an alleged violation related to his security guard paperwork. Prosecutors later dismissed the charges, but he was held in custody overnight and was then fired from his job. “Because of what they did,” he says, “I lost my job, couldn’t work for months, and got evicted from my apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132949" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JonathanM_DSF6795.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jonathan Manes litigated cases related to detentions at Guantanamo Bay and the legality of drone strikes before turning his attention to Chicago’s implementation of gunshot detection technology.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scruggs is believed to be among thousands of Chicagoans who’ve been questioned, detained, or arrested by police because they were near the location of a ShotSpotter alert, according to an analysis by the City of Chicago Office of Inspector General. The case caught the attention of Jonathan Manes, a law professor at Northwestern and senior counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, a public interest law firm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manes previously worked in national security law, but when he joined the justice center about six years ago, he chose to focus squarely on the intersection of civil rights with police surveillance and technology. “My goal was to identify areas that weren’t well covered by other civil rights organizations but were a concern for people here in Chicago,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is a need for much broader structural change to how the city chooses to use surveillance technology and then deploys it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jonathan Manes, senior counsel, MacArthur Justice Center&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And when he and his colleagues looked into ShotSpotter, they revealed a disturbing problem: The system generated alerts that yielded no evidence of gun-­related crimes but were used by police as a pretext for other actions. There seemed to be “a pattern of people being stopped, detained, questioned, sometimes arrested, in response to a ShotSpotter alert—often resulting in charges that have nothing to do with guns,” Manes says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system also directed a “massive number of police deployments onto the South and West Sides of the city,” Manes says. Those regions are home to most of Chicago’s Black and Latino residents. The research showed that 80% of the city’s Black population but only 30% of its white population lived in districts covered by the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Manes brought Scruggs’s case into a lawsuit that he was already developing against the city’s use of ShotSpotter. In late 2025, he and his colleagues reached a settlement that prohibits police officers from doing what they did in Scruggs’s case—stopping or searching people simply because they are near the location of a gunshot detection alert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago had already decommissioned ShotSpotter in 2024, but the agreement will cover any future gunshot detection systems. Manes is carefully watching to see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though Manes is pleased with the settlement, he points out that it narrowly focused on how police resources were used &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the gunshot detection system was operational. “There is a need for much broader structural change to how the city chooses to use surveillance technology and then deploys it,” he adds. He supports laws that require disclosure from local officials and law enforcement about what technologies are being proposed and how civil rights could be affected. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen jurisdictions nationwide have adopted surveillance transparency laws, including San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and New York City. But so far Chicago is not on that list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rod McCullom is a Chicago-based science and technology writer whose focus areas include AI, biometrics, cognition, and the science of crime and violence. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early on the morning of September 2, 2024, a Chicago Transit Authority Blue Line train was the scene of a random and horrific mass shooting. Four people were shot and killed on a westbound train as it approached the suburb of Forest Park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The police swiftly activated a digital dragnet—a surveillance network that connects thousands of cameras in the city.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process began with a quick review of the transit agency’s surveillance cameras, which captured the alleged gunman shooting the victims execution style. Law enforcement followed the suspect, through real-time footage, across the rapid-­transit system. Police officials circulated the images to transit staff and to thousands of officers. An officer in the adjacent suburb of Riverdale recognized the suspect from a previous arrest. By the time he was captured at another train station, just 90&amp;nbsp;minutes after the shooting, authorities already had his name, address, and previous arrest history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Little of this process would come as much surprise to Chicagoans. The city has tens of thousands of surveillance cameras—up to 45,000, by some estimates. That’s among the highest numbers per capita in the US. Chicago boasts one of the largest license plate reader systems in the country, and the ability to access audio and video surveillance from independent agencies such as the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Park District, and the public transportation system as well as many residential and commercial security systems such as Ring doorbell cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement and security advocates say this vast monitoring system protects public safety and works well. But activists and many residents say it’s a surveillance panopticon that creates a chilling effect on behavior and violates guarantees of privacy and free speech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Black and Latino communities in Chicago have historically been targeted by excessive policing and surveillance, says Lance Williams, a scholar of urban violence at Northeastern Illinois University. That scrutiny has created new problems without delivering the promised safety, he suggests. In order to “solve the problem of crime or violence and make these communities safer,” he says, “you have to deal with structural problems,” such as the shortage of livable-wage jobs, affordable housing, and mental-health services across the city.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen some effective pushback against the surveillance. Until recently, for example, the city was the largest customer of ShotSpotter acoustic sensors, which are designed to detect gunfire and alert police. The system was introduced in a small area on the South Side in 2012. By 2018, an area of about 136 square miles—some 60% of the city—was covered by the acoustic surveillance network.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critics questioned ShotSpotter’s effectiveness and objected that the sensors were installed largely in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Those critiques gained urgency with the fatal shooting in March 2021 of a 13-year-old, Adam Toledo, by police responding to a ShotSpotter alert. The tragedy became the touchstone of the #StopShotSpotter protest movement and one of the major issues in Brandon Johnson’s successful mayoral campaign in 2023. When he reached office, Johnson followed through, ending the city’s contract with SoundThinking, the San Francisco Bay Area company behind ShotSpotter. In total, it’s estimated, the city paid more than $53 million for the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment, SoundThinking said that ShotSpotter enables law enforcement “to reach the scene faster, render aid to victims, and locate evidence more effectively.” It said the company “plays no part in the selection of deployment areas” but added: “We believe communities experiencing the highest levels of gun violence deserve the same rapid emergency response as any other neighborhood.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there has been successful resistance to police surveillance in the nation’s third-largest city, there are also countervailing forces: Governments and officials in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs are moving to expand the use of surveillance, also in response to public pressure. Even the victory against acoustic surveillance might be short-lived. Early last year, the city issued a request for proposals for gun violence detection technology.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many people in and around Chicago—digital privacy and surveillance activists, defense attorneys, law enforcement officials, and ordinary citizens—are part of this push and pull. Here are some of their stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Alejandro Ruizesparza and Freddy Martinez&lt;br /&gt;Cofounders, Lucy Parsons Labs&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oak Park, a quiet suburb at Chicago’s western border, is the birthplace of Ernest Hemingway. It includes the world’s largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright–designed buildings and homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the village of Oak Park was also the center of a three-year-long campaign against an unwelcome addition to its manicured lawns and Prairie-style architecture: automated license plate readers from a company called Flock Safety. These are high-speed cameras that automatically scan license plates to look for stolen or wanted vehicles, or for drivers with outstanding warrants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132945" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LPL_DSF7601.jpg?w=2701" width="2701" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Freddy Martinez (left) and Alejandro Ruizesparza (right) direct Lucy Parsons Labs, a charitable organization focused on digital rights.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Oak Park group called Freedom to Thrive—made up of parents, activists, lawyers, data scientists, and many others—suspected that this technology was not a good or equitable addition to their neighborhood. So the group engaged the Chicago-based nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs to help navigate the often intimidating process of requesting license plate reader data under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lucy Parsons Labs, which is named for a turn-of-the-century Chicago labor organizer, investigates technologies such as license plate readers, gunshot detection systems, and police bodycams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LPL provides digital security and public records training to a variety of groups and is frequently called on to help community members audit and analyze surveillance systems that are targeting their neighborhoods. It’s led by two first-­generation Mexican-Americans from the city’s Southwest Side. Alejandro Ruizesparza has a background in community organizing and data science. Freddy Martinez was also a community organizer and has a background in physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group is now approaching its 10th year, but it was an all-volunteer effort until 2022. That’s when LPL received its first unrestricted, multi-year operational grant from a large foundation: the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, known worldwide for its so-called “genius grants.” A grant from the Ford Foundation followed the next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The additional resources—a significant amount compared with the previous all-volunteer budget, acknowledges Ruizesparza—meant the two cofounders and two volunteers became full-time employees. But the group is determined not to become “too comfortable” and lose its edge. There is a tenacity to Lucy Parsons Labs’ work—a “sense of scrappiness,” they say—because “we did so much of this work with no money.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of LPL’s primary strategies is filing extensive FOIA requests for raw data sets of police surveillance. The process can take a while, but it often reveals issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the case of Oak Park, the FOIA requests were just one tool that Freedom to Thrive and LPL used to sort out what was going on. The data revealed that in the first 10 months of operation, the eight Flock license plate readers the town had deployed scanned 3,000,000 plates. But only 42 scans led to an alert—an infinitesimal yield of 0.000014%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the impact was disproportionate. While Oak Park’s population of about 53,000 is only 19% Black, Black drivers made up 85% of those flagged by the Flock cameras, seemingly amplifying what were already concerning racial disparities in the village’s traffic stops. Flock did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We became almost de facto experts in navigating the process and the law. I think that sort of speaks to some of the DIY punk aesthetic.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Freddy Martinez, cofounder, Lucy Parsons Labs&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;LPL brings a mix of radical politics and critical theory to its mission. Most surveillance technologies are “largely extensions of the plantation systems,” says Ruizesparza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison makes sense: Many slaveholding communities required enslaved persons to carry signed documents to leave plantations and wear badges with numbers sewn to their clothing. The group says it aims to empower local communities to push back against biased policing technologies through technical assistance, training, and litigation—and to de­mystify algorithms and surveillance tools in the process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we talk to people, they realize that you don’t need to know how to run a regression to understand that a technology has negative implications on your life,” says Ruizesparza. “You don’t need to understand how circuits work to understand that you probably shouldn’t have all of these cameras embedded in only Black and brown regions of a city.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The group came by some of its techniques through experimentation. “When LPL was first getting started, we didn’t really feel like FOIA would have been a good way of getting information. We didn’t know anything about it,” says Martinez. “Along the way, we were very successful in uncovering a lot of surveillance practices.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the covert surveillance practices uncovered by those aggressive FOIA requests, for example, was the Chicago Police Department’s use of “Stingray” equipment, portable surveillance devices deployed to track and monitor mobile phones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The contentious issue of Oak Park’s license plate readers was finally put to a vote in late August. The village trustees voted 5–2 to terminate the contract with Flock Safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since then, community-­based groups from across the country—as far away as California—have contacted LPL to say the Chicago collective’s work has inspired their own efforts, says Martinez: “We became almost de facto experts in navigating the process and the law. I think that sort of speaks to some of the DIY punk aesthetic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brian Strockis &lt;br /&gt;Chief, Oak Brook Police Department&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you drive about 20 miles west of Chicago, you’ll find Oakbrook Center, one of the nation’s leading luxury shopping destinations. The open-air mall includes Neiman-Marcus, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci and attracts high-end shoppers from across the region. It’s also become a destination for retail theft crews that coordinate “smash and grabs” and often escape with thousands of dollars’ worth of inventory that can be quickly sold, such as sunglasses or luxury handbags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In early December, police say, a Chicago man tried to lead officers on what could have been a dangerous high-speed chase from the mall. Patrol cars raced to the scene. So did a “first responder drone,” built by Flock Safety and deployed by the Oak Brook Police Department. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drone identified the suspect vehicle from the mall parking lot using its license plate reader and snapped high-definition photos that were texted to officers on the ground. The suspect was later tracked to Chicago, where he was arrested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132947" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BrianStorkis_DSF6009.jpg?w=2756" width="2756" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Brian Strockis, chief of the Oak Brook Police Department, led the way in introducing drones as first responders in the state of Illinois.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was the type of outcome that Brian Strockis, chief of the Oak Brook Police Department, hoped for when he pioneered the “drone as first responder,” or DFR, program in Illinois. A longtime member of the force, he joined the department almost 25 years ago as a patrol officer, worked his way up the brass ladder, and was awarded the top job in 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Oak Brook was the first municipality in Illinois to deploy a drone as a first responder. One of the main reasons, says Strockis, was to reduce the number of high-speed chases, which are potentially dangerous to officers, suspects, and civilians. A drone is also a more effective and cost-efficient way to deal with suspects in fleeing vehicles, says Strockis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police say there was the potential for a dangerous high-speed chase. Patrol cars raced to the scene. But the first unit to arrive was a drone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a force multiplier in that we’re able to do more with less,” says the chief, who spoke with me in his office at Oak Brook’s Village Hall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The department’s drone autonomously launches from the roof of the building and responds to about 10 to 12 service calls per day, at speeds up to 45 miles per hour. It arrives at crime scenes before patrol officers in nine out of every 10 cases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next door to Village Hall is the Oak Brook Police Department’s real-time crime center, a large room with two video walls that integrates livestreams from the first-responder drone, handheld drones, traffic cameras, license plate readers, and about a thousand private security cameras. When I visited, the two DFR operators demonstrated how the machine can fly itself or be directed to locations from a destination entered on Google Maps. They sent it off to a nearby forest preserve and then directed it to return to the rooftop base, where it docks automatically, changes batteries, and charges. After the demo, one of the drone operators logged the flight, as required by state law.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Strockis says he is aware of the privacy concerns around using this technology but that protections are in place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, the drone cannot be used for random or mass surveillance, he says, because the camera is always pointed straight ahead during flight and does not angle down until it reaches its desired location. The drone’s payload does not include facial recognition technology, which is restricted by state law, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drone video footage is invaluable, he adds, because “you are seeing the events as they’re transpiring from an angle that you wouldn’t otherwise be privy to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an extra layer of protection for the public as well as for the officers, says the chief: “For every incident that an officer responds to now, you have squad car and bodycam video. You likely have cell-phone video from the public, officers, complainants, from offenders. So adding this element is probably the best video source on a scene that the police are going to anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mark Wallace &lt;br /&gt;Executive director, Citizens to Abolish Red Light Cameras&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mark Wallace wears several hats. By day he is a real estate investor and mortgage lender. But he is probably best known to many Chicagoans—especially across the city’s largely African-American communities on the South and West Sides—as a talk radio host for the station WVON and one of the leading voices against the city’s extensive network of red-light and speed cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the past two decades, city officials have maintained that the cameras—which are officially known as “automated enforcement”—are a crucial safety measure. They are also a substantial revenue stream, generating around $150 million a year and a total of some $2.5 billion since they were installed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132948" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MarkWallace_DSF6241.jpg?w=1567" width="1567" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Urged on by a radio listener, Mark Wallace started organizing against Chicago’s red-light and speed cameras, a substantial revenue stream for the city that has been found to disproportionately burden majority Black and Latino areas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The one thing that the cameras have the ability to do is generate a lot of money,” Wallace says. He describes the tickets as a “cash grab” that disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking 2022 analysis by ProPublica found, in fact, that households in majority Black and Latino zip codes were ticketed at much higher rates than others, in part because the cameras in those areas were more likely to be installed near expressway ramps and on wider streets, which encouraged faster speeds. The tickets, which can quickly rack up late fees, were also found to cause more of a financial burden in such communities, the report found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These were some of the same concerns that many people expressed on the radio and in meetings, Wallace says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chicago’s automated traffic enforcement began in 2003, and it became the most extensive—and most lucrative—such program in the country. About 300 red-light cameras and 200 speed cameras are set up near schools and parks. The cost of the tickets can quickly double if they are not paid or contested—providing a windfall for the city. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wallace began his advocacy against the cameras soon after arriving at the radio station in the early 2010s. A younger listener called in and said, he recalls, “that he enjoyed the information that came from WVON but that we didn’t do anything.” The comment stuck with him, especially in light of WVON’s storied history. The station was closely involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and broadcast Martin Luther King Jr.’s speeches during his Chicago campaign.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wallace hoped to change the caller’s perception about the station. He had firsthand experience with red-light cameras,&amp;nbsp; having been ticketed himself, and decided to take them on as a cause. He scheduled a meeting at his church for a Friday night, promoting it on his show. “More than 300 people showed up,” he remembers, chatting with me in the spacious project studio and office in the basement of his townhouse on the city’s South Side. “That said to me there are a lot of people who see this in­equity and injustice.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wallace began using his platform on WVON—&lt;em&gt;The People’s Show&lt;/em&gt;—to mobilize communities around social and economic justice, and many discussions revolved around the automated enforcement program. The cause gained traction after city and state officials were found to have taken thousands of dollars from technology and surveillance companies to make sure their cameras remained on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wallace and his group, Citizens to Abolish Red Light Cameras, want to repeal the ordinances authorizing the city’s camera programs. That hasn’t happened so far, but political pressure from the group paved the way for a Chicago City Council ordinance that required public meetings before any red-light cameras are installed, removed, or relocated. The group hopes for more restrictions for speed cameras, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It was never about me personally. It was about ensuring that we could demonstrate to people that you have power,” says Wallace. “If you don’t like something, as Barack Obama would say, get a pen and clipboard and go to work to fight to make these changes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Jonathan Manes &lt;br /&gt;Senior counsel, MacArthur Justice Center&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Derick Scruggs, a 30-year-old father and licensed armed security guard, was working in the parking lot of an AutoZone on Chicago’s Southwest Side on April 19, 2021. That’s when he was detained, interrogated, and subjected to a “humiliating body search” by two Chicago police officers, Scruggs later attested. “I was just doing my job when police officers came at me, handcuffed me, and treated me like a criminal—just because I was near a ShotSpotter alert,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The officers found no evidence of a shooting and released Scruggs. But the next day, the police returned and arrested him for an alleged violation related to his security guard paperwork. Prosecutors later dismissed the charges, but he was held in custody overnight and was then fired from his job. “Because of what they did,” he says, “I lost my job, couldn’t work for months, and got evicted from my apartment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1132949" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JonathanM_DSF6795.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jonathan Manes litigated cases related to detentions at Guantanamo Bay and the legality of drone strikes before turning his attention to Chicago’s implementation of gunshot detection technology.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AKILAH TOWNSEND&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scruggs is believed to be among thousands of Chicagoans who’ve been questioned, detained, or arrested by police because they were near the location of a ShotSpotter alert, according to an analysis by the City of Chicago Office of Inspector General. The case caught the attention of Jonathan Manes, a law professor at Northwestern and senior counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, a public interest law firm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manes previously worked in national security law, but when he joined the justice center about six years ago, he chose to focus squarely on the intersection of civil rights with police surveillance and technology. “My goal was to identify areas that weren’t well covered by other civil rights organizations but were a concern for people here in Chicago,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is a need for much broader structural change to how the city chooses to use surveillance technology and then deploys it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Jonathan Manes, senior counsel, MacArthur Justice Center&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And when he and his colleagues looked into ShotSpotter, they revealed a disturbing problem: The system generated alerts that yielded no evidence of gun-­related crimes but were used by police as a pretext for other actions. There seemed to be “a pattern of people being stopped, detained, questioned, sometimes arrested, in response to a ShotSpotter alert—often resulting in charges that have nothing to do with guns,” Manes says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system also directed a “massive number of police deployments onto the South and West Sides of the city,” Manes says. Those regions are home to most of Chicago’s Black and Latino residents. The research showed that 80% of the city’s Black population but only 30% of its white population lived in districts covered by the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Manes brought Scruggs’s case into a lawsuit that he was already developing against the city’s use of ShotSpotter. In late 2025, he and his colleagues reached a settlement that prohibits police officers from doing what they did in Scruggs’s case—stopping or searching people simply because they are near the location of a gunshot detection alert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago had already decommissioned ShotSpotter in 2024, but the agreement will cover any future gunshot detection systems. Manes is carefully watching to see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though Manes is pleased with the settlement, he points out that it narrowly focused on how police resources were used &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the gunshot detection system was operational. “There is a need for much broader structural change to how the city chooses to use surveillance technology and then deploys it,” he adds. He supports laws that require disclosure from local officials and law enforcement about what technologies are being proposed and how civil rights could be affected. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen jurisdictions nationwide have adopted surveillance transparency laws, including San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and New York City. But so far Chicago is not on that list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rod McCullom is a Chicago-based science and technology writer whose focus areas include AI, biometrics, cognition, and the science of crime and violence. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/23/1132740/inside-chicago-surveillance-panopticon/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mastercard’s AI payment demo points to agent-led commerce (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/mastercard-ai-payment-demo-points-to-agent-led-commerce/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A recent demonstration from Mastercard suggests that payment systems may be heading toward a future where software agents, not people, complete purchases. During the India AI Impact Summit 2026, Mastercard showed what it described as its first fully authenticated “agentic commerce” transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the demo, as reported by &lt;em&gt;Times of India&lt;/em&gt;, an AI agent searched for a product, assessed the website, and completed the purchase using stored payment credentials, without the user opening an app or entering card details. The company said the transaction took place inside a secure payment framework designed to verify both the user and the AI acting on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration was controlled, not a public rollout. Mastercard executives told reporters that broader deployment would depend on regulatory approval and ecosystem readiness. Still, the test highlights a change that many enterprises may need to prepare for: the possibility that customers – or corporate systems – will increasingly rely on AI agents to initiate and complete transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Assisted checkout to delegated spending&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital payments have usually focused on reducing friction for human users through tokenisation, saved credentials, and one-click checkout. Agentic commerce goes further. Instead of helping a user complete a purchase, the system allows software to handle the process from start to finish once permission rules are in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model relies on several building blocks already used in modern payments: identity verification, tokenised card data, and risk monitoring. What changes is who performs the action. If AI agents can act in defined limits, like spending caps or merchant restrictions, checkout may change from a user interaction to a background workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the issue is if software can spend money automatically, procurement rules, approval chains, and audit trails need to account for machine decisions, not human ones. Finance teams may need clearer policies on when an AI agent can commit funds, how liability is assigned if something goes wrong, and how fraud detection should treat automated transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Payment networks position for machine customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastercard is not alone in exploring this direction. Across the payments sector, providers are testing ways to embed transactions into AI-driven tools and digital assistants. The goal is to ensure that when autonomous software begins purchasing goods or services, payment networks remain part of the trust and verification layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In public statements tied to the summit demo, Mastercard framed the effort as building infrastructure that allows AI agents to transact safely on behalf of users. That framing points to a broader industry race: not to build smarter AI shopping tools, but to control the authentication systems that make those tools safe enough for financial use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For banks and fintech firms, the change could affect how customer identity is managed. Traditional authentication often assumes a person is present, entering a password or approving a prompt. Agentic commerce assumes the opposite: the user may not be involved at the moment of purchase. That means identity systems must verify both the account owner’s prior consent and the agent’s authority at the time of transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Merchants may need API-ready storefronts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If AI agents begin acting as buyers, merchant systems may also need to adapt. Online stores built mainly for human browsing may struggle if automated agents become a meaningful share of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support machine-driven purchases, product catalogues, pricing data, and checkout processes may need to be accessible through structured APIs not only visual web pages. Inventory accuracy, transparent pricing, and clear return policies become more important when decisions are made by software trained to compare options instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could also influence competition. If agents optimise for price and delivery speed, merchants with inconsistent data or hidden fees may be filtered out before a human even sees them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security risks move, not disappear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While agentic commerce promises convenience, it also introduces new risks. A compromised AI assistant with payment authority could execute purchases at scale before detection. Fraud models that look for unusual user behaviour may need updating to distinguish between legitimate automated spending and malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators are likely to take a cautious approach. Mastercard’s own comments that the system still awaits approvals suggest that compliance frameworks for AI-initiated payments are still taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In enterprises deploying AI internally, similar concerns apply. Automated purchasing agents integrated into enterprise resource planning systems could streamline routine procurement, but they also expand the attack surface. Access controls and spending thresholds will matter more when software can execute financial actions without real-time human confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where commerce may head&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastercard’s demonstration does not mean agent-led payments will reach consumers immediately. Yet it offers a glimpse of how commerce may change as AI systems move from advisory roles into operational ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the model matures, the most visible change may be that checkout disappears as a distinct step. Instead of visiting a site and paying, users or companies may set rules, and their software will handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the important takeaway is less about Mastercard’s AI technology and more about the direction of travel. As AI agents gain the authority to act, payment systems, identity frameworks, and digital storefronts may need to treat software not as a tool, but as a participant in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Cova Software)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Instead of visiting a site and paying, users or companies may set rules, and their software will handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, the important takeaway is less about Mastercard’s AI technology and more about the direction of travel. As AI agents gain the authority to act, payment systems, identity frameworks, and digital storefronts may need to treat software not as a tool, but as a participant in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Cova Software)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

But the stakes are real: A supply chain risk designation would void Anthropic’s contract and force other Pentagon partners to drop Claude entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 14:19:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] How AI agents could destroy the economy (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/how-ai-agents-could-destroy-the-economy/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1167037043-1.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Sunday, an analyst group called Citrini Research published a remarkable piece illustrating how agentic AI could bring on mass economic destruction over the next two years. The scenario imagines a report from two years in the future, in which unemployment has doubled, and the total value of the stock market has fallen by more than a third. As the report puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a negative feedback loop with no natural brake…The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a new kind of bear case, focused not on Skynet-style misalignment but on the gradual unspooling of the economy itself. In particular, the Citrini scenario looks at the implications of integrating AI agents into the economy at large, and what it would mean when outside contractors get replaced by cheaper in-house AI. It’s similar to the Death of SaaS scenario, but Citrini goes further, implicating any business model that involves optimizing transactions between companies.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As you might expect, the report is causing quite a stir online. Not everyone is buying it — even Citrini describes it as more of a scenario than a prediction — but it’s not so easy to name the specific point where you think the scenario goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Personally, I’m not sure companies are ready to hand off purchasing decisions to AI agents, no matter how smart they are. But in Citrini’s scenario, most of the impacted decisions have already been handed off to third-party contractors, so it’s not quite as implausible as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1167037043-1.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On Sunday, an analyst group called Citrini Research published a remarkable piece illustrating how agentic AI could bring on mass economic destruction over the next two years.

          &lt;p&gt;The world’s top AI models can be prompted to generate near-verbatim copies of bestselling novels, raising fresh questions about the industry’s claim that its systems do not store copyrighted works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of recent studies has shown that large language models from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, and xAI memorize far more of their training data than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI and legal experts told the FT this “memorization” ability could have serious ramifications on AI groups’ battle against dozens of copyright lawsuits around the world, as it undermines their core defense that LLMs “learn” from copyrighted works but do not store copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s growing evidence that memorization is a bigger thing than previously believed,” said Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a professor of applied mathematics and computer science at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI groups have long argued that memorization does not happen. In a 2023 letter to the US Copyright Office, Google said “there is no copy of the training data—whether text, images, or other formats—present in the model itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI industry also claims that training models on copyrighted books is “fair use,” arguing that the technology transforms the original work into something meaningfully new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a study published last month showed that researchers at Stanford and Yale Universities were able to strategically prompt LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and xAI to generate thousands of words from 13 books, including &lt;em&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By asking models to complete sentences from a book, Gemini 2.5 regurgitated 76.8 percent of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&lt;/em&gt; with high levels of accuracy, while Grok 3 generated 70.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were also able to extract almost the entirety of the novel “near-verbatim” from Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet by jailbreaking the model, where users can prompt LLMs to disregard their safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

This expands OT and ICS capabilities — but also their exposure to cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional IT environments that manage data and applications, OT systems control real-world processes where cyber incidents can have immediate consequences for safety, availability and operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these systems were originally designed for reliability and longevity, not for today’s threat techniques. This can widen the gap between modern attacks and existing defenses. Even as OT and ICS environments modernize with improved automation, connectivity and analytics, most were not built to withstand adaptive, software-driven cyberattacks that evolve in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is collaborating with leading cybersecurity providers Akamai, Forescout, Palo Alto Networks and Xage Security, as well as industrial automation innovator Siemens, to bring accelerated computing and AI to OT cybersecurity, advancing real-time threat detection and response across critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts represent a fundamental shift in OT and ICS cybersecurity, where security is embedded into and distributed across infrastructure, enforced at the edge and coordinated through centralized, AI-driven intelligence, bringing modern cybersecurity to the systems that keep the physical world running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forescout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and NVIDIA Bring Zero Trust to OT and ICS Environments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero trust is a security model that removes implicit trust from networks. Every user, device and workload must be continuously verified and authorized, regardless of where it originates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While zero trust has been widely adopted to secure enterprise IT environments, applying its principles to OT environments has traditionally been difficult. Legacy devices, proprietary protocols and safety-critical operations limit the use of intrusive controls or AI-driven enforcement, even as increased connectivity to IT and cloud environments expands the attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forescout is working with NVIDIA to make zero trust practical for OT. Forescout provides continuous, agentless discovery and classification of OT, internet of things and IT assets, delivering real-time risk assessment and policy-based enforcement. With deep visibility into network activity, Forescout applies network segmentation to contain lateral movement and enforce zero trust controls precisely where they matter most, without impacting operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the industrial edge, NVIDIA BlueField DPUs run security services on dedicated hardware, keeping protection separate from operational systems so critical processes remain unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Siemens&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palo Alto Networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Embed Security Into Industrial Automation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial automation environments demand consistent performance, low latency and high availability — requirements that traditional IT security tools often struggle to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the S4x26 security conference, Siemens will demonstrate its AI-ready Industrial Automation DataCenter, a unified, holistic solution that consolidates decades of cross-industry automation expertise into one robust IT/OT platform. The future-proof solution contains all the core elements of an edge data center such as computing based on virtualization, data archiving and reporting, resilient disaster recovery solutions, and a robust cybersecurity architecture in accordance with IEC 62443. Through the integration of NVIDIA BlueField, it is uniquely possible to deliver a truly AI-ready, zero-trust solution tailored for the demands on industrial automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma AIRS AI Runtime Security delivers deep visibility into industrial traffic and continuous monitoring for abnormal behavior. By running these security services on NVIDIA BlueField, inspection and enforcement happen directly at the infrastructure level, closer to the workloads. This AI-powered approach strengthens security coverage and drives greater operational uptime where it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Akamai&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Extends Segmentation to OT and ICS With NVIDIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies has extended the Akamai Guardicore Platform to now run on NVIDIA BlueField, enabling agentless segmentation — the ability to isolate applications, devices or workloads into tightly controlled security zones — and the ability to enforce zero-trust policies directly at the edge. This removes the need for agents that may not be compatible with legacy OT systems or safety-certified devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segmentation is enforced at full network speed directly within the infrastructure, without introducing latency or disrupting time-sensitive workloads in centralized data centers or remote edge locations. This helps contain threats quickly, limit their spread and keep mission-critical operations running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Xage Security &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protects the Energy Infrastructure That Powers AI With NVIDIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI scales into a pillar of critical infrastructure, securing the energy systems that power AI factories is as essential as securing the compute itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern energy supply chains are complex, distributed and deeply interconnected with AI operations, and they operate largely within the operational technology domain. In this environment, cyber-physical systems, legacy assets and real-time controls demand security approaches purpose-built for critical infrastructure protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xage Security is working with NVIDIA to help address this need by bringing zero-trust security to both energy infrastructure and the AI systems it supports. At S4x26, Xage will demonstrate a new integration running on NVIDIA BlueField, showing how zero trust enforcement can be embedded directly into energy and AI infrastructure environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xage already protects about 60% of U.S. midstream pipeline infrastructure and works with utilities and energy operators worldwide. By combining Xage’s distributed, identity-based security platform with NVIDIA BlueField, operators can protect energy assets, manage third-party access and secure AI-driven operations at scale without compromising performance, reliability or resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A New Class of OT Cybersecurity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across these environments, a consistent OT cybersecurity architecture is taking shape. Security services run at the edge on NVIDIA BlueField DPUs, close to the operational systems they protect. By executing inspection and enforcement on dedicated, hardware-isolated infrastructure, BlueField enables continuous protection without disrupting time-sensitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OT data generated at the edge is sent to centralized AI factories, where it’s analyzed across many sites to identify patterns, anomalies and emerging threats. In addition, security actions are enforced locally at the edge, while insights are shared centrally — creating a coordinated defense that improves visibility, accelerates response and scales protection consistently across OT and IT environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture helps detect and contain threats faster while strengthening resilience across distributed environments, maintaining consistent performance and protecting uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a new standard for securing critical infrastructure — where AI-driven protection and operational excellence move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA-powered OT cybersecurity solutions are delivered through a global ecosystem of trusted partners. Read this OT cybersecurity use case and solution overview for more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Join &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA at S4x26&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, running Feb. 24–26 in Miami, to see how accelerated computing and AI are transforming cybersecurity for OT and critical infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prompted Playlists allows users to create custom playlists by simply describing what they want to listen to in their own words. Instead of searching for individual songs or artists, users can describe the vibe, scenario, or inspiration they want, and Spotify will take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To access the feature, users tap “Create” and then select “Prompted Playlist,” then enter any prompt in English. The feature is designed to interpret themes including moods, aesthetics, and even memories. Prompts can be as broad or specific as the user wants, referencing musical eras, genres, activities, lyrics, instruments, or even requesting a playlist inspired by a TV show, movie, or personal milestone.&amp;nbsp;Users can also specify whether they want the playlist to include mostly new music or just music from their library in the prompt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once a prompt is submitted, Spotify’s AI generates a customized playlist tailored to the request. The system draws on the user’s listening history and incorporates current music and cultural trends. Plus, each song comes with a short explanation that offers insight into why it was chosen for that particular playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can refine their playlists by adjusting their prompts or starting over. For those whose musical tastes constantly evolve, playlists can be scheduled to automatically refresh on a daily or weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since this is still in beta, Spotify noted that there might be changes as the company gets feedback, and that there are currently usage limits in place. Some users have reported hitting limits after roughly 20 or 30 prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Spotify has recently expanded AI features throughout its platform, including&amp;nbsp;Page Match, which lets users scan a physical book page to jump to the corresponding spot in the audiobook,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;About This Song. The platform also updated its song lyrics feature to provide global translations and offline access.&amp;nbsp;Last week, SeatGeek partnered with Spotify to help listeners easily find ticket links for concerts on an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates within the app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just ahead of its recent Android release, Particle has introduced a feature called Podcast Clips, which finds the most interesting and relevant moments across many different types of podcasts, and then includes those clips alongside the related news stories in its feed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So instead of listening to a lengthy podcast just to catch the 45 seconds of interesting comments, you can play back the clip as you’re reading the news on Particle. You also have the option of reading the transcript of the clip instead, as the words are highlighted as they’re spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095600" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_1093.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve done that basically for any news story — if there is a podcast that is talking about it, or relevant at all, we’ve got all those clips,” Particle CEO Sara Beykpour,&amp;nbsp;previously the Senior Director of Product Management at Twitter, told TechCrunch. “It’s a really cool way, when you’re reading a story or learning about a story, to get a breath of what are people saying about this? What’s the commentary?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The addition acknowledges a shift in the news ecosystem that’s been underway for years. Not only are more people getting their news from podcasts and trusting them as reliable sources, but the medium is also becoming a destination for breaking news and major announcements from public figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech CEOs, in particular, are now seeking out friendly podcast hosts to air their talking points instead of trying to work with traditional media, as Bloomberg reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That makes paying attention to podcasts even more critical if you want to keep up with news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beykpour says Particle uses embedding models to understand when podcasts relate to a given news story. These models are provided by the same companies that provide LLM models, but they’re not generative AI technologies, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We use vector embeddings to understand that these different parts of the podcasts are related to these different stories,” Beykpour notes. “A single podcast might cover 10 or 20 stories, so we use AI to understand that. We also use AI to do some of the logic around clipping, and understanding when to start a clip and end a clip.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095601" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_1092.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company leverages technology from ElevenLabs for transcription. However, some of the technology that identifies where exactly to clip the audio is part of Particle’s secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea to tap into podcasts to better understand the commentary around news is also something newsrooms are taking a closer look at these days. As Nieman Lab reported this month, The New York Times has been using a custom AI tool that employs LLMs to transcribe and summarize new episodes of dozens of right-wing and more conservative podcasts to better understand what influencers on that side are saying about the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Particle’s Podcasts Clips feature isn’t only tied to news stories. Because the app already understands different entities — like people, places or things — you can go to the page for a notable figure, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, to see all of his appearances on podcasts arranged as a feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095602" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_1091.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Particle has been busy building other features, as well. The company has made its first attempt at monetization with Particle+, an optional $2.99/month subscription (or $29.99/year) that lets you access premium features. These include the ability to: use natural language to have the news summarized in a style you prefer; pick from different voices when using the personalized audio feed; “Listen to the News”; unlimited crossword puzzles; support for private questions with its AI chatbot, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095596" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot_20260220-110854.png?w=306" width="306" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Android release also brings a couple of other notable changes. The browse tab now includes timely stories, like the 2026 Winter Olympics, in addition to typical sections like politics, tech, or entertainment. Plus, when you tap on an entity, you’ll see a new page with the definition, stories, articles, related entities, and related topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095595" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/share_6305813549552173171.png?w=306" width="306" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Particle isn’t sharing data about user activity or conversion rates, but Beykpour did point to the app’s international audience, pre-Android. On a weekly basis, 55% of Particle’s users are outside the U.S., with India (15%) its biggest market after the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;An AI news app called Particle, from former Twitter engineers, can now keep up with news breaking on podcasts as well as news published on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just ahead of its recent Android release, Particle has introduced a feature called Podcast Clips, which finds the most interesting and relevant moments across many different types of podcasts, and then includes those clips alongside the related news stories in its feed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So instead of listening to a lengthy podcast just to catch the 45 seconds of interesting comments, you can play back the clip as you’re reading the news on Particle. You also have the option of reading the transcript of the clip instead, as the words are highlighted as they’re spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095600" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_1093.png?w=313" width="313" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Particle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve done that basically for any news story — if there is a podcast that is talking about it, or relevant at all, we’ve got all those clips,” Particle CEO Sara Beykpour,&amp;nbsp;previously the Senior Director of Product Management at Twitter, told TechCrunch. “It’s a really cool way, when you’re reading a story or learning about a story, to get a breath of what are people saying about this? What’s the commentary?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The addition acknowledges a shift in the news ecosystem that’s been underway for years. Not only are more people getting their news from podcasts and trusting them as reliable sources, but the medium is also becoming a destination for breaking news and major announcements from public figures.&lt;/p&gt;

To get stories like this in your inbox first,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign up here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In January, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, the head of the world’s most valuable company, proclaimed that we are entering the era of physical AI, when artificial intelligence will move beyond language and chatbots into physically capable machines. (He also said the same thing the year before, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication—fueled by new demonstrations of humanoid robots putting away dishes or assembling cars—is that mimicking human limbs with single-purpose robot arms is the old way of automation. The new way is to replicate the way humans think, learn, and adapt while they work. The problem is that the lack of transparency about the human labor involved in training and operating such robots leaves the public both misunderstanding what robots can actually do and failing to see the strange new forms of work forming around them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider how, in the AI era, robots often learn from humans who demonstrate how to do a chore. Creating this data at scale is now leading to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;–esque scenarios. A worker in Shanghai, for example, recently spent a week wearing a virtual-reality headset and an exoskeleton while opening and closing the door of a microwave hundreds of times a day to train the robot next to him, &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reported. In North America, the robotics company Figure appears to be planning something similar: It announced in September it would partner with the investment firm Brookfield, which manages 100,000 residential units, to capture “massive amounts” of real-world data “across a variety of household environments.” (Figure did not respond to questions about this effort.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Just as our words became training data for large language models, our movements are now poised to follow the same path. Except this future might leave humans with an even worse deal, and it’s already beginning. The roboticist Aaron Prather told me about recent work with a delivery company that had its workers wear movement-tracking sensors as they moved boxes; the data collected will be used to train robots. The effort to build humanoids will likely require manual laborers to act as data collectors at massive scale. “It’s going to be weird,” Prather says. “No doubts about it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or consider tele-operation. Though the endgame in robotics is a machine that can complete a task on its own, robotics companies employ people to operate their robots remotely. Neo, a $20,000 humanoid robot from the startup 1X, is set to ship to homes this year, but the company’s founder, Bernt Øivind Børnich, told me recently that he’s not committed to any prescribed level of autonomy. If a robot gets stuck, or if the customer wants it to do a tricky task, a tele-operator from the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, will pilot it, looking through its cameras to iron clothes or unload the dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This isn’t inherently harmful—1X gets customer consent before switching into tele-operation mode—but privacy as we know it will not exist in a world where tele-operators are doing chores in your house through a robot. And if home humanoids are not genuinely autonomous, the arrangement is better understood as a form of wage arbitrage that re-creates the dynamics of gig work while, for the first time, allowing physical tasks to be performed wherever labor is cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been down similar roads before. Carrying out “AI-driven” content moderation on social media platforms or assembling training data for AI companies often requires workers in low-wage countries to view disturbing content. And despite claims that AI will soon enough train on its outputs and learn on its own, even the best models require an awful lot of human feedback to work as desired.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These human workforces do not mean that AI is just vaporware. But when they remain invisible, the public consistently overestimates the machines’ actual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s great for investors and hype, but it has consequences for everyone. When Tesla marketed its driver-assistance software as “Autopilot,” for example, it inflated public expectations about what the system could safely do—a distortion a Miami jury recently found contributed to a crash that killed a 22-year-old woman (Tesla was ordered to pay $240 million in damages).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same will be true for humanoid robots. If Huang is right, and physical AI is coming for our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, then the way we describe and scrutinize such technology matters. Yet robotics companies remain as opaque about training and tele-operation as AI firms are about their training data. If that does not change, we risk mistaking concealed human labor for machine intelligence—and seeing far more autonomy than truly exists.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260219_humanoid_algo_hero.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

          &lt;p&gt;Last week’s surprise departure of Phil Spencer from Microsoft led to the promotion of Asha Sharma, who comes to head Microsoft’s gaming division after two years as president of the company’s CoreAI Product group. Despite that recent history, Sharma says in a new interview that she has “no tolerance for bad AI” in game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Variety, Sharma noted that “AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” before adding that “great stories are created by humans.” The interview comes after Sharma promised in an introductory memo: “We will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those statements seem like a clear line in the sand from Sharma against the use of AI tools in Microsoft’s first-party game development, at the very least. But what separates “bad AI” and “soulless AI slop” from “innovative technology” that humans can use to create artful games is a matter of some significant debate in the gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have taken a zero-tolerance approach to the use of generative AI tools in video games. When &lt;em&gt;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&lt;/em&gt; studio Sandfall Interactive&amp;nbsp;admitted to using generative AI for some background assets, for instance, the Indie Game Awards rescinded the company’s honors (the assets were later patched out of the game). And publisher Running with Scissors canceled a planned new game in the &lt;em&gt;Postal&lt;/em&gt; series after being “overwhelmed with negative responses” to a trailer containing elements they said were “very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, game development luminaries like John Carmack have defended AI development tools as “allow[ing] the best to reach even greater heights, while enabling smaller teams to accomplish more, and bring in some completely new creator demographics.” And Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney says requiring developers to disclose their use of AI tools is as relevant as disclosing “what shampoo brand the developer uses,” since “AI will be involved in nearly all future production [of games].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A gaming education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Spencer, who spent years at Microsoft Game Studios before heading Microsoft’s gaming division, Sharma has no professional experience in the video game industry. And her personal experience with Xbox also seems somewhat limited; after sharing her Gamertag on social media over the weekend, curious gamers found that her Xbox play history dates back roughly one month. That’s also in stark contrast to Spencer, who has amassed a score of over 121,000 across decades of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her interview with Variety, Sharma cited 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt; as an example of the kinds of games with “deep emotional resonance” and “a distinct point of view” that she’s looking for from Microsoft. And on social media, Sharma shared her list of the three greatest games ever: “&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Goldeneye&lt;/em&gt;,” for what it’s worth. Sharma also seems to be taking recommendations for games to catch up on; after saying on social media that she would try &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2&lt;/em&gt;, the game appeared in her recently played games over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a personal fan of video games isn’t necessarily required to succeed in running a gaming company. Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi famously didn’t care for video games even as he launched the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System to worldwide success in the 1980s. Still, the lack of direct experience with the gaming world marks a sharp change after Spencer’s long tenure at a time when Microsoft is struggling to redefine the Xbox brand amid cratering hardware sales, a pivot away from software exclusives, and a move to extend the Xbox brand to many different devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox President and COO Sarah Bond, who by all accounts was being set up to succeed Spencer, also announced her departure from Microsoft on Friday, ending a nearly nine-year stint as a public face for the company’s gaming efforts. The Verge reports that Bond caused a lot of friction within the Xbox team when she championed the “Xbox Everywhere” strategy and “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign, which focused on streaming Xbox games to hardware like mobile phones and tablets, according to anonymous sources. Shortly before the launch of that campaign in 2024, Microsoft lost marketing executives Jerrett West and Kareem Choudry, leading to significant internal reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longtime Xbox Game Studios executive Matt Booty, whose history in the game industry dates back to working for Williams Electronics in the ’90s, has been promoted to executive vice president and chief content officer for Xbox and “will continue working closely with [Sharma] to ensure a smooth transition,” Microsoft said in its announcement Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Guide Labs, a San Francisco start-up founded by CEO Julius Adebayo and chief science officer Aya Abdelsalam Ismail, is offering an answer to that problem today. On Monday, the company open-sourced an 8 billion parameter LLM, Steerling-8B, trained with a new architecture designed to make its actions easily interpretable: Every token produced by the model can be traced back to its origins in the LLM’s training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That can as a simple as determining the reference materials for facts cited by the model, or as complex as understanding the model’s understanding of humor or gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If I have a trillion ways to encode gender, and I encode it in 1 billion of the 1 trillion things that I have, you have to make sure you find all those 1 billion things that I’ve encoded, and then you have to be able to reliably turn that on, turn them off,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “You can do it with current models, but it’s very fragile … It’s sort of one of the holy grail questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adebayo began this work while earning his PhD at MIT, co-authoring a widely cited 2018 paper that showed existing methods of understanding deep learning models were not reliable. That work ultimately led to the creation of a new way of building LLMs: Developers insert a concept layer in the model that buckets data into traceable categories. This requires more up front data annotation, but by using other AI models to help, they were able to train this model as their largest proof of concept yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The kind of interpretability people do is…neuroscience on a model, and we flip that,” Adebayo said. “What we do is actually engineer the model from the ground up so that you don’t need to do neuroscience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One concern with this approach is that it might eliminate some of the emergent behaviors that make LLMs so intriguing: Their ability to generalize in new ways about things they haven’t been trained on yet. Adebayo says that still happens in his company’s model: His team tracks what they call “discovered concepts” that the model discovered on its own, like quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adebayo argues this interpretable architecture will be something everyone needs. For consumer-facing LLMs, these techniques should allow model builders to do things like block the use of copyrighted materials, or better control outputs around subjects like violence or drug abuse. Regulated industries will require more controllable LLMs, for example in finance, where a model evaluating loan applicants needs to consider things like financial records but not race. There’s also a need for interpretability in scientific work, another area where Guide Labs has developed technology. Protein folding has been a big success for deep learning models, but scientists need more insight into why their software figured out promising combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This model demonstrates is that training interpretable models is no longer a sort of science; it’s now an engineering problem,” Adebayo said. “We figured out the science and we can scale them, and there is no reason why this kind of model wouldn’t match the performance of the frontier level models,” which have many more parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Guide Labs says that Steerling-8B can achieved 90% of the capability of existing models, but uses less training data, thanks to its novel architecture. The next step for the company, which emerged from Y Combinator and raised a $9 million seed round from Initialized Capital in November 2024, is to build a larger model and begin offering API and agentic access to users. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way we’re current training models is super primitive, and so democratizing inherent interpretability is actually going to be a long term good thing for our role within the human race,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “As we’re going after these models that are going to be super intelligent, you don’t want something to be making decisions on your behalf that’s sort of mysterious to you.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The challenge of wrangling a deep learning model is often understanding why it does what it does: Whether it’s xAI’s repeated struggle sessions to fine-tune Grok’s odd politics, ChatGPT’s struggles with sycophancy, or run-of-the-mill hallucinations, plumbing through a neural network with billions of parameters isn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced on Monday the “Frontier Alliance,” a signal that the AI lab is willing to try different approaches to get enterprises to meaningfully adopt its technology. The alliance includes multi-year partnerships between OpenAI and four major consulting firms, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture and Capgemini, to sell its enterprise products.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s Forward Deployed Engineering team will work with the consulting giants to help them implement OpenAI’s enterprise-focused technologies like OpenAI Frontier into customers’ tech stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company launched OpenAI Frontier in early February. The no-code open software allows users to build, deploy, and manage AI agents both built on OpenAI’s AI models and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI argues in its latest announcement that consultants are the right avenue to get enterprises on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI alone does not drive transformation. It must be linked to strategy, built into redesigned processes, and adopted at scale with aligned incentives and culture to deliver sustained outcomes,” BCG CEO Christoph Schweizer said in OpenAI’s blog post. “Our expanded partnership combines OpenAI’s Frontier platform with BCG’s deep industry, functional, and tech expertise and BCG X’s build-and-scale capabilities to drive measurable impact with safeguards from day one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thus far, enterprise adoption of AI has been relatively slow as these companies struggle to find a meaningful return on investment from their AI pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s alliance strategy makes sense and goes beyond just pitching enterprises on attaching AI to their existing workflows. Instead, this effort focuses on consultants persuading companies to change their strategies and workflows to fold in OpenAI’s tools where it makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting the OpenAI rival Anthropic has inked deals with consulting giants including Deloitte and Accenture in recent months too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Company CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a blog post in January that enterprise is a big area of focus for OpenAI in 2026.

Get shredded? Stay mentally sharp? A wellness influencer might tell you to take peptides, the latest cure-all in the alternative medicine arsenal. People inject them. They snort them. They combine them into concoctions with superhero names, like the Wolverine stack.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt Kaeberlein, a longevity researcher, first started hearing about peptides a few years ago. “At that point it was mostly functional medicine doctors that were using peptides,” he says, referring to physicians who embrace alternative medicine and supplements. “In the last six months, it’s kind of gone crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Peptides have gone mainstream. At the health-technology startup Superpower in Los Angeles, employees can get free peptide shots on Fridays. At a health food store in Phoenix, a sidewalk sign reads, “We have peptides!” At a tae kwon do center in South Carolina, a peptide wholesaler hosts an informational evening. On social media, they’re everywhere. And that popularity seems poised to grow; Department of Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promised to end the FDA’s “aggressive suppression” of peptides.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The benefits and risks of many of these compounds, however, are largely unknown. Some of the most popular peptides have never been tested in human trials. They are sold for research purposes, not human consumption. Some are illegal knockoffs of wildly successful weight-loss medicines. The vast majority come from China, a fact that has some legislators worried. Last week, Senator Tom Cotton urged the head of the FDA to crack down on illegal shipments of peptides from China. In&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the absence of regulatory oversight, some people are sending the compounds they purchase off for independent testing just to ensure that the product is legit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a peptide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A peptide is simply a short string of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. “Scientists generally think of peptides as very small protein fragments, but we don’t really have a precise cutoff between a peptide and a protein,” says Paul Knoepfler, a stem-cell researcher at the University of California, Davis. Insulin is a peptide, as is human growth hormone. So are some neurotransmitters, like oxytocin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But when wellness influencers talk about peptides, they’re often referring to particular compounds—formulated as injections, pills, or nasal sprays—that have become trendy lately.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of these peptides are FDA-approved prescription medications. GLP-1 medicines, for example, are approved to treat diabetes and obesity but are also easily accessible online to almost anyone who wants to use them. Many sites sell microdoses of GLP-1s with claims that they can “support longevity,” reduce cognitive decline, or curb inflammation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many more peptides are experimental. “The majority fall into the unapproved bucket,” says Kaeberlein, who is chief executive officer of Optispan, a Seattle-based health-care technology company focused on longevity. That bucket includes drugs that promote the release of growth hormones, like TB-500, CJC-1295, and ipamorelin, and compounds said to promote tissue repair and wound healing, like BPC-157 and GHK-Cu. It’s primarily these unapproved compounds that have raised concerns. “Anybody can set up an online shop selling research-grade peptides,” says Tenille Davis, a pharmacist and chief advocacy officer at the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, a trade organization representing more than 600 pharmacies. “And nobody knows what’s even in the vials.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just fitness gurus, biohackers, and longevity fanatics who are taking these experimental drugs. Kaeberlein recalls hearing about an acquaintance whose doctor prescribed her unapproved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;peptides. She was “just a typical upper-middle-class woman,” he says. “That’s when it really hit me that this has sort of gone relatively mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do peptides do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All kinds of things, purportedly. GHK-Cu is supposed to help with wound healing and collagen production. BPC-157 is said to promote tissue repair and curb inflammation, TB-500 to foster blood vessel formation. Here’s the caveat: The evidence for these benefits comes largely from animal studies and online testimonials, not human trials. “There’s no human clinical evidence to show that they even do what people are claiming that they do,” says Stuart Phillips, a muscle physiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “So it could be just a giant rip-off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experimental peptides probably do have beneficial wound healing properties or regenerative effects, Kaeberlein says. For BPC-157, for example, “the animal data is compelling,” he says. But there are still plenty of unknowns: What is the right dosage? How long should you take it? What’s the best way to administer it? Those are questions that can be answered only through rigorous clinical trials. In the absence of those studies, doctors “just make up their own protocols,” he says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some consumers go the DIY route, reconstituting powdered peptides and injecting their own concoctions at home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why am I seeing ads for these peptide therapies if they’re not approved?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Federal law prohibits companies from marketing medications that haven’t been approved. That includes most peptides, which are regulated as small molecules, not dietary supplements. (Two notable exceptions are collagen peptides and creatine peptides, often sold as powders.) The law is designed to protect consumers from drugs that haven’t been proved safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t stop labs from making peptides for research purposes. “Most of the peptides being consumed in the marketplace now are being sold by these online companies that are selling them labeled for research use only,” Davis says. The vials often bear disclaimers that clearly say as much: “For research use only”&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;“Not for human consumption.” It’s illegal to market these products for human use, but “the websites make it pretty clear that the buyers are intended to be using these products themselves,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The practice isn’t legal, but enforcement has been sporadic. “FDA sends warning letters, shuts down companies. But because it’s all online, they have a really hard time keeping up with these entities,” Davis says. And companies have plenty of incentive to keep illegally marketing the products. “They can make millions of dollars without having to spend money and time doing research,” Knoepfler says. “It’s a cash grab.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Compounding pharmacies, which are legally allowed to create bespoke medications by mixing bulk active ingredients, often get requests to dispense peptides, but most peptides don’t meet the eligibility criteria for compounding. This has always been the case, but in 2023 the FDA explicitly added several common experimental peptides to the list of bulk substances that cannot be compounded because of safety concerns. “It put an exclamation point on policy that was already in place,” Davis says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many GLP-1 medications are available from compounding pharmacies. That used to be accepted because the drugs were in short supply. Now, however, supplies of most of these medications are stable, and sellers are under increasing pressure from regulators to stop mass-marketing these drugs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the harm in trying them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Peptides sold for research purposes come from labs with little regulatory oversight. “When you buy stuff online intended for research grade, you have no idea what’s in the vial that you’re getting. You have no idea the sterility practices that it was manufactured under, or what sort of impurities might be in the vial,” Davis says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phillips has heard some people say they send their peptides for third-party testing to ensure that they’re pure, “like it’s some kind of flex,” he says. “And I’m like, ‘Well, you just proved that this stuff lives in the shadows, for crying out loud.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finnrick Analytics, a peptide-testing startup in Austin, Texas, has analyzed the purity and potency of more than 5,000 samples of 15 different peptides from 173&amp;nbsp;vendors. The results show that the quality varies substantially from vendor to vendor and even batch to batch. For example, the company tested nearly 450 samples of BPC-157 from 64&amp;nbsp;vendors. In some cases, the vials sold as BPC-157 didn’t contain the compound at all. In those that did, the purity varied from about 82% to 100%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more worrying, 8% of all the peptide samples Finnrick tested had measurable levels of endotoxins, bacterial fragments that can cause fever and chills or, in larger doses, septic shock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The health risks aren’t just hypothetical. In 2025, two women had to be hospitalized and placed on ventilators after receiving peptide injections at a longevity conference in Las Vegas. Both recovered, and it’s still not clear whether they reacted to the peptides themselves or to some impurity in the vials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The idea that all peptides are safe and all peptides are natural is just nonsense,” Kaeberlein says. “I tend to consider myself fairly libertarian when it comes to what people want to do for their health,” he adds. “If you want to take an experimental drug, that’s up to you.” But the problem with unregulated experimental therapies is that it’s exceedingly difficult to assess benefit and harm. “The relatively small percentage of people that are bad actors will be bad actors, and they will dishonestly market this stuff to people who aren’t equipped to really understand the true risks and rewards,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, like any drug, peptides come with a risk of side effects. For approved medications, these are detailed right on the package insert. But for many experimental peptides, there hasn’t been enough research to understand what those side effects might be. Some researchers have warned that peptides that promote growth or blood vessel formation might also foster the growth of cancers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For competitive athletes who use peptides, meanwhile, the risks include not just possible health problems but suspension. Some peptides, like BPC-157, are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The FDA has undergone a pretty substantial overhaul under the Trump administration. Are the regulations around peptides likely to change?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t have a crystal ball, but it seems likely. In May 2025, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joined the longevity enthusiast and biohacker Gary Brecka on his podcast &lt;em&gt;The Ultimate Human&lt;/em&gt; and promised to “end the war at FDA against alternative medicine—the war on stem cells, the war on chelating drugs, the war on peptides.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Knoepfler anticipates that Kennedy will force the FDA to allow compounding of some of the most popular peptides, like BPC-157 and GHK-Cu. “Such a step would put public health at great risk, while giving compounders and likely wellness influencers a lot more profit,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FDA seems intent on cracking down on GLP-1 copycats, however. In early February, commissioner Marty Makary posted on X that the agency would take “swift action against companies mass-marketing illegal copycat drugs, claiming they are similar to FDA-approved products.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/260219_peptides_hero2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt; Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more from the series here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Want to lose weight? Get shredded? Stay mentally sharp? A wellness influencer might tell you to take peptides, the latest cure-all in the alternative medicine arsenal. People inject them. They snort them. They combine them into concoctions with superhero names, like the Wolverine stack.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt Kaeberlein, a longevity researcher, first started hearing about peptides a few years ago. “At that point it was mostly functional medicine doctors that were using peptides,” he says, referring to physicians who embrace alternative medicine and supplements. “In the last six months, it’s kind of gone crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Peptides have gone mainstream. At the health-technology startup Superpower in Los Angeles, employees can get free peptide shots on Fridays. At a health food store in Phoenix, a sidewalk sign reads, “We have peptides!” At a tae kwon do center in South Carolina, a peptide wholesaler hosts an informational evening. On social media, they’re everywhere. And that popularity seems poised to grow; Department of Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promised to end the FDA’s “aggressive suppression” of peptides.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The benefits and risks of many of these compounds, however, are largely unknown. Some of the most popular peptides have never been tested in human trials. They are sold for research purposes, not human consumption. Some are illegal knockoffs of wildly successful weight-loss medicines. The vast majority come from China, a fact that has some legislators worried. Last week, Senator Tom Cotton urged the head of the FDA to crack down on illegal shipments of peptides from China. In&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the absence of regulatory oversight, some people are sending the compounds they purchase off for independent testing just to ensure that the product is legit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a peptide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A peptide is simply a short string of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. “Scientists generally think of peptides as very small protein fragments, but we don’t really have a precise cutoff between a peptide and a protein,” says Paul Knoepfler, a stem-cell researcher at the University of California, Davis. Insulin is a peptide, as is human growth hormone. So are some neurotransmitters, like oxytocin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But when wellness influencers talk about peptides, they’re often referring to particular compounds—formulated as injections, pills, or nasal sprays—that have become trendy lately.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of these peptides are FDA-approved prescription medications. GLP-1 medicines, for example, are approved to treat diabetes and obesity but are also easily accessible online to almost anyone who wants to use them. Many sites sell microdoses of GLP-1s with claims that they can “support longevity,” reduce cognitive decline, or curb inflammation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many more peptides are experimental. “The majority fall into the unapproved bucket,” says Kaeberlein, who is chief executive officer of Optispan, a Seattle-based health-care technology company focused on longevity. That bucket includes drugs that promote the release of growth hormones, like TB-500, CJC-1295, and ipamorelin, and compounds said to promote tissue repair and wound healing, like BPC-157 and GHK-Cu. It’s primarily these unapproved compounds that have raised concerns. “Anybody can set up an online shop selling research-grade peptides,” says Tenille Davis, a pharmacist and chief advocacy officer at the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, a trade organization representing more than 600 pharmacies. “And nobody knows what’s even in the vials.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not just fitness gurus, biohackers, and longevity fanatics who are taking these experimental drugs. Kaeberlein recalls hearing about an acquaintance whose doctor prescribed her unapproved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;peptides. She was “just a typical upper-middle-class woman,” he says. “That’s when it really hit me that this has sort of gone relatively mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do peptides do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All kinds of things, purportedly. GHK-Cu is supposed to help with wound healing and collagen production. BPC-157 is said to promote tissue repair and curb inflammation, TB-500 to foster blood vessel formation. Here’s the caveat: The evidence for these benefits comes largely from animal studies and online testimonials, not human trials. “There’s no human clinical evidence to show that they even do what people are claiming that they do,” says Stuart Phillips, a muscle physiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “So it could be just a giant rip-off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some experimental peptides probably do have beneficial wound healing properties or regenerative effects, Kaeberlein says. For BPC-157, for example, “the animal data is compelling,” he says. But there are still plenty of unknowns: What is the right dosage? How long should you take it? What’s the best way to administer it? Those are questions that can be answered only through rigorous clinical trials. In the absence of those studies, doctors “just make up their own protocols,” he says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some consumers go the DIY route, reconstituting powdered peptides and injecting their own concoctions at home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why am I seeing ads for these peptide therapies if they’re not approved?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Federal law prohibits companies from marketing medications that haven’t been approved. That includes most peptides, which are regulated as small molecules, not dietary supplements. (Two notable exceptions are collagen peptides and creatine peptides, often sold as powders.) The law is designed to protect consumers from drugs that haven’t been proved safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t stop labs from making peptides for research purposes. “Most of the peptides being consumed in the marketplace now are being sold by these online companies that are selling them labeled for research use only,” Davis says. The vials often bear disclaimers that clearly say as much: “For research use only”&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;“Not for human consumption.” It’s illegal to market these products for human use, but “the websites make it pretty clear that the buyers are intended to be using these products themselves,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The practice isn’t legal, but enforcement has been sporadic. “FDA sends warning letters, shuts down companies. But because it’s all online, they have a really hard time keeping up with these entities,” Davis says. And companies have plenty of incentive to keep illegally marketing the products. “They can make millions of dollars without having to spend money and time doing research,” Knoepfler says. “It’s a cash grab.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Compounding pharmacies, which are legally allowed to create bespoke medications by mixing bulk active ingredients, often get requests to dispense peptides, but most peptides don’t meet the eligibility criteria for compounding. This has always been the case, but in 2023 the FDA explicitly added several common experimental peptides to the list of bulk substances that cannot be compounded because of safety concerns. “It put an exclamation point on policy that was already in place,” Davis says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many GLP-1 medications are available from compounding pharmacies. That used to be accepted because the drugs were in short supply. Now, however, supplies of most of these medications are stable, and sellers are under increasing pressure from regulators to stop mass-marketing these drugs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the harm in trying them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Peptides sold for research purposes come from labs with little regulatory oversight. “When you buy stuff online intended for research grade, you have no idea what’s in the vial that you’re getting.
