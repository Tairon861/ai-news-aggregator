&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These emails reportedly announce an immediate “strategic pivot,” with the company deciding to&amp;nbsp; “accelerate the expansion and prioritization of our specialist AI tutors, while scaling back our focus on general AI tutor roles.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As part of this shift in focus, we no longer need most generalist AI tutor positions and your employment with xAI will conclude,” xAI reportedly wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Business Insider, these cuts represent about one-third of xAI’s 1,500-person data annotation team — the team that works to label and prepare data used to train xAI’s chatbot Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When contacted for confirmation, xAI pointed to a statement on X (the Musk-owned social network that it acquired earlier this year) declaring that the company “will immediately surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are hiring across domains like STEM, finance, medicine, safety, and many more,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2207699717.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI laid off 500 team members on Friday night, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
