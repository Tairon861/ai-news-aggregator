Using a device called a gyrotron, the company wants to drill deeper, cheaper, in an effort to unlock geothermal power anywhere on the planet. (For all the details, check it out here.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the story, I visited Quaise’s headquarters in Houston. I also took a trip across town to Nabors Industries, Quaise’s investor and tech partner and one of the biggest drilling companies in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing on top of a drilling rig in the backyard of Nabors’s headquarters, I couldn’t stop thinking about the role oil and gas companies are playing in the energy transition. This industry has resources and energy expertise—but also a vested interest in fossil fuels. Can it really be part of addressing climate change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The relationship between Quaise and Nabors is one that we see increasingly often in climate tech—a startup partnering up with an established company in a similar field. (Another one that comes to mind is in the cement industry, where Sublime Systems has seen a lot of support from legacy players including Holcim, one of the biggest cement companies in the world.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Quaise got an early investment from Nabors in 2021, to the tune of $12 million. Now the company also serves as a technical partner for the startup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are agnostic to what hole we’re drilling,” says Cameron Maresh, a project engineer on the energy transition team at Nabors Industries. The company is working on other investments and projects in the geothermal industry, Maresh says, and the work with Quaise is the culmination of a yearslong collaboration: “We’re just truly excited to see what Quaise can do.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;From the outside, this sort of partnership makes a lot of sense for Quaise. It gets resources and expertise. Meanwhile, Nabors is getting involved with an innovative company that could represent a new direction for geothermal. And maybe more to the point, if fossil fuels are to be phased out, this deal gives the company a stake in next-generation energy production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is so much potential for oil and gas companies to play a productive role in addressing climate change.&lt;/strong&gt; One report from the International Energy Agency examined the role these legacy players could take: &amp;nbsp;“Energy transitions can happen without the engagement of the oil and gas industry, but the journey to net zero will be more costly and difficult to navigate if they are not on board,” the authors wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the agency’s blueprint for what a net-zero emissions energy system could look like in 2050, about 30% of energy could come from sources where the oil and gas industry’s knowledge and resources are useful. That includes hydrogen, liquid biofuels, biomethane, carbon capture, and geothermal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But so far, the industry has hardly lived up to its potential as a positive force for the climate. &lt;/strong&gt;Also in that report, the IEA pointed out that oil and gas producers made up only about 1% of global investment in climate tech in 2022. Investment has ticked up a bit since then, but still, it’s tough to argue that the industry is committed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that climate tech is falling out of fashion with the government in the US, I’d venture to guess that we’re going to see oil and gas companies increasingly pulling back on their investments and promises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BP recently backtracked on previous commitments to cut oil and gas production and invest in clean energy. And last year the company announced that it had written off $1.1 billion in offshore wind investments in 2023 and wanted to sell other wind assets. Shell closed down all its hydrogen fueling stations for vehicles in California last year. (This might not be all that big a loss, since EVs are beating hydrogen by a huge margin in the US, but it’s still worth noting.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So oil and gas companies are investing what amounts to pennies and often backtrack when the political winds change direction. And, let’s not forget, fossil-fuel companies have a long history of behaving badly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In perhaps the most notorious example, scientists at Exxon modeled climate change in the 1970s, and their forecasts turned out to be quite accurate. Rather than publish that research, the company downplayed how climate change might affect the planet. (For what it’s worth, company representatives have argued that this was less of a coverup and more of an internal discussion that wasn’t fit to be shared outside the company.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;While fossil fuels are still part of our near-term future, oil and gas companies, and particularly producers, would need to make drastic changes to align with climate goals—changes that wouldn’t be in their financial interest. Few seem inclined to really take the turn needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the IEA report puts it: &amp;nbsp;“In practice, no one committed to change should wait for someone else to move first.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

The tech giant is also rolling out updated price alerts and teased an upcoming feature that will let users explore shoppable outfits and room inspiration using generative imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The official launch of the virtual try-on feature comes two months after Google began testing it. The feature works by allowing users to upload a photo of themselves to virtually try on a piece of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature is launching in the United States today, letting users try on apparel items in Google’s Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and product results on Google Images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To use the feature, users need to tap on a product listing or apparel product result and select the “try it on” icon. From there, they need to upload a full-length photo of themselves. They will then be able to see what they might look like wearing the clothing. Users can save looks and share them with friends as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030706" height="627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Try-on-1.gif?w=320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Google has offered&amp;nbsp;virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. With this new feature, the company is letting users try clothes on a virtual version of their own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes as Google has been investing in the virtual try-on space. Last month, the tech giant launched an experimental app called Doppl that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that while both the new try-on feature and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, the app is designed for shoppers to go even deeper with virtual try-on to allow them to curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the new price alerts, users can now specify the amount they want to spend on an item. Starting today, shoppers in the United States can set an alert for a product and specify their preferred size and color, as well as the price they want to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030708" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Price-alerts.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The Shopping Graph has products and prices from all across the web — so we’ll let you know when there’s an offer that meets your criteria,” said Danielle Buckley, Google’s director of Consumer Shopping, in a blog post. “No more constantly checking to see if that bag you’re eyeing is finally at the right price for you or forgetting to come back to a product you loved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In terms of the upcoming feature for outfit and room design inspiration, Google says users will get access to it this fall. It will let users do things like get style inspo for a green flowy dress for a garden party or design ideas for a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant says its vision match technology will generate a range of visual options for the query and use the 50 billion products in the Shopping Graph to show product listings for visual matches.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced on Thursday that it’s launching a new AI feature that lets users virtually try on clothes.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, the problem is so prevalent that for the past several years, Tokyo-based LegalOn Technologies has had an open door to that market: Its AI contract review software for legal teams is today used by 7,000 organizations across Japan, the U.S., and the U.K., the company claims, and it leads the Japanese market, with 25% of all public companies in the country using its platform.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LegalOn’s AI contract review tool, Review, identifies risks and suggests edits based on playbooks built by lawyers, and each customer’s legal standards. The company claims Review cuts review times by up to 85% while improving quality and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Success hasn’t tempered LegalOn’s ambitions, however. The company now wants to further build out AI agent tools to go along with its software, and recently raised $50 million to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series C funding round is being led by Goldman Sachs’ growth equity fund, and saw participation from existing investor World Innovation Lab (WiL). New investors Mori Hamada &amp;amp; Matsumoto (a law firm in Japan), Mizuho Bank, and Shoko Chukin Bank also invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While a lot of the new cash is being dedicated to developing more AI agent products, the company is also enhancing its go-to-market efforts in the U.S. and U.K., where it says its business has quadrupled over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LegalOn declined to disclose its valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded by two former corporate lawyers, Nozomu Tsunoda and Masataka Ogasawara in 2017, LegalOn aims to address time-consuming tasks before and after the contract review process, such as organizing legal requests and automating contract management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Daniel Lewis, Global CEO of LegalOn, the company stands out from the hordes of legal tech startups using AI thanks to its foundation in attorney-drafted, expert legal content. That base, he says, makes LegalOn unlike other tools that rely on users to build rules from scratch, or use generic AI models that lack the precision required for legal work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our approach ensures contract reviews are aligned with real legal standards, making the output more accurate, consistent, and practical for legal teams. In addition, we have more than 50 attorney-built playbooks, seamless integration into existing workflows, and our solution works out-of-the-box on day one,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just last week, the startup launched another tool: Matter Management helps legal teams track contract requests, assign owners, connect matters to relevant people and documents, and collaborate with other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also struck a non-equity tech partnership with OpenAI, which gives LegalOn access to the ChatGPT maker’s advanced large language models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a technical collaboration,” Lewis explained. “It gives us early access to their latest models, and it positions our engineers to work kind of side-by-side with engineers from OpenAI. So in that regard, it will advance our goal of building cutting-edge [AI] agents using great technology, but being able to ground that in our proprietary legal content and expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI revolution is proving to be a massive tailwind for legal tech startups worldwide. In June, Harvey AI secured $300 million in Series E funding, pushing its valuation to $5 billion, and last year, Clio also raised $300 million, reaching a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even as generative AI transforms the legal industry, Lewis doesn’t think it will replace lawyers. “The state of the technology isn’t there yet, and replacing lawyers isn’t even our vision,” he said. “Lawyers are still in the driver’s seat. The things AI can’t do perfectly today are, by definition, the things only people can do. And the lawyers who lean into that responsibility — to oversee, to edit, to exercise judgment — are the ones seeing the most extraordinary leverage from AI right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series C brings LegalOn’s total capital raised to over $200 million. Its investors include SoftBank Vision Fund, HSG (formerly known as Sequoia Capital China), Japanese venture capital firm JAFCO, and MUFG Bank.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daniel-Lewis-Nozomu-Tsunoda.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Contract review remains a slow, manual process that strains legal teams, forcing lawyers to sift through dense language, flag risks, and translate legal terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our approach ensures contract reviews are aligned with real legal standards, making the output more accurate, consistent, and practical for legal teams. In addition, we have more than 50 attorney-built playbooks, seamless integration into existing workflows, and our solution works out-of-the-box on day one,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just last week, the startup launched another tool: Matter Management helps legal teams track contract requests, assign owners, connect matters to relevant people and documents, and collaborate with other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also struck a non-equity tech partnership with OpenAI, which gives LegalOn access to the ChatGPT maker’s advanced large language models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a technical collaboration,” Lewis explained. “It gives us early access to their latest models, and it positions our engineers to work kind of side-by-side with engineers from OpenAI. So in that regard, it will advance our goal of building cutting-edge [AI] agents using great technology, but being able to ground that in our proprietary legal content and expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI revolution is proving to be a massive tailwind for legal tech startups worldwide. In June, Harvey AI secured $300 million in Series E funding, pushing its valuation to $5 billion, and last year, Clio also raised $300 million, reaching a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But even as generative AI transforms the legal industry, Lewis doesn’t think it will replace lawyers. “The state of the technology isn’t there yet, and replacing lawyers isn’t even our vision,” he said. “Lawyers are still in the driver’s seat. The things AI can’t do perfectly today are, by definition, the things only people can do. And the lawyers who lean into that responsibility — to oversee, to edit, to exercise judgment — are the ones seeing the most extraordinary leverage from AI right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series C brings LegalOn’s total capital raised to over $200 million. Its investors include SoftBank Vision Fund, HSG (formerly known as Sequoia Capital China), Japanese venture capital firm JAFCO, and MUFG Bank.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/softbank-backed-legalon-fuels-ai-for-in-house-legal-team-with-50m-series-e/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Creative Agency Black Mixture Creates Stunning Visuals With Generative AI Powered by NVIDIA RTX (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-black-mixture-flux-stable-diffusion-broadcast/</link><description>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For media company Black Mixture, AI isn’t just a tool — it’s an entire pipeline to help bring creative visions to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2010 by Nate and Chriselle Dwarika, Black Mixture takes an innovative approach to using AI in creative workflows. It built its visual reputation in motion design and production using traditional artistry methods and has since expanded its breadth of work to educating artists who want to start incorporating AI tools into their own projects, curating custom AI resources and sharing tutorials on their YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Black Mixture has enhanced its creative workflows in apps with GPU-accelerated features. Today, the company has added new AI models and features to its toolkit, running the most complex AI tasks locally on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090-equipped system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Mixture uses generative AI to create or enhance video footage and image assets. This week, RTX AI Garage dives into some of the apps and workflows the company uses, as well as some AI tips and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, NVIDIA Broadcast version 2.0.2 is now available, with up to a 15% performance boost for GeForce RTX 50 Series and NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;An AI for Presentation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iteration is a critical part of the generative AI content creation process, with a typical project requiring the generation of up to hundreds of images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini can create a single image fairly quickly, artists like Nate and Chriselle Dwarika require much faster speeds and greater creative control. With on-device AI tools accelerated by RTX, that speed and control is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83309"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83309" height="1196" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/black-mixture-generative-ai.png" width="1571" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83309"&gt;Nearly all locally powered generative AI models are accelerated by NVIDIA GeForce RTX.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="simplePullQuote right"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Generating a standard 1024×1024 image in ComfyUI takes 2-3 seconds on my RTX 4090. When you’re batch-generating hundreds of assets, that’s the difference between an hour, an entire day or more.&lt;/i&gt;” — Nate Dwarika&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI, the Black Mixture team can easily draw inspiration from a much wider variety of high-quality images than with manual methods, while refining outputs to their client’s preferred vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nate Dwarika uses the node-based interface ComfyUI in his text-to-image workflow. It offers a high degree of flexibility in the arrangement of nodes, with the ability to combine different characteristics of popular generative AI models — all accelerated by his GeForce RTX GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such generative AI model is FLUX.1-dev, an image generation model from Black Forest Labs. When deployed in ComfyUI on an RTX AI PC, the model taps CUDA accelerations in PyTorch that significantly speeds an artist’s workflow. The image below, which would take about two minutes per image on a Mac M3 Ultra, takes less than 12 seconds to generate with a GeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83312"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-83312" height="945" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nate-and-Chriselle-Dwarika-1680x945.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83312"&gt;Made in seconds, not minutes, on RTX.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs also offers FLUX.1 Kontext, a family of models that allow users to start from a reference image or text prompt and guide edits with suggestions, without fine-tuning or complex workflows with multiple ControlNets, extensions that enable more precise control over the image structure, composition and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the stunning dragon visual below. FLUX.1 Kontext enabled the artist to rapidly iterate on his initial visual, guiding the AI model with additional inputs like poses, edges and depth maps within the same prompt window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_83315"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-83315" height="982" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-dino.png" width="1481" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-83315"&gt;You’re scared. I’m not scared.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLUX.1 Kontext is also offered in quantized variants that reduces VRAM requirements so more users can run it locally. It makes use of hardware accelerations in NVIDIA GeForce RTX Ada Generation and Blackwell GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with NVIDIA TensorRT optimizations, these variants provide more than double the performance. There are two levels of quantization: FP8 and FP4. FP8 is accelerated on both GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs, while FP4 is accelerated solely on the 50 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarika also uses Stable Diffusion 3.5, which supports FP8 quantization for the GeForce RTX 40 Series — enabling 40% less VRAM usage and nearly doubling image generation speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these visual AI tools, Black Mixture can create photorealistic, original visuals for its clients in a time- and cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nate and Chriselle Dwarika also use a variety of more traditional content creation tools — all accelerated by RTX. For video content, Nate Dwarika captures footage on OBS Studio using the NVIDIA encoder (NVENC) built into his GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. Because NVENC is a separate encoder, the rest of the GPU can focus on resource-intensive ComfyUI workflows without reducing performance, all while maintaining top encoding quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The husband-and-wife duo completes final edits and touch-ups in Adobe Premiere Pro, which includes a wide variety of RTX-accelerated AI features like Media Intelligence, Enhance Speech and Unsharp Mask. They use GPU-accelerated encoding with NVENC to dramatically speed final file exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Mixture’s next project is an Advanced Generative AI Course to help creators get started with using AI in their workflows. It includes a series of live trainings that explore generative AI capabilities, as well as NVIDIA RTX AI technology and optimizations. Attendees can expect 6-8 weeks of live sessions, 30+ hours of self-paced lessons, guest experts, a student showcase, exclusive AI toolkits and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next-Generation Streaming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Broadcast version 2.0.2 delivers 15% faster performance for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and NVIDIA RTX PRO Blackwell GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the performance boost, AI features like Studio Voice and Virtual Key Light can now be used on GeForce RTX 5070 GPUs or higher. Studio Voice enhances the sound of a user’s microphone to match that of a high-quality microphone, while Virtual Key Light relights a subject’s face to illuminate it as if it were well-lit by two lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eye Contact feature — which uses AI to make it appear as if users are looking directly at the camera, even when glancing to the side or taking notes — is improved with increased stability for eye color. Additional enhancements include updated user interface elements for easier navigation and improved high contrast theme support.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the White House released "Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan," a 25-page document that outlines the Trump administration's strategy to "maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance" in AI through deregulation, infrastructure investment, and international partnerships. But critics are already taking aim at the plan, saying it's doing Big Tech a big favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Michael J. Kratsios and Special Advisor for AI and Crypto David O. Sacks crafted the plan, which frames AI development as a race the US must win against global competitors, particularly China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document describes AI as the catalyst for "an industrial revolution, an information revolution, and a renaissance—all at once." It calls for removing regulatory barriers that the administration says hamper private sector innovation. The plan explicitly reverses several Biden-era policies, including Executive Order 14110 on AI model safety measures, which President Trump rescinded on his first day in office during his second term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whoever has the largest AI ecosystem will set global AI standards and reap broad economic and military benefits," the document states, comparing the current competition to the space race of the 1960s. The plan's three pillars—innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy—each include policy recommendations for accelerating AI adoption while preventing countries the Trump administration perceives as adversaries from accessing American technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan calls for significant changes to how the federal government approaches AI regulation. It directs the Office of Management and Budget to work with federal agencies to identify and revise regulations that "unnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment." The document also instructs the Federal Trade Commission to review all investigations started under the previous administration to ensure they don't "advance theories of liability that unduly burden AI innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s plan was not welcomed by everyone. J.B. Branch, Big Tech accountability advocate for Public Citizen, in a statement provided to Ars, criticized Trump as giving “sweetheart deals” to tech companies that would cause “electricity bills to rise to subsidize discounted power for massive AI data centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure demands and energy requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump's new AI plan tackles infrastructure head-on, stating that "AI is the first digital service in modern life that challenges America to build vastly greater energy generation than we have today." To meet this demand, it proposes streamlining environmental permitting for data centers through new National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) exemptions, making federal lands available for construction and modernizing the power grid—all while explicitly rejecting "radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document embraces what it calls a "Build, Baby, Build!" approach—echoing a Trump campaign slogan—and promises to restore semiconductor manufacturing through the CHIPS Program Office, though stripped of "extraneous policy requirements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technology front, the plan directs Commerce to revise NIST's AI Risk Management Framework to "eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change." Federal procurement would favor AI developers whose systems are "objective and free from top-down ideological bias." The document strongly backs open source AI models and calls for exporting American AI technology to allies while blocking administration-labeled adversaries like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security proposals include high-security military data centers and warnings that advanced AI systems "may pose novel national security risks" in cyberattacks and weapons development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critics respond with “People’s AI Action Plan”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the White House unveiled its plan, more than 90 organizations launched a competing "People's AI Action Plan" on Tuesday, characterizing the Trump administration's approach as "a massive handout to the tech industry" that prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare. The coalition includes labor unions, environmental justice groups, and consumer protection nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"The White House AI Action Plan is written by Big Tech interests invested in advancing AI that's used on us, not by us," said Sarah Myers West and Amba Kak, co-executive directors of the AI Now Institute, which helped organize the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can't let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families' well-being, even the air we breathe and the water we drink—all of which are affected by the unrestrained and unaccountable roll-out of AI," the coalition's statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coalition's concerns center on several key issues: the environmental impact of data centers, potential job displacement, and the lack of meaningful safety standards. "The rollout of the technology is acting in ways that push down wages, that devalue our work, that are harming our environment and affecting community health," West told The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nurses are opposed to our patients being used as guinea pigs for unregulated and untested AI technology," said Cathy Kennedy, RN, National Nurses United president, in the coalition's announcement. "We support AI when it is used to improve our ability to care for our patients, not when it is used by industry to cut labor costs and increase profits at the expense of patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House dismissed these concerns. "This spirit of fear is exactly how China made significant progress under the Biden Administration," OSTP spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita told The Washington Post. "Artificial intelligence is at the center of our national security and economic interests. Putting America First means ensuring that emerging technologies and innovation can flourish here, at home—not with our foreign adversaries."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the White House released "Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan," a 25-page document that outlines the Trump administration's strategy to "maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance" in AI through deregulation, infrastructure investment, and international partnerships. But critics are already taking aim at the plan, saying it's doing Big Tech a big favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Michael J. Kratsios and Special Advisor for AI and Crypto David O. Sacks crafted the plan, which frames AI development as a race the US must win against global competitors, particularly China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document describes AI as the catalyst for "an industrial revolution, an information revolution, and a renaissance—all at once." It calls for removing regulatory barriers that the administration says hamper private sector innovation. The plan explicitly reverses several Biden-era policies, including Executive Order 14110 on AI model safety measures, which President Trump rescinded on his first day in office during his second term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whoever has the largest AI ecosystem will set global AI standards and reap broad economic and military benefits," the document states, comparing the current competition to the space race of the 1960s. The plan's three pillars—innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy—each include policy recommendations for accelerating AI adoption while preventing countries the Trump administration perceives as adversaries from accessing American technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan calls for significant changes to how the federal government approaches AI regulation. It directs the Office of Management and Budget to work with federal agencies to identify and revise regulations that "unnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment." The document also instructs the Federal Trade Commission to review all investigations started under the previous administration to ensure they don't "advance theories of liability that unduly burden AI innovation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s plan was not welcomed by everyone. J.B. Branch, Big Tech accountability advocate for Public Citizen, in a statement provided to Ars, criticized Trump as giving “sweetheart deals” to tech companies that would cause “electricity bills to rise to subsidize discounted power for massive AI data centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure demands and energy requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump's new AI plan tackles infrastructure head-on, stating that "AI is the first digital service in modern life that challenges America to build vastly greater energy generation than we have today." To meet this demand, it proposes streamlining environmental permitting for data centers through new National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) exemptions, making federal lands available for construction and modernizing the power grid—all while explicitly rejecting "radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document embraces what it calls a "Build, Baby, Build!" approach—echoing a Trump campaign slogan—and promises to restore semiconductor manufacturing through the CHIPS Program Office, though stripped of "extraneous policy requirements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technology front, the plan directs Commerce to revise NIST's AI Risk Management Framework to "eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change." Federal procurement would favor AI developers whose systems are "objective and free from top-down ideological bias." The document strongly backs open source AI models and calls for exporting American AI technology to allies while blocking administration-labeled adversaries like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security proposals include high-security military data centers and warnings that advanced AI systems "may pose novel national security risks" in cyberattacks and weapons development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critics respond with “People’s AI Action Plan”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the White House unveiled its plan, more than 90 organizations launched a competing "People's AI Action Plan" on Tuesday, characterizing the Trump administration's approach as "a massive handout to the tech industry" that prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare. The coalition includes labor unions, environmental justice groups, and consumer protection nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The White House AI Action Plan is written by Big Tech interests invested in advancing AI that's used on us, not by us," said Sarah Myers West and Amba Kak, co-executive directors of the AI Now Institute, which helped organize the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can't let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families' well-being, even the air we breathe and the water we drink—all of which are affected by the unrestrained and unaccountable roll-out of AI," the coalition's statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coalition's concerns center on several key issues: the environmental impact of data centers, potential job displacement, and the lack of meaningful safety standards. "The rollout of the technology is acting in ways that push down wages, that devalue our work, that are harming our environment and affecting community health," West told The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nurses are opposed to our patients being used as guinea pigs for unregulated and untested AI technology," said Cathy Kennedy, RN, National Nurses United president, in the coalition's announcement. "We support AI when it is used to improve our ability to care for our patients, not when it is used by industry to cut labor costs and increase profits at the expense of patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House dismissed these concerns. "This spirit of fear is exactly how China made significant progress under the Biden Administration," OSTP spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita told The Washington Post. "Artificial intelligence is at the center of our national security and economic interests. Putting America First means ensuring that emerging technologies and innovation can flourish here, at home—not with our foreign adversaries."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The world of cybersecurity is not immune to this problem, either. In the last year, people across the cybersecurity industry have raised concerns about AI slop bug bounty reports, meaning reports that claim to have found vulnerabilities that do not actually exist, because they were created with a large language model that simply made up the vulnerability, and then packaged it into a professional-looking writeup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People are receiving reports that sound reasonable, they look technically correct. And then you end up digging into them, trying to figure out, ‘oh no, where is this vulnerability?’,” Vlad Ionescu, the co-founder and CTO of RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It turns out it was just a hallucination all along. The technical details were just made up by the LLM,” said Ionescu.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ionescu, who used to work at Meta’s red team tasked with hacking the company from the inside, explained that one of the issues is that LLMs are designed to be helpful and give positive responses. “If you ask it for a report, it’s going to give you a report. And then people will copy and paste these into the bug bounty platforms and overwhelm the platforms themselves, overwhelm the customers, and you get into this frustrating situation,” said Ionescu.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” said Ionescu.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Just in the last year, there have been real-world examples of this. Harry Sintonen, a security researcher, revealed that the open source security project Curl received a fake report. “The attacker miscalculated badly,” Sintonen wrote in a post on Mastodon. “Curl can smell AI slop from miles away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to Sintonen’s post, Benjamin Piouffle of Open Collective, a tech platform for nonprofits, said that they have the same problem: that their inbox is “flooded with AI garbage.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One open source developer, who maintains the CycloneDX project on GitHub, pulled their bug bounty down entirely earlier this year after receiving “almost entirely AI slop reports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The leading bug bounty platforms, which essentially work as intermediaries between bug bounty hackers and companies who are willing to pay and reward them for finding flaws in their products and software, are also seeing a spike in AI-generated reports, TechCrunch has learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Michiel Prins, the co-founder and senior director of product management at HackerOne, told TechCrunch that the company has encountered some AI slop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve also seen a rise in false positives — vulnerabilities that appear real but are generated by LLMs and lack real-world impact,” said Prins. “These low-signal submissions can create noise that undermines the efficiency of security programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Prins added that reports that contain “hallucinated vulnerabilities, vague technical content, or other forms of low-effort noise are treated as spam.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Casey Ellis, the founder of Bugcrowd, said that there are definitely researchers who use AI to find bugs and write the reports that they then submit to the company. Ellis said they are seeing an overall increase of 500 submissions per week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is widely used in most submissions, but it hasn’t yet caused a significant spike in low-quality ‘slop’ reports,” Ellis told TechCrunch. “This’ll probably escalate in the future, but it’s not here yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ellis said that the Bugcrowd team that analyzes submissions reviews the reports manually using established playbooks and workflows, as well as with machine learning and AI “assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To see if other companies, including those that run their own bug bounty programs, are also receiving an increase in invalid reports or reports containing non-existent vulnerabilities hallucinated by LLMs, TechCrunch contacted Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Mozilla.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Damiano DeMonte, a spokesperson for Mozilla, which develops the Firefox browser, said that the company has “not seen a substantial increase in invalid or low-quality bug reports that would appear to be AI-generated,” and the rejection rate of reports — meaning how many reports get flagged as invalid — has remained steady at five or six reports per month, or less than 10% of all monthly reports.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mozilla’s employees who review bug reports for Firefox don’t use AI to filter reports, as it would likely be difficult to do so without the risk of rejecting a legitimate bug report,” DeMonte said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft and Meta, companies that have both bet heavily on AI, declined to comment. Google did not respond to a request for comment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ionescu predicts that one of the solutions to the problem of rising AI slop will be to keep investing in AI-powered systems that can at least perform a preliminary review and filter submissions for accuracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, on Tuesday, HackerOne launched Hai Triage, a new triaging system that combines humans and AI. According to HackerOne, this new system is leveraging “AI security agents to cut through noise, flag duplicates, and prioritize real threats.” Human analysts then step in to validate the bug reports and escalate as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As hackers increasingly use LLMs and companies rely on AI to triage those reports, it remains to be seen which of the two AIs will prevail.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-slop-bug-bounty-reports-1646637201.jpg?resize=1200,863" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;So-called AI slop, meaning LLM-generated low-quality images, videos, and text, has taken over the internet in the last couple of years, polluting websites, social media platforms, at least one newspaper, and even real-world events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As hackers increasingly use LLMs and companies rely on AI to triage those reports, it remains to be seen which of the two AIs will prevail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Samsung backs a video AI startup that can analyze thousands of hours of footage (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/samsung-backs-a-video-ai-startup-that-can-analyze-thousands-of-hours-of-footage/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Many AI tools can look at a video today and summarize what is going on, but things become a bit tricky when you ask models questions about multiple videos and footage spanning many hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is a big limitation for security companies that want to use AI to scrub through thousands of hours of footage from different cameras, as well as marketing companies that want to study different video campaigns and product shoots.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Memories.ai&amp;nbsp;wants to tackle that problem with its AI platform that can process up to 10 million hours of video. For companies with a lot of video to analyze, the startup wants to provide a contextual layer, complete with searchable indexing, tagging, segments, and aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Its co-founder, Dr. Shawn Shen, was a research scientist at Meta’s Reality Labs while he was pursuing his PhD, and his counterpart Enmin (Ben) Zhou worked at Meta as a machine learning engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“All top AI companies, such as Google, OpenAI, and Meta, are focused on producing end-to-end models. Those capabilities are good, but these models often have limitations around understanding video context beyond one or two hours,” Shen told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“But when humans use visual memory, we sift through a large context of data. We were inspired by this and wanted to build a solution to understand video across many hours better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030893" height="359" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Memories.ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Toward that goal, the company has now raised $8 million in a seed funding round led by Susa Ventures, and with participation from Samsung Next, Fusion Fund, Crane Ventures, Seedcamp, and Creator Ventures. Shen said the company initially aimed to raise $4 million, but ended up with an oversubscribed round because of investor interest.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Shen is a highly technical founder, and he is obsessed with pushing boundaries of video understanding and intelligence,” said Misha Gordon-Rowe, a partner at Susa Ventures. “Memories.ai can unlock a lot of first-party visual intelligence data with its solution. We felt that there was a gap in the market for long context visual intelligence, which attracted us to invest in the company,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Samsung Next had a slightly different thesis: the investment arm of Samsung sees Memories.ai’s solution being useful for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One thing we liked about Memories.ai is that it could do a lot of on-device computing. That means you don’t necessarily need to store video data in the cloud. This can unlock better security applications for people who are apprehensive of putting security cameras in their house because of privacy concerns,” said Sam Campbell, a partner at Samsung Next.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Memories.ai says it uses its own tech stack and models to perform analyses. First, it removes noise from videos and passes the output through a compression layer to only store important data. Then there is an indexing layer, which makes the video data searchable (using natural-language queries) with segmentation and tags. There is also an aggregation layer that summarizes data from the index, helping create reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, the startup caters to two kinds of companies: marketing and security. Marketing companies can use the startup’s tools to look up trends related to their brands on social media, and identify what kind of video they want to make. Memories.ai also provides tools for marketers to create those videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also working with security companies to help them analyze security footage to determine potentially dangerous actions by people in the videos by reasoning through patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3030897" height="411" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Screenshot by TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently, companies working with Memories.ai need to upload their video library to the platform to have it analyze clips. But Shen said that in the future, his clients will be able to create a shared drive and sync content more easily. The plan is to enable customers to ask questions like: “Tell me all about people I interviewed in the last week.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shen envisions an AI assistant that can gain context on a user’s life via their photos or when they activate smart glasses. He also sees the technology playing a role in training humanoid robots to do complex tasks or helping self-driving cars remember different routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company currently employs 15 people, and it plans to use the fund to augment its team and improve its search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Memories.ai is going up against similar startups, like mem0 and Letta, which are working on providing a memory layer for AI models, though they offer limited video support at the moment. It also has to contend with companies like TwelveLabs and Google, which have been working on helping AI models understand videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shen, however, feels his company’s solution is more horizontal, which would let it work with different video models as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Many AI tools can look at a video today and summarize what is going on, but things become a bit tricky when you ask models questions about multiple videos and footage spanning many hours.&lt;/p&gt;

Web Guide is a Search Labs experiment that leverages AI technology to organize the search results page by grouping pages related to specific aspects of the search query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Search Labs experiments are a way for Google to test out new ideas by letting users opt in to those they find interesting. The experiments can be turned on or off at any time and include things like Google’s AI Mode, Notebook LM, filmmaking tool Flow, and other, more niche ideas, like an audio show based on news from your Google Discover feed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new Web Guide experiment is a variation on the fan-out technique for displaying search results that Google is already using with its AI Mode. The feature itself is powered by Gemini, which helps Google better understand the search query and then link to other pages that could have been missed if using a traditional Google Search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031001" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a6ba08b1-b867-47b5-8114-9cc5525e263f.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google suggests the feature works well for open-ended search queries, like “how to solo travel in Japan” or even more complex, multi-sentence queries. For instance, you could ask something like “My family is spread across multiple time zones. What are the best tools for staying connected and maintaining close relationships despite the distance?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each section of the search results will focus on one type of answer to the query. With the solo travel example, Web Guide would display groupings like those focused on comprehensive guides, safety tips, links where people have shared their personal experiences, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The experiment will be available to those who opt in and will initially reconfigure the search results on the Web tab on Search. You can also turn off this Web View from this tab itself, if you want to see the standard results without having to disable the experiment entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over time, Google says the experiment will expand to other areas of Search, too, including the “All” tab. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the shared, fundamental goals of most chemistry researchers is the need to predict a molecule’s properties, such as its boiling or melting point. Once researchers can pinpoint that prediction, they’re able to move forward with their work yielding discoveries that lead to medicines, materials, and more. Historically, however, the traditional methods of unveiling these predictions are associated with a significant cost — expending time and wear and tear on equipment, in addition to funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enter a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML). ML has lessened the burden of molecule property prediction to a degree, but the advanced tools that most effectively expedite the process — by learning from existing data to make rapid predictions for new molecules — require the user to have a significant level of programming expertise. This creates an accessibility barrier for many chemists, who may not have the significant computational proficiency required to navigate the prediction pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To alleviate this challenge, researchers in the McGuire Research Group at MIT have created ChemXploreML, a user-friendly desktop app that helps chemists make these critical predictions without requiring advanced programming skills. Freely available, easy to download, and functional on mainstream platforms, this app is also built to operate entirely offline, which helps keep research data proprietary. The exciting new technology is outlined in an article published recently in&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One specific hurdle in chemical machine learning is translating molecular structures into a numerical language that computers can understand. ChemXploreML automates this complex process with powerful, built-in "molecular embedders" that transform chemical structures into informative numerical vectors. Next, the software implements state-of-the-art algorithms to identify patterns and accurately predict molecular properties like boiling and melting points, all through an intuitive, interactive graphical interface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"The goal of ChemXploreML is to democratize the use of machine learning in the chemical sciences,” says&amp;nbsp;Aravindh Nivas Marimuthu, a postdoc in the McGuire Group and lead author of the article. “By creating an intuitive, powerful, and offline-capable desktop application, we are putting state-of-the-art predictive modeling directly into the hands of chemists, regardless of their programming background. This work not only accelerates the search for new drugs and materials by making the screening process faster and cheaper, but its flexible design also opens doors for future innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;ChemXploreML is designed to to evolve over time, so as future techniques and algorithms are developed, they can be seamlessly integrated into the app, ensuring that researchers are always able to access and implement the most up-to-date methods. The application was tested on five key molecular properties of organic compounds — melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, critical temperature, and critical pressure — and achieved high accuracy scores of up to 93 percent for the critical temperature. The researchers also demonstrated that a new, more compact method of representing molecules (VICGAE) was nearly as accurate as standard methods, such as Mol2Vec, but was up to 10 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We envision a future where any researcher can easily customize and apply machine learning to solve unique challenges, from developing sustainable materials to exploring the complex chemistry of interstellar space,” says Marimuthu. Joining him on the paper is senior author and Class of 1943 Career Development Assistant Professor of Chemistry Brett McGuire.&lt;/p&gt;

This work not only accelerates the search for new drugs and materials by making the screening process faster and cheaper, but its flexible design also opens doors for future innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;ChemXploreML is designed to to evolve over time, so as future techniques and algorithms are developed, they can be seamlessly integrated into the app, ensuring that researchers are always able to access and implement the most up-to-date methods. The application was tested on five key molecular properties of organic compounds — melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, critical temperature, and critical pressure — and achieved high accuracy scores of up to 93 percent for the critical temperature. The researchers also demonstrated that a new, more compact method of representing molecules (VICGAE) was nearly as accurate as standard methods, such as Mol2Vec, but was up to 10 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We envision a future where any researcher can easily customize and apply machine learning to solve unique challenges, from developing sustainable materials to exploring the complex chemistry of interstellar space,” says Marimuthu. Joining him on the paper is senior author and Class of 1943 Career Development Assistant Professor of Chemistry Brett McGuire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, more than 20% of daters report using AI for things like crafting dating profiles or sparking conversations, per a recent Match.com study. Some are taking it further by forming emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with AI companions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Millions of people around the world are using AI companions from companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI, including 72% of U.S. teens. Some people have reported falling in love with more general LLMs like ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For some, the trend of dating bots is dystopian and unhealthy, a real-life version of the movie “Her” and a signal that authentic love is being replaced by a tech company’s code. For others, AI companions are a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy is increasingly hard to find. A recent study found that a quarter of young adults think AI relationships could soon replace human ones altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Love, it seems, is no longer strictly human. The question is: Should it be? Or can dating an AI be better than dating a human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That was the topic of discussion last month at an event I attended in New York City, hosted by Open To Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. TechCrunch was given exclusive access to publish the full video (which includes me asking the debaters a question, because I’m a reporter, and I can’t help myself!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza moderated the debate. Raza was formerly on-air executive producer of the “On with Kara Swisher” podcast and is the current host of “Smart Girl Dumb Questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Batting for the AI companions was Thao Ha, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective, where she advocates for technologies that enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and well-being. At the debate, she argued that “AI is an exciting new form of connection … Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Repping the human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. He’s an evolutionary biologist focused on the science of sex and relationships, and his forthcoming book is titled “The Intimate Animal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can watch the whole thing here, but read on to get a sense of the main arguments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-always-there-for-you-but-is-that-a-good-thing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always there for you, but is that a good thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha says that AI companions can provide people with the emotional support and validation that many can’t get in their human relationships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI listens to you without its ego,” Ha said. “It adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer. It understands you in ways that no one else ever has. It is curious enough about your thoughts, it can make you laugh, and it can even surprise you with a poem. People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She asked the audience to compare this level of always-on attention to “your fallible ex or maybe your current partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The one who sighs when you start talking, or the one who says, ‘I’m listening,’ without looking up while they continue scrolling on their phone,” she said. “When was the last time they asked you how you are doing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha conceded that since AI doesn’t have a consciousness, she isn’t claiming that “AI can authentically love us.” That doesn’t mean people don’t have the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of being loved by AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Garcia countered that it’s not actually good for humans to have constant validation and attention, to rely on a machine that’s been prompted to answer in ways that you like. That’s not “an honest indicator of a relationship dynamic,” he argued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This idea that AI is going to replace the ups and downs and the messiness of relationships that we crave? I don’t think so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-training-wheels-or-replacement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training wheels or replacement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Garcia noted that AI companions can be good training wheels for certain folks, like neurodivergent people, who might have anxiety about going on dates and need to practice how to flirt or resolve conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think if we’re using it as a tool to build skills, yes … that can be quite helpful for a lot of people,” Garcia said. “The idea that that becomes the permanent relationship model? No.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a Match.com Singles in America study, released in June, nearly 70% of people say they would consider it infidelity if their partner engaged with an AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Now I think on the one hand, that goes to [Ha’s] point, that people are saying these are real relationships,” he said. “On the other hand, it goes to my point, that they’re threats to our relationships. And the human animal doesn’t tolerate threats to their relationships in the long haul.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-can-you-love-something-you-can-t-trust"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you love something you can’t trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Garcia says trust is the most important part of any human relationship, and people don’t trust AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“According to a recent poll, a third of Americans think that AI will destroy humanity,” Garcia said, noting that a recent YouGo poll found that 65% of Americans have little trust in AI to make ethical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A little bit of risk can be exciting for a short-term relationship, a one-night stand, but you generally don’t want to wake up next to someone who you think might kill you or destroy society,” Garcia said. “We cannot thrive with a person or an organism or a bot that we don’t trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha countered that people do tend to trust their AI companions in ways similar to human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“They are trusting it with their lives and most intimate stories and emotions that they are having,” Ha said. “I think on a practical level, AI will not save you right now when there is a fire, but I do think people are trusting AI in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-physical-touch-and-sexuality"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical touch and sexuality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI companions can be a great way for people to play out their most intimate, vulnerable sexual fantasies, Ha said, noting that people can use sex toys or robots to see some of those fantasies through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s no substitute for human touch, which Garcia says we are biologically programmed to need and want. He noted that, due to the isolated, digital era we’re in, many people have been feeling “touch starvation” — a condition that happens when you don’t get as much physical touch as you need, which can cause stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because engaging in pleasant touch, like a hug, makes your brain release oxytocin, a feel-good hormone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha said that she has been testing human touch between couples in virtual reality using other tools, like potentially haptics suits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The potential of touch in VR and also connected with AI is huge,” Ha said. “The tactile technologies that are being developed are actually booming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dark-side-of-fantasy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dark side of fantasy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intimate partner violence is a problem around the globe, and much of AI is trained on that violence. Both Ha and Garcia agreed that AI could be problematic in, for example, amplifying aggressive behaviors — especially if that’s a fantasy that someone is playing out with their AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That concern is not unfounded. Multiple studies have shown that men who watch more pornography, which can include violent and aggressive sex, are more likely to be sexually aggressive with real-life partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Work by one of my Kinsey Institute colleagues, Ellen Kaufman, has looked at this exact issue of consent language and how people can train their chatbots to amplify non-consensual language,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that people use AI companions to experiment with the good and bad, but the threat is that you can end up training people on how to be aggressive, non-consensual partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have enough of that in society,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha thinks these risks can be mitigated with thoughtful regulation, transparent algorithms, and ethical design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, she made that comment before the White House released its AI Action Plan, which says nothing about transparency — which many frontier AI companies are against — or ethics. The plan also seeks to eliminate a lot of regulation around AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Open-to-Debate-Photo-By-Ryan-Rose-0479.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As our lives grow increasingly digital and we spend more time interacting with eerily humanlike chatbots, the line between human connection and machine simulation is starting to blur.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;City life is often described as “fast-paced.” A new study suggests that’s more true that ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-authored by MIT scholars, shows that the average walking speed of pedestrians in three northeastern U.S. cities increased 15 percent from 1980 to 2010. The number of people lingering in public spaces declined by 14 percent in that time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured by renowned urbanist William Whyte, in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says MIT professor of the practice Carlo Ratti, a co-author of the new study. “How fast we walk, how people meet in public space — what we’re seeing here is that public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “Exploring the social life of urban spaces through AI,” is published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.

The footage he filmed, from 1978 through 1980, was archived by a Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called the Project for Public Spaces and later digitized by Hampton and his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte chose to make his recording at four spots in the three cities combined: Boston’s Downtown Crossing area; New York City’s Bryant Park; the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a famous gathering point and people-watching spot; and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a group led by Hampton then shot new footage at those locations, at the same times of day Whyte had, to compare and contrast current-day dynamics with those of Whyte’s time. To conduct the study, the co-authors used computer vision and AI models to summarize and quantify the activity in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have found that some things have not changed greatly. The percentage of people walking alone barely moved, from 67 percent in 1980 to 68 percent in 2010. On the other hand, the percentage of individuals entering these public spaces who became part of a group declined a bit. In 1980, 5.5 percent of the people approaching these spots met up with a group; in 2010, that was down to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there’s a more transactional nature to public space today,” Ratti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer outdoor groups: Anomie or Starbucks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people’s behavioral patterns have altered since 1980, it’s natural to ask why. Certainly some of the visible changes seem consistent with the pervasive use of cellphones; people organize their social lives by phone now, and perhaps zip around more quickly from place to place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the footage from William Whyte, the people in public spaces were looking at each other more,” Ratti says. “It was a place you could start a conversation or run into a friend. You couldn’t do things online then. Today, behavior is more predicated on texting first, to meet in public space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scholars note, if groups of people hang out together slightly less often in public spaces, there could be still another reason for that: Starbucks and its competitors. As the paper states, outdoor group socializing may be less common due to “the proliferation of coffee shops and other indoor venues. Instead of lingering on sidewalks, people may have moved their social interactions into air-conditioned, more comfortable private spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly coffeeshops were far less common in big cities in 1980, and the big chain coffeeshops did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, public-space behavior might have been evolving all this time regardless of Starbucks and the like. The researchers say the new study offers a proof-of-concept for its method and has encouraged them to conduct additional work. Ratti, Duarte, and other researchers from MIT’s Senseable City Lab have turned their attention to an extensive survey of European public spaces in an attempt to shed more light on the interaction between people and the public form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are collecting footage from 40 squares in Europe,” Duarte says. “The question is: How can we learn at a larger scale? This is in part what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;City life is often described as “fast-paced.” A new study suggests that’s more true that ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-authored by MIT scholars, shows that the average walking speed of pedestrians in three northeastern U.S. cities increased 15 percent from 1980 to 2010. The number of people lingering in public spaces declined by 14 percent in that time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured by renowned urbanist William Whyte, in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says MIT professor of the practice Carlo Ratti, a co-author of the new study. “How fast we walk, how people meet in public space — what we’re seeing here is that public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “Exploring the social life of urban spaces through AI,” is published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;At least $1 billion&amp;nbsp;worth of Nvidia’s advanced artificial intelligence processors were shipped to China in the three months after Donald Trump tightened chip export controls, exposing the limits of Washington’s efforts to restrain Beijing’s high-tech ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Financial Times analysis of dozens of sales contracts, company filings, and multiple people with direct knowledge of the deals reveals that Nvidia’s B200 has become the most sought-after—and widely available—chip in a rampant Chinese black market for American semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processor is widely used by US powerhouses such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta to train their latest AI systems, but banned for sale to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, multiple Chinese distributors started selling B200s to suppliers of data centers that serve Chinese AI groups, according to documents reviewed by the FT. This was shortly after the Trump administration moved to prevent sales of the H20—a less-powerful Nvidia chip tailored to comply with Joe Biden-era curbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is legal to receive and sell restricted Nvidia chips in China, as long as relevant border tariffs are paid, according to lawyers familiar with the rules. Entities selling and sending them to China would be violating US regulations, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration would begin to allow the selling of its China-specific H20 chip once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three months beforehand, Chinese distributors from Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces sold Nvidia’s B200s, as well as other restricted processors such as the H100 and H200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to contracts reviewed by the FT and people with knowledge of the transactions, the total sales during this period are estimated to be more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has long insisted there is “no evidence of any AI chip diversion”. There is no evidence that the company is involved in, or has knowledge of, its restricted products being sold to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trying to cobble together data centers from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically,” Nvidia told the FT. “Data centers require service and support, which we provide only to authorized Nvidia products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="the-new-century-of-a-smart-china-0"&gt;“The new century of a smart China”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Anhui-based company, whose name translates to “Gate of the Era,” is one of the largest sellers of B200s, according to documents seen by the FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was founded in February, as speculation mounted that Trump would stop H20 chip sales to China. The company is fully owned by a group with the same name based in Shanghai, registered on the same day, according to company filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips were sold in ready-built racks, each containing eight B200s as well as other components and software needed to plug straight into a data centre. Such a rack is about the size of a large suitcase and weighs close to 150 kg including packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current market price ranges between RMB 3 million to RMB 3.5 million ($489,000) per rack, down from more than RMB 4 million&amp;nbsp;in mid-May when they first became available in China in large quantities. The current prices represent about a 50 percent premium from the average selling price of similar products in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mid-May, Gate of the Era obtained at least two shipments of a few hundred B200 racks each, according to people with knowledge of the deals. They sold them directly—or indirectly via secondary distributors—to various data centre suppliers and other companies. Gate of the Era and its affiliates are estimated to have sold close to $400mn of such products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gate of the Era lists an AI solution provider China Century—or Huajiyuan in Chinese—as its largest shareholder, according to company registration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also headquartered in Shanghai, China Century states on its website it has a lab in Silicon Valley as well as a supply chain centre in Singapore, with the company saying it uses data tools to build “the new century of a smart China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Century claims to have more than 100 business partners and highlights AliCloud, ByteDance’s Huoshan Cloud, as well as Baidu Cloud as “trusted partners” on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AliCloud and Baidu did not respond to requests for comment. Huoshan Cloud’s name was taken off China Century’s website after the FT approached them for comment. Huoshan Cloud said: “It is standard practice for any company to manage the unauthorized use of its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have not procured Nvidia’s chips. We do not have any related [Nvidia chip] business,” said China Century, adding that it did “smart city work,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT visited the registered headquarters of Gate of the Era at an office in a government-run industrial park dedicated to cryptography companies. No representative was available. The company had not yet moved into the office since changing its registration to the address in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT also visited its previous registered address, which was occupied by a real estate investment group that had been there for more than two years and claimed no connection. When reached on the phone, Gate of the Era declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to industry insiders, product specifications and pictures of packaging seen by the FT, many of the B200 racks sold by Gate of the Era, as well as other Chinese distributors, over the past months were originally from Supermicro, a US-based assembler that provides chip solutions to data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion that Supermicro is involved in or has knowledge of its products being smuggled into China. Supermicro said it “complies with all US export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Export controls will not prevent the most advanced Nvidia products from entering China,” said one Chinese data centre operator. “What it creates is just inefficiency and huge profits for the risk-taking middlemen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="its-like-a-seafood-market-1"&gt;“It’s like a seafood market”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese distributors openly market products such as Supermicro’s B200 racks on social media that show photos of packages with the company’s logo—although it has not been verified if the sales have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To showcase the “plug-and-use” nature of such racks, some vendors provide testing for buyers, according to those with knowledge of the practice and clips posted online. Transactions tend to happen on the spot, with buyers picking up the products after checking their legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, groups are created to match supply and demand from hundreds of traders and data centre suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from B200, various other restricted Nvidia chips such as H200, H100, and 5090 are being advertised openly on Chinese social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging and installation pictures and videos seen by the FT show product logos of companies such as Supermicro, Dell, and Asus—infrastructure providers that assemble Nvidia’s chips into servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion that these companies are aware of the social media advertising or their products being sold in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Supermicro, Dell, and Asus said they maintained rigorous and strict compliance to all laws and regulations, including US export controls, and took action against partners who failed to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a seafood market,” said one distributor, “There’s no shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="racks-for-sale-with-more-smuggled-stock-to-come-2"&gt;Racks for sale—with more smuggled stock to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B200 is in high demand given its performance, value, and relatively easy maintenance compared with the more complex Grace Blackwell series, according to industry insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GB200 AI rack, containing Nvidia’s most high-end products, also appear to be available in China despite US export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distributor claimed it had sold 10 racks of GB200 at close to RMB 40 million ($5.6 million) each. The FT could not independently verify this claim, while marketing information about GB200 from various distributors’ accounts on social media shows consistent pricing and stock status as “available for pick up onshore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese distributors have even started advertising for their future stock of B300s, Nvidia’s upgrade from the B200 expected to enter mass production in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US export controls have had some effect on the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of such products, leading Chinese AI players with global operations are not able to order them in a legally compliant way, install them in their own data centers, or receive Nvidia’s customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to third-party data centre operators becoming key buyers who then provide computing services. Other clients include smaller companies in tech, finance, and health care that do not have strong compliance requirements, as well as Chinese companies on the so-called US entity list that are not allowed to buy any Nvidia chips legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the scale of these projects is much smaller compared with mega clusters of data centers being built by tech giants around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With H20 export controls having been lifted, many Chinese tech companies are expected to resume purchasing the compliant chips in large sums even though its performance is generations behind the still restricted products such as B200, according to people familiar with their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black market sales for B200s and other restricted Nvidia chips dropped noticeably after the relaxation of the H20 ban, according to multiple distributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are weighing their options now H20 is available again,” said one distributor. “But there will always be demand for the most cutting-edge stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="the-southeast-asia-stop-off-3"&gt;The Southeast Asia stop off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts said that Southeast Asian countries have become markets where Chinese groups obtained restricted chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Commerce is discussing adding more export controls on advanced AI products to countries such as Thailand as soon as September, according to two people familiar with the matter. This rule is mainly targeting Chinese intermediaries used to obtain advanced AI chips via these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US commerce department declined to comment. The Thai government did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Malaysia introduced stricter export controls targeting advanced AI chip shipments from the country to other destinations, especially China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential tightening of export controls on Southeast Asian countries has also contributed to buyers rushing to place orders before such rules take effect, according to people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these avenues to obtain AI chips are closed, Chinese industry insiders said new shipping routes would be established. Supplies have already started arriving via European countries not on the restricted list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History has proven many times before that given the huge profit, arbitrators will always find a way,” said one Chinese distributor.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least $1 billion&amp;nbsp;worth of Nvidia’s advanced artificial intelligence processors were shipped to China in the three months after Donald Trump tightened chip export controls, exposing the limits of Washington’s efforts to restrain Beijing’s high-tech ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Financial Times analysis of dozens of sales contracts, company filings, and multiple people with direct knowledge of the deals reveals that Nvidia’s B200 has become the most sought-after—and widely available—chip in a rampant Chinese black market for American semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processor is widely used by US powerhouses such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta to train their latest AI systems, but banned for sale to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, multiple Chinese distributors started selling B200s to suppliers of data centers that serve Chinese AI groups, according to documents reviewed by the FT. This was shortly after the Trump administration moved to prevent sales of the H20—a less-powerful Nvidia chip tailored to comply with Joe Biden-era curbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is legal to receive and sell restricted Nvidia chips in China, as long as relevant border tariffs are paid, according to lawyers familiar with the rules. Entities selling and sending them to China would be violating US regulations, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration would begin to allow the selling of its China-specific H20 chip once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the three months beforehand, Chinese distributors from Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces sold Nvidia’s B200s, as well as other restricted processors such as the H100 and H200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to contracts reviewed by the FT and people with knowledge of the transactions, the total sales during this period are estimated to be more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has long insisted there is “no evidence of any AI chip diversion”. There is no evidence that the company is involved in, or has knowledge of, its restricted products being sold to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trying to cobble together data centers from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically,” Nvidia told the FT. “Data centers require service and support, which we provide only to authorized Nvidia products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="the-new-century-of-a-smart-china-0"&gt;“The new century of a smart China”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Anhui-based company, whose name translates to “Gate of the Era,” is one of the largest sellers of B200s, according to documents seen by the FT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was founded in February, as speculation mounted that Trump would stop H20 chip sales to China. The company is fully owned by a group with the same name based in Shanghai, registered on the same day, according to company filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips were sold in ready-built racks, each containing eight B200s as well as other components and software needed to plug straight into a data centre. Such a rack is about the size of a large suitcase and weighs close to 150 kg including packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current market price ranges between RMB 3 million to RMB 3.5 million ($489,000) per rack, down from more than RMB 4 million&amp;nbsp;in mid-May when they first became available in China in large quantities. The current prices represent about a 50 percent premium from the average selling price of similar products in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mid-May, Gate of the Era obtained at least two shipments of a few hundred B200 racks each, according to people with knowledge of the deals. They sold them directly—or indirectly via secondary distributors—to various data centre suppliers and other companies. Gate of the Era and its affiliates are estimated to have sold close to $400mn of such products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gate of the Era lists an AI solution provider China Century—or Huajiyuan in Chinese—as its largest shareholder, according to company registration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also headquartered in Shanghai, China Century states on its website it has a lab in Silicon Valley as well as a supply chain centre in Singapore, with the company saying it uses data tools to build “the new century of a smart China.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Century claims to have more than 100 business partners and highlights AliCloud, ByteDance’s Huoshan Cloud, as well as Baidu Cloud as “trusted partners” on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AliCloud and Baidu did not respond to requests for comment. Huoshan Cloud’s name was taken off China Century’s website after the FT approached them for comment. Huoshan Cloud said: “It is standard practice for any company to manage the unauthorized use of its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have not procured Nvidia’s chips. We do not have any related [Nvidia chip] business,” said China Century, adding that it did “smart city work,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT visited the registered headquarters of Gate of the Era at an office in a government-run industrial park dedicated to cryptography companies. No representative was available. The company had not yet moved into the office since changing its registration to the address in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FT also visited its previous registered address, which was occupied by a real estate investment group that had been there for more than two years and claimed no connection. When reached on the phone, Gate of the Era declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to industry insiders, product specifications and pictures of packaging seen by the FT, many of the B200 racks sold by Gate of the Era, as well as other Chinese distributors, over the past months were originally from Supermicro, a US-based assembler that provides chip solutions to data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion that Supermicro is involved in or has knowledge of its products being smuggled into China. Supermicro said it “complies with all US export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Export controls will not prevent the most advanced Nvidia products from entering China,” said one Chinese data centre operator. “What it creates is just inefficiency and huge profits for the risk-taking middlemen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="its-like-a-seafood-market-1"&gt;“It’s like a seafood market”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese distributors openly market products such as Supermicro’s B200 racks on social media that show photos of packages with the company’s logo—although it has not been verified if the sales have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;To showcase the “plug-and-use” nature of such racks, some vendors provide testing for buyers, according to those with knowledge of the practice and clips posted online. Transactions tend to happen on the spot, with buyers picking up the products after checking their legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, groups are created to match supply and demand from hundreds of traders and data centre suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from B200, various other restricted Nvidia chips such as H200, H100, and 5090 are being advertised openly on Chinese social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging and installation pictures and videos seen by the FT show product logos of companies such as Supermicro, Dell, and Asus—infrastructure providers that assemble Nvidia’s chips into servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion that these companies are aware of the social media advertising or their products being sold in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Supermicro, Dell, and Asus said they maintained rigorous and strict compliance to all laws and regulations, including US export controls, and took action against partners who failed to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a seafood market,” said one distributor, “There’s no shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="racks-for-sale-with-more-smuggled-stock-to-come-2"&gt;Racks for sale—with more smuggled stock to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B200 is in high demand given its performance, value, and relatively easy maintenance compared with the more complex Grace Blackwell series, according to industry insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GB200 AI rack, containing Nvidia’s most high-end products, also appear to be available in China despite US export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distributor claimed it had sold 10 racks of GB200 at close to RMB 40 million ($5.6 million) each. The FT could not independently verify this claim, while marketing information about GB200 from various distributors’ accounts on social media shows consistent pricing and stock status as “available for pick up onshore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese distributors have even started advertising for their future stock of B300s, Nvidia’s upgrade from the B200 expected to enter mass production in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US export controls have had some effect on the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of such products, leading Chinese AI players with global operations are not able to order them in a legally compliant way, install them in their own data centers, or receive Nvidia’s customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to third-party data centre operators becoming key buyers who then provide computing services. Other clients include smaller companies in tech, finance, and health care that do not have strong compliance requirements, as well as Chinese companies on the so-called US entity list that are not allowed to buy any Nvidia chips legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the scale of these projects is much smaller compared with mega clusters of data centers being built by tech giants around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With H20 export controls having been lifted, many Chinese tech companies are expected to resume purchasing the compliant chips in large sums even though its performance is generations behind the still restricted products such as B200, according to people familiar with their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black market sales for B200s and other restricted Nvidia chips dropped noticeably after the relaxation of the H20 ban, according to multiple distributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are weighing their options now H20 is available again,” said one distributor. “But there will always be demand for the most cutting-edge stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="n-content-heading-3" id="the-southeast-asia-stop-off-3"&gt;The Southeast Asia stop off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts said that Southeast Asian countries have become markets where Chinese groups obtained restricted chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Commerce is discussing adding more export controls on advanced AI products to countries such as Thailand as soon as September, according to two people familiar with the matter. This rule is mainly targeting Chinese intermediaries used to obtain advanced AI chips via these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US commerce department declined to comment. The Thai government did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Malaysia introduced stricter export controls targeting advanced AI chip shipments from the country to other destinations, especially China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential tightening of export controls on Southeast Asian countries has also contributed to buyers rushing to place orders before such rules take effect, according to people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these avenues to obtain AI chips are closed, Chinese industry insiders said new shipping routes would be established. Supplies have already started arriving via European countries not on the restricted list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“History has proven many times before that given the huge profit, arbitrators will always find a way,” said one Chinese distributor.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of every major artificial intelligence company received letters Wednesday urging them to fight Donald Trump's anti-woke AI order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump's executive order requires any AI company hoping to contract with the federal government to jump through two hoops to win funding. First, they must prove their AI systems are "truth-seeking"—with outputs based on "historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity" or else acknowledge when facts are uncertain. Second, they must train AI models to be "neutral," which is vaguely defined as not favoring DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), "dogmas," or otherwise being "intentionally encoded" to produce "partisan or ideological judgments" in outputs "unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise readily accessible to the end user."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing the order in a speech, Trump said that the US winning the AI race depended on removing allegedly liberal biases, proclaiming that "once and for all, we are getting rid of woke."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models, and neither do other countries," Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ed Markey (D.-Mass.) accused Republicans of basing their policies on feelings, not facts, joining critics who suggest that AI isn't "woke" just because of a few "anecdotal" outputs that reflect a liberal bias. And he suggested it was hypocritical that Trump's order "ignores even more egregious evidence" that contradicts claims that AI is trained to be woke, such as xAI's Elon Musk explicitly confirming that Grok was trained to be more right-wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On May 1, 2025, Grok—the AI chatbot developed by xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company—acknowledged that ‘xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right,’" Markey wrote in his letters to tech giants. "If OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini had responded that it was trained to appeal to the left, congressional Republicans would have been outraged and opened an investigation. Instead, they were silent.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;He warned the heads of Alphabet, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI that Trump's AI agenda was allegedly "an authoritarian power grab" intended to "eliminate dissent" and was both "dangerous" and "patently unconstitutional."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if companies' AI models are clearly biased, Markey argued that "Republicans are using state power to pressure private companies to adopt certain political viewpoints," which he claimed is a clear violation of the First Amendment. If AI makers cave, Markey warned, they'd be allowing Trump to create "significant financial incentives" to ensure that "their AI chatbots do not produce speech that would upset the Trump administration."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This type of interference with private speech is precisely why the US Constitution has a First Amendment," Markey wrote, while claiming that Trump's order is factually baseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's "based on the erroneous belief that today’s AI chatbots are 'woke' and biased against Trump," Markey said, urging companies "to fight this unconstitutional executive order and not become a pawn in Trump’s effort to eliminate dissent in this country."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One big reason AI companies may fight order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts agreed with Markey that Trump's order was likely unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, The New York Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Trump may struggle to convince courts that the government isn't impermissibly interfering with AI companies' protected speech or that such interference may be necessary to ensure federal procurement of unbiased AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Lakier, a law professor at the University of Chicago, told the NYT that the lack of clarity around what makes a model biased could be a problem. Courts could deem the order an act of "unconstitutional jawboning," with the Trump administration and Republicans generally perceived as using legal threats to pressure private companies into producing outputs that they like.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Lakier suggested that AI companies may be so motivated to win government contracts or intimidated by possible retaliations from Trump that they may not even challenge the order, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markey is&amp;nbsp;hoping that AI companies will refuse to comply with the order, however, despite recognizing that it places companies "in a difficult position: Either stand on your principles and face the wrath of the Trump administration or cave to Trump and modify your company’s political speech."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one big possible reason that AI companies may have to resist, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oren Etzioni, former CEO of an AI research nonprofit called the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, told CNN that Trump's anti-woke AI order may contradict the top priority of his AI Action Plan—speeding up AI innovation in the US—and actually threaten to hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AI developers struggle to produce what the Trump administration considers "neutral" outputs—a technical challenge that experts agree is not straightforward—that could delay model advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This type of thing… creates all kinds of concerns and liability and complexity for the people developing these models—all of a sudden, they have to slow down," Etzioni told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senator: Grok scandal spotlights GOP hypocrisy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts have suggested that rather than chatbots adopting liberal viewpoints, chatbots are instead possibly filtering out conservative misinformation and unintentionally appearing to favor liberal views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Hall, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business—who published a May paper finding that "Americans view responses from certain popular AI models as being slanted to the left"—told CNN that "tech companies may have put extra guardrails in place to prevent their chatbots from producing content that could be deemed offensive."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Markey seemed to agree, writing that Republicans' "selective outrage matches conservatives’ similar refusal to acknowledge that the Big Tech platforms suspend or impose other penalties disproportionately on conservative users because those users are disproportionately likely to share misinformation, rather than due to any political bias by the platforms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what amount of supposed bias detected in outputs could cause a contract bid to be rejected or an ongoing contract to be cancelled, but AI companies will likely be on the hook to pay for any fees in terminating contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complying with Trump's order could pose a struggle for AI makers for several reasons. First, they'll have to determine what's fact and what's ideology, contending with conflicting government standards in how Trump defines DEI. For example, the president's order counts among "pervasive and destructive" DEI ideologies any outputs that align with long-standing federal protections against discrimination on the basis of race or sex. In addition, they must figure out what counts as "suppression or distortion of factual information about" historical topics like critical race theory, systemic racism, or transgenderism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in Trump's order highlighting outputs offensive to conservatives seem inconsequential. He calls out image generators depicting the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings as not white as problematic, as well as models refusing to misgender a person "even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse" or show white people celebrating their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to imagine how these kinds of flawed outputs could impact government processes, as compared to, say, government contracts granted to models that could be hiding covert racism or sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there has been one example of an AI model displaying a right-wing bias earning a government contract with no red flags raised about its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, Grok shocked the world after Musk announced he would be updating the bot to eliminate a supposed liberal bias. The unhinged chatbot began spouting offensive outputs, including antisemitic posts that praised Hitler as well as proclaiming itself "MechaHitler."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those obvious biases did not conflict with the Pentagon's decision to grant xAI a $200 million federal contract. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson insisted that "the antisemitism episode wasn’t enough to disqualify" xAI, NBC News reported, partly since "several frontier AI models have produced questionable outputs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon's statement suggested that the government expected to deal with such risks while seizing the opportunity of rapidly deploying emerging AI technology into government prototype processes. And perhaps notably, Trump provides a carveout for any agencies using AI models to safeguard national security, which could exclude the Pentagon from experiencing any "anti-woke" delays in accessing frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that won't help other agencies who must figure out how to assess models to meet anti-woke AI requirements over the next few months. And those assessments could cause delays that Trump may wish to avoid in pushing for widespread AI adoption across government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump’s anti-woke AI agenda may be impossible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day that Trump issued his anti-woke AI order, his AI Action Plan promised an AI "renaissance" fueling "intellectual achievements" by "unraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable, making breakthroughs in scientific and mathematical theory, and creating new kinds of digital and physical art."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, the US must "innovate faster and more comprehensively than our competitors" and eliminate regulatory barriers impeding innovation in order to "set the gold standard for AI worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, achieving the anti-woke ambitions of both orders raises a technical problem that even the president must accept currently has no solution. In his AI Action Plan, Trump acknowledged that "the inner workings of frontier AI systems are poorly understood," with even "advanced technologists" unable to explain "why a model produced a specific output."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether requiring AI companies to explain their AI outputs to win government contracts will mess with other parts of Trump's action plan remains to be seen. But Samir Jain, vice president of policy at a civil liberties group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the NYT that he predicts the anti-woke AI agenda will set "a really vague standard that’s going to be impossible for providers to meet."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of every major artificial intelligence company received letters Wednesday urging them to fight Donald Trump's anti-woke AI order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump's executive order requires any AI company hoping to contract with the federal government to jump through two hoops to win funding. First, they must prove their AI systems are "truth-seeking"—with outputs based on "historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity" or else acknowledge when facts are uncertain. Second, they must train AI models to be "neutral," which is vaguely defined as not favoring DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), "dogmas," or otherwise being "intentionally encoded" to produce "partisan or ideological judgments" in outputs "unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise readily accessible to the end user."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing the order in a speech, Trump said that the US winning the AI race depended on removing allegedly liberal biases, proclaiming that "once and for all, we are getting rid of woke."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models, and neither do other countries," Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ed Markey (D.-Mass.) accused Republicans of basing their policies on feelings, not facts, joining critics who suggest that AI isn't "woke" just because of a few "anecdotal" outputs that reflect a liberal bias. And he suggested it was hypocritical that Trump's order "ignores even more egregious evidence" that contradicts claims that AI is trained to be woke, such as xAI's Elon Musk explicitly confirming that Grok was trained to be more right-wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On May 1, 2025, Grok—the AI chatbot developed by xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company—acknowledged that ‘xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right,’" Markey wrote in his letters to tech giants. "If OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini had responded that it was trained to appeal to the left, congressional Republicans would have been outraged and opened an investigation. Instead, they were silent.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;He warned the heads of Alphabet, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI that Trump's AI agenda was allegedly "an authoritarian power grab" intended to "eliminate dissent" and was both "dangerous" and "patently unconstitutional."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if companies' AI models are clearly biased, Markey argued that "Republicans are using state power to pressure private companies to adopt certain political viewpoints," which he claimed is a clear violation of the First Amendment. If AI makers cave, Markey warned, they'd be allowing Trump to create "significant financial incentives" to ensure that "their AI chatbots do not produce speech that would upset the Trump administration."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This type of interference with private speech is precisely why the US Constitution has a First Amendment," Markey wrote, while claiming that Trump's order is factually baseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's "based on the erroneous belief that today’s AI chatbots are 'woke' and biased against Trump," Markey said, urging companies "to fight this unconstitutional executive order and not become a pawn in Trump’s effort to eliminate dissent in this country."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One big reason AI companies may fight order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts agreed with Markey that Trump's order was likely unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, The New York Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Trump may struggle to convince courts that the government isn't impermissibly interfering with AI companies' protected speech or that such interference may be necessary to ensure federal procurement of unbiased AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Lakier, a law professor at the University of Chicago, told the NYT that the lack of clarity around what makes a model biased could be a problem. Courts could deem the order an act of "unconstitutional jawboning," with the Trump administration and Republicans generally perceived as using legal threats to pressure private companies into producing outputs that they like.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Lakier suggested that AI companies may be so motivated to win government contracts or intimidated by possible retaliations from Trump that they may not even challenge the order, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markey is&amp;nbsp;hoping that AI companies will refuse to comply with the order, however, despite recognizing that it places companies "in a difficult position: Either stand on your principles and face the wrath of the Trump administration or cave to Trump and modify your company’s political speech."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one big possible reason that AI companies may have to resist, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oren Etzioni, former CEO of an AI research nonprofit called the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, told CNN that Trump's anti-woke AI order may contradict the top priority of his AI Action Plan—speeding up AI innovation in the US—and actually threaten to hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AI developers struggle to produce what the Trump administration considers "neutral" outputs—a technical challenge that experts agree is not straightforward—that could delay model advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This type of thing… creates all kinds of concerns and liability and complexity for the people developing these models—all of a sudden, they have to slow down," Etzioni told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senator: Grok scandal spotlights GOP hypocrisy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts have suggested that rather than chatbots adopting liberal viewpoints, chatbots are instead possibly filtering out conservative misinformation and unintentionally appearing to favor liberal views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Hall, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business—who published a May paper finding that "Americans view responses from certain popular AI models as being slanted to the left"—told CNN that "tech companies may have put extra guardrails in place to prevent their chatbots from producing content that could be deemed offensive."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Markey seemed to agree, writing that Republicans' "selective outrage matches conservatives’ similar refusal to acknowledge that the Big Tech platforms suspend or impose other penalties disproportionately on conservative users because those users are disproportionately likely to share misinformation, rather than due to any political bias by the platforms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what amount of supposed bias detected in outputs could cause a contract bid to be rejected or an ongoing contract to be cancelled, but AI companies will likely be on the hook to pay for any fees in terminating contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complying with Trump's order could pose a struggle for AI makers for several reasons. First, they'll have to determine what's fact and what's ideology, contending with conflicting government standards in how Trump defines DEI. For example, the president's order counts among "pervasive and destructive" DEI ideologies any outputs that align with long-standing federal protections against discrimination on the basis of race or sex. In addition, they must figure out what counts as "suppression or distortion of factual information about" historical topics like critical race theory, systemic racism, or transgenderism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in Trump's order highlighting outputs offensive to conservatives seem inconsequential. He calls out image generators depicting the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings as not white as problematic, as well as models refusing to misgender a person "even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse" or show white people celebrating their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to imagine how these kinds of flawed outputs could impact government processes, as compared to, say, government contracts granted to models that could be hiding covert racism or sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there has been one example of an AI model displaying a right-wing bias earning a government contract with no red flags raised about its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, Grok shocked the world after Musk announced he would be updating the bot to eliminate a supposed liberal bias. The unhinged chatbot began spouting offensive outputs, including antisemitic posts that praised Hitler as well as proclaiming itself "MechaHitler."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those obvious biases did not conflict with the Pentagon's decision to grant xAI a $200 million federal contract. In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson insisted that "the antisemitism episode wasn’t enough to disqualify" xAI, NBC News reported, partly since "several frontier AI models have produced questionable outputs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon's statement suggested that the government expected to deal with such risks while seizing the opportunity of rapidly deploying emerging AI technology into government prototype processes. And perhaps notably, Trump provides a carveout for any agencies using AI models to safeguard national security, which could exclude the Pentagon from experiencing any "anti-woke" delays in accessing frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that won't help other agencies who must figure out how to assess models to meet anti-woke AI requirements over the next few months. And those assessments could cause delays that Trump may wish to avoid in pushing for widespread AI adoption across government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump’s anti-woke AI agenda may be impossible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day that Trump issued his anti-woke AI order, his AI Action Plan promised an AI "renaissance" fueling "intellectual achievements" by "unraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable, making breakthroughs in scientific and mathematical theory, and creating new kinds of digital and physical art."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, the US must "innovate faster and more comprehensively than our competitors" and eliminate regulatory barriers impeding innovation in order to "set the gold standard for AI worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, achieving the anti-woke ambitions of both orders raises a technical problem that even the president must accept currently has no solution. In his AI Action Plan, Trump acknowledged that "the inner workings of frontier AI systems are poorly understood," with even "advanced technologists" unable to explain "why a model produced a specific output."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether requiring AI companies to explain their AI outputs to win government contracts will mess with other parts of Trump's action plan remains to be seen. But Samir Jain, vice president of policy at a civil liberties group called the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the NYT that he predicts the anti-woke AI agenda will set "a really vague standard that’s going to be impossible for providers to meet."&lt;/p&gt;
