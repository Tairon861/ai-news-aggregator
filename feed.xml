&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Accel and Together Fund joined Salesforce Ventures in the all-equity seed round, which comes only three months after Rocket.new launched its platform in beta in June.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its debut, the startup has crossed 400,000 users — including over 10,000 paid subscribers — in 180 countries and reached $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue. It is aiming to scale that to $20–$25 million by year’s end and $60–$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rocket.new" class="wp-image-3048681" height="1070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg" width="1910" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Rocket.new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5–6% have developed B2B tools, and 4–5% have launched mental health apps, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said. He added that many users build a website on Lovable or Replit, then turn to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The platform combines large language models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems, which are trained on proprietary datasets from DhiWise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our underlying architecture is completely different from what Lovable, Bolt, and everyone is doing,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generating the first application takes about 25 minutes — much slower than most vibe-coding tools, which usually produce results within three. But in our early testing, Rocket.new delivered a more comprehensive user experience, with all essential modules included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rocket.new offers a free trial capped at one million tokens. After that, users pay a monthly subscription starting at $25 for five million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This model effectively discourages hobbyists, while giving Rocket.new a healthy gross margin of 50–55% — a figure it aims to raise to 60–70% within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. is Rocket.new’s largest market, contributing 26% of revenue, followed by Europe at 15–20% and India at 10%. To better serve its American users, the startup is establishing a U.S. headquarters in Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Virani noted that Rocket.new’s early traction was organic, driven by word-of-mouth and viral social posts. With fresh seed funding, the startup is looking to sharpen its go-to-market playbook, deepen its presence in key markets, and accelerate work on proprietary models and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We saw a clear gap between the magic of AI code generation and the reality of making that code production-ready,” Kartik Gupta, Investor at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch over email. “Rocket.new is purpose-built to solve this problem of iteration, maintenance, and deployment at enterprise scale.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rocket.new currently has a 58-member team, primarily in Surat, and expects to double its engineering and product staff in India over the next 12 months to support growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Rocket.new, an Indian startup building an AI-powered app development platform, has raised $15 million in a seed round led by Salesforce Ventures to take on viral vibe-coding rivals like Lovable, Cursor, and Bolt by letting users build full, production-ready apps from natural-language prompts rather than just quick prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

The company launched its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go paid plan for the country’s users last month and now is rolling out the same plan in Indonesia for Rp75,000 ($4.50) per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. The plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said on X.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Turley said that since the company launched the ChatGPT Go plan in India, paid subscribers have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This move puts OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which launched its own similarly-priced AI Plus subscription plan in Indonesia earlier this month. Google’s AI Plus plan gives users access to its Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, along with creative tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. The plan also includes enhanced features for Google’s AI research assistant NotebookLM and integrates AI capabilities into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, along with 200GB of cloud storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2205105208.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its budget-friendly ChatGPT subscription plan beyond India.

The findings, confirmed by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, raise questions about how reliable AI tools are at evaluating scientific research and could complicate efforts by countries and industries seeking to invest in AI tools for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI search tools and chatbots are already known to fabricate links and references. But answers based on the material from actual papers can mislead as well if those papers have been retracted.&amp;nbsp; The chatbot is “using a real paper, real material, to tell you something,” says Weikuan Gu, a medical researcher at the University of Tennessee in Memphis and an author of one of the recent studies. But, he says, if people only look at the content of the answer and do not click through to the paper and see that it’s been retracted, that’s really a problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gu and his team asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT, running on the GPT-4o model, questions based on information from 21 retracted papers on medical imaging. The chatbot’s answers referenced retracted papers in five cases but advised caution in only three. While it cited non-retracted papers for other questions, the authors note it may not have recognized the retraction status of the articles. In a study from August, a different group of researchers used ChatGPT-4o mini to evaluate the quality of 217 retracted and low-quality papers from different scientific fields; they found that none of the chatbot’s responses mentioned retractions or other concerns. (No similar studies have been released on GPT-5, which came out this August.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The public uses AI chatbots to ask for medical advice and diagnose health conditions. Students and scientists increasingly use science-focused AI tools to review existing scientific literature and summarize papers. That kind of usage is likely to increase. The US National Science Foundation, for instance, invested $75 million in building AI models for science research this August.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If [a tool is] facing the general public, then using retraction as a kind of quality indicator is very important,” says Yuanxi Fu, an information science researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There’s “kind of an agreement that retracted papers have been struck off the record of science,” she says, “and the people who are outside of science—they should be warned that these are retracted papers.” OpenAI did not provide a response to a request for comment about the paper results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is not limited to ChatGPT. In June,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; tested AI tools specifically advertised for research work, such as Elicit, Ai2 ScholarQA (now part of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence’s Asta tool), Perplexity, and Consensus, using questions based on the 21 retracted papers in Gu’s study. Elicit referenced five of the retracted papers in its answers, while Ai2 ScholarQA referenced 17, Perplexity 11, and Consensus 18—all without noting the retractions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some companies have since made moves to correct the issue. “Until recently, we didn’t have great retraction data in our search engine,” says Christian Salem, cofounder of Consensus. His company has now started using retraction data from a combination of sources, including publishers and data aggregators, independent web crawling, and Retraction Watch, which manually curates and maintains a database of retractions. In a test of the same papers in August, Consensus cited only five retracted papers.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elicit told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that it removes retracted papers flagged by the scholarly research catalogue OpenAlex from its database and is “still working on aggregating sources of retractions.” Ai2 told us that its tool does not automatically detect or remove retracted papers currently. Perplexity said that it “[does] not ever claim to be 100% accurate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, relying on retraction databases may not be enough. Ivan Oransky, the cofounder of Retraction Watch, is careful not to describe it as a comprehensive database, saying that creating one would require more resources than anyone has: “The reason it’s resource intensive is because someone has to do it all by hand if you want it to be accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further complicating the matter is that publishers don’t share a uniform approach to retraction notices. “Where things are retracted, they can be marked as such in very different ways,” says Caitlin Bakker from University of Regina, Canada, an expert in research and discovery tools. “Correction,” “expression of concern,” “erratum,” and “retracted” are among some labels publishers may add to research papers—and these labels can be added for many reasons, including concerns about the content, methodology, and data or the presence of conflicts of interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers distribute their papers on preprint servers, paper repositories, and other websites, causing copies to be scattered around the web. Moreover, the data used to train AI models may not be up to date. If a paper is retracted after the model’s training cutoff date, its responses might not instantaneously reflect what's going on, says Fu. Most academic search engines don’t do a real-time check against retraction data, so you are at the mercy of how accurate their corpus is, says Aaron Tay, a librarian at Singapore Management University.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oransky and other experts advocate making more context available for models to use when creating a response. This could mean publishing information that already exists, like peer reviews commissioned by journals and critiques from the review site PubPeer, alongside the published paper.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many publishers, such as &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, publish retraction notices as separate articles linked to the paper, outside paywalls. Fu says companies need to effectively make use of such information, as well as any news articles in a model’s training data that mention a paper’s retraction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The users and creators of AI tools need to do their due diligence. “We are at the very, very early stages, and essentially you have to be skeptical,” says Tay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ananya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance science and technology journalist based in Bengaluru, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/retracted-papers2a.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some AI chatbots rely on flawed research from retracted scientific papers to answer questions, according to recent studies.

While it cited non-retracted papers for other questions, the authors note it may not have recognized the retraction status of the articles. In a study from August, a different group of researchers used ChatGPT-4o mini to evaluate the quality of 217 retracted and low-quality papers from different scientific fields; they found that none of the chatbot’s responses mentioned retractions or other concerns. (No similar studies have been released on GPT-5, which came out this August.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The public uses AI chatbots to ask for medical advice and diagnose health conditions. Students and scientists increasingly use science-focused AI tools to review existing scientific literature and summarize papers. That kind of usage is likely to increase. The US National Science Foundation, for instance, invested $75 million in building AI models for science research this August.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If [a tool is] facing the general public, then using retraction as a kind of quality indicator is very important,” says Yuanxi Fu, an information science researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There’s “kind of an agreement that retracted papers have been struck off the record of science,” she says, “and the people who are outside of science—they should be warned that these are retracted papers.” OpenAI did not provide a response to a request for comment about the paper results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is not limited to ChatGPT. In June,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; tested AI tools specifically advertised for research work, such as Elicit, Ai2 ScholarQA (now part of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence’s Asta tool), Perplexity, and Consensus, using questions based on the 21 retracted papers in Gu’s study. Elicit referenced five of the retracted papers in its answers, while Ai2 ScholarQA referenced 17, Perplexity 11, and Consensus 18—all without noting the retractions.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some companies have since made moves to correct the issue. “Until recently, we didn’t have great retraction data in our search engine,” says Christian Salem, cofounder of Consensus. His company has now started using retraction data from a combination of sources, including publishers and data aggregators, independent web crawling, and Retraction Watch, which manually curates and maintains a database of retractions. In a test of the same papers in August, Consensus cited only five retracted papers.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elicit told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that it removes retracted papers flagged by the scholarly research catalogue OpenAlex from its database and is “still working on aggregating sources of retractions.” Ai2 told us that its tool does not automatically detect or remove retracted papers currently. Perplexity said that it “[does] not ever claim to be 100% accurate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, relying on retraction databases may not be enough. Ivan Oransky, the cofounder of Retraction Watch, is careful not to describe it as a comprehensive database, saying that creating one would require more resources than anyone has: “The reason it’s resource intensive is because someone has to do it all by hand if you want it to be accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further complicating the matter is that publishers don’t share a uniform approach to retraction notices. “Where things are retracted, they can be marked as such in very different ways,” says Caitlin Bakker from University of Regina, Canada, an expert in research and discovery tools. “Correction,” “expression of concern,” “erratum,” and “retracted” are among some labels publishers may add to research papers—and these labels can be added for many reasons, including concerns about the content, methodology, and data or the presence of conflicts of interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers distribute their papers on preprint servers, paper repositories, and other websites, causing copies to be scattered around the web. Moreover, the data used to train AI models may not be up to date. If a paper is retracted after the model’s training cutoff date, its responses might not instantaneously reflect what's going on, says Fu. Most academic search engines don’t do a real-time check against retraction data, so you are at the mercy of how accurate their corpus is, says Aaron Tay, a librarian at Singapore Management University.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oransky and other experts advocate making more context available for models to use when creating a response. This could mean publishing information that already exists, like peer reviews commissioned by journals and critiques from the review site PubPeer, alongside the published paper.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many publishers, such as &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, publish retraction notices as separate articles linked to the paper, outside paywalls. Fu says companies need to effectively make use of such information, as well as any news articles in a model’s training data that mention a paper’s retraction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The users and creators of AI tools need to do their due diligence. “We are at the very, very early stages, and essentially you have to be skeptical,” says Tay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ananya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance science and technology journalist based in Bengaluru, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/23/1123897/ai-models-are-using-material-from-retracted-scientific-papers/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] At Climate Week NYC, NVIDIA Details AI’s Key Role in the Sustainable Energy Transition (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-energy-innovation-climate-research/</link><description>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency in large language model inference has improved 100,000x in the past 10 years — demonstrating that accelerated computing is sustainable computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Net-Zero America Project’s calculations, if AI applications are fully adopted, nearly 4.5% of projected energy demand in 2035 will be saved across the three most energy-intensive sectors — industry, transportation and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-85225" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Climate-NYC-Graphics-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA joined a Climate Week panel discussion on AI: Powering a More Productive Energy Future yesterday following the release of Center for Strategic and International Studies findings on AI and energy. Panelists included Crusoe Energy Systems, a company that builds and operates clean computing infrastructure, and Emerald AI, a startup developing an AI solution to control data center power use during times of peak grid demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion centered around how AI will advance sustainability solutions at an unprecedented pace–from responsible grid and power infrastructure scaling&amp;nbsp; to reliable transportation and nuclear energy optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Startup Ecosystem Advances AI Energy Efficiency, Sustainability Projects&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI, a NVIDIA NVentures portfolio company, is collaborating with NVIDIA on a recently unveiled NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for building high-performance, grid-friendly and energy-efficient AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new reference design enables the transformation of data centers into fully integrated AI factories — optimized so that every watt of energy contributes to intelligence generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a collaborator on NVIDIA’s reference design for giga-scale AI factories, we’re helping prove that AI compute can be power-flexible,” said Varun Sivaram, founder and CEO of Emerald AI. “It’s a paradigm shift with a massive prize: unlocking 100 gigawatts of untapped power grid capacity and resolving AI’s energy bottleneck while promoting affordable, reliable and clean power grids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, within the Sustainable Futures initiative. These companies are pioneering developments in fields such as green computing, sustainable infrastructure, wildlife conservation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decreasing the Carbon Footprint of NVIDIA Products and Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is continuously working to decrease its own carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its first product carbon footprint summary comparison was recently released — revealing a 24% reduction in embodied carbon emissions intensity between NVIDIA HGX H100 and HGX B200 baseboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85210"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-85210" height="1094" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HGX-B200-Product-Carbon-Footprint-Methodology.png" width="1569" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85210"&gt;Scope and methodology of the product carbon footprint analysis for NVIDIA HGX B200.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA will continue to publish product carbon footprint summaries of newly released products to spotlight improvements in energy efficiency and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of NVIDIA’s physical footprint, all offices and data centers under the company’s operational control run on 100% renewable energy — and carbon-free electricity is purchased to cover 100% of the company’s leased data centers’ footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85207"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-85207" height="976" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NVIDIA-aerial-Voyager-and-Endeavor-1680x976.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85207"&gt;NVIDIA headquarters in Santa Clara, California&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applying AI to Climate and Weather Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution, AI-powered weather models are helping strengthen energy systems and reduce vulnerability to unpredictable climate events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used to support energy grid stability, these simulations can help utilities more precisely direct maintenance crews to remove obstacles close to power lines ahead of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI-driven climate models are also poised to increase the adoption and usage of renewables across the energy grid by lowering costs and ramping up efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these climate models, grid operators can accurately determine factors like the amount of power wind turbines will generate on a given day, or how much energy collected in solar batteries will need to be saved to compensate and keep a city’s lights on and stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These insights can help energy providers manage load and lower the cost of adopting renewables, presenting a path forward to decarbonize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Earth-2 platform offers tools, microservices, and reference implementations that help developers build applications to simulate and visualize weather and climate predictions at a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work powered by Earth-2 is featured on an array of panels at Climate Week, including Columbia University’s GenAI for Climate Science, AI for Energy and Energy for AI, Where the Internet Lives, Presented by Google, and the AWS Climate Tech &amp;amp; AI Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Net-Zero America Project’s calculations, if AI applications are fully adopted, nearly 4.5% of projected energy demand in 2035 will be saved across the three most energy-intensive sectors — industry, transportation and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA joined a Climate Week panel discussion on AI: Powering a More Productive Energy Future yesterday following the release of Center for Strategic and International Studies findings on AI and energy. Panelists included Crusoe Energy Systems, a company that builds and operates clean computing infrastructure, and Emerald AI, a startup developing an AI solution to control data center power use during times of peak grid demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion centered around how AI will advance sustainability solutions at an unprecedented pace–from responsible grid and power infrastructure scaling&amp;nbsp; to reliable transportation and nuclear energy optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Startup Ecosystem Advances AI Energy Efficiency, Sustainability Projects&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI, a NVIDIA NVentures portfolio company, is collaborating with NVIDIA on a recently unveiled NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for building high-performance, grid-friendly and energy-efficient AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new reference design enables the transformation of data centers into fully integrated AI factories — optimized so that every watt of energy contributes to intelligence generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a collaborator on NVIDIA’s reference design for giga-scale AI factories, we’re helping prove that AI compute can be power-flexible,” said Varun Sivaram, founder and CEO of Emerald AI. “It’s a paradigm shift with a massive prize: unlocking 100 gigawatts of untapped power grid capacity and resolving AI’s energy bottleneck while promoting affordable, reliable and clean power grids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, within the Sustainable Futures initiative. These companies are pioneering developments in fields such as green computing, sustainable infrastructure, wildlife conservation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decreasing the Carbon Footprint of NVIDIA Products and Operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is continuously working to decrease its own carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its first product carbon footprint summary comparison was recently released — revealing a 24% reduction in embodied carbon emissions intensity between NVIDIA HGX H100 and HGX B200 baseboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85210"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-85210" height="1094" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HGX-B200-Product-Carbon-Footprint-Methodology.png" width="1569" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85210"&gt;Scope and methodology of the product carbon footprint analysis for NVIDIA HGX B200.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA will continue to publish product carbon footprint summaries of newly released products to spotlight improvements in energy efficiency and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of NVIDIA’s physical footprint, all offices and data centers under the company’s operational control run on 100% renewable energy — and carbon-free electricity is purchased to cover 100% of the company’s leased data centers’ footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85207"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-85207" height="976" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NVIDIA-aerial-Voyager-and-Endeavor-1680x976.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85207"&gt;NVIDIA headquarters in Santa Clara, California&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applying AI to Climate and Weather Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution, AI-powered weather models are helping strengthen energy systems and reduce vulnerability to unpredictable climate events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used to support energy grid stability, these simulations can help utilities more precisely direct maintenance crews to remove obstacles close to power lines ahead of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI-driven climate models are also poised to increase the adoption and usage of renewables across the energy grid by lowering costs and ramping up efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these climate models, grid operators can accurately determine factors like the amount of power wind turbines will generate on a given day, or how much energy collected in solar batteries will need to be saved to compensate and keep a city’s lights on and stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These insights can help energy providers manage load and lower the cost of adopting renewables, presenting a path forward to decarbonize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVIDIA Earth-2 platform offers tools, microservices, and reference implementations that help developers build applications to simulate and visualize weather and climate predictions at a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work powered by Earth-2 is featured on an array of panels at Climate Week, including Columbia University’s GenAI for Climate Science, AI for Energy and Energy for AI, Where the Internet Lives, Presented by Google, and the AWS Climate Tech &amp;amp; AI Forum.&lt;/p&gt;
