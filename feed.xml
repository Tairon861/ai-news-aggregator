The company said that this tool is still in the experimental stage and users will need to opt in to it through Search Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once a user has opted in, they can ask queries in English. Google didn’t specify whether it plans to support local languages or when that might be available.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can search for answers to complex, multi-part queries such as “My kids are 4 and 7 and have lots of energy. Suggest creative ways to get them active and moving indoors, especially on hot days, without needing a lot of space or expensive toys.” Additionally, users can ask follow-up questions to refine results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google started testing AI mode with premium subscribers in the U.S. earlier this year. The company then started broadly rolling out the feature to all U.S. users after its Google IO event. Over time, the company has added a shopping feature, introduced voice and image search support, and also introduced ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that voice and image search features are supported for users in India, given that voice is a popular mode for search. It added that the AI mode is powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5. The company also noted that early testers of the AI mode are asking 2-3x longer queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With more than 870 million internet users, India is one of the biggest markets for Google. It also acts as a testing ground for the company to observe how multilingual users use its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Google still has a lion’s share in the search market, people have started using chat-based AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity more in their daily lives. With AI mode, Google wants users who prefer that kind of interface to use its own product. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apart from AI mode, Google has been pushing products such as AI overviews, which summarize query results for you, in search. The company said in April that more than 1.5 billion people are using AI overviews across the globe. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google’s AI features are hurting publishers, which have seen traffic drop-offs from organic search.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google introduced its AI mode, a Q&amp;amp;A-style search tool, to users in India today.

The industrial focus suggests Huawei is using AI development to strengthen its enterprise relationships while consumer market access remains constrained by geopolitical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI model’s integration with HarmonyOS 6 creates a vertically integrated stack where Huawei controls both the AI infrastructure and the operating system deployment, potentially offering advantages in optimisation and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Market trajectory and strategic implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to consultancy Canalys, Huawei has shipped more than 103 million smartphones and 21 million tablets running HarmonyOS, with nearly half delivered in 2024. The acceleration indicates growing internal adoption and suggests the platform is gaining momentum in China’s domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has expanded HarmonyOS beyond mobile devices, launching two laptops with the operating system last month. The multi-device strategy aims to create a unified software experience similar to Apple’s ecosystem approach, though execution in diverse hardware categories presents significant technical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HarmonyOS 6 development reflects Huawei’s broader transformation from a hardware-focused company to a software and services provider.

(Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1119187/fix-ai-evaluation-crisis/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250623_algo_v2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a tech reporter I often get asked questions like “Is DeepSeek actually better than ChatGPT?” or “Is the Anthropic model any good?” If I don’t feel like turning it into an hour-long seminar, I’ll usually give the diplomatic answer: “They’re both solid in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most people asking aren’t defining “good” in any precise way, and that’s fair. It’s human to want to make sense of something new and seemingly powerful. &lt;strong&gt;But that simple question—Is this model good?—is really just the everyday version of a much more complicated technical problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the way we’ve tried to answer that question is through benchmarks. These give models a fixed set of questions to answer and grade them on how many they get right. But just like exams like the SAT (an admissions test used by many US colleges), these benchmarks don’t always reflect deeper abilities. Lately it feels as if a new AI model drops every week, and every time a company launches one, it comes with fresh scores showing it beating the capabilities of predecessors. &lt;strong&gt;On paper, everything appears to be getting better all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In practice, it’s not so simple. &lt;/strong&gt;Just as grinding for the SAT might boost your score without improving your critical thinking, models can be trained to optimize for benchmark results without actually getting smarter, as Russell Brandon explained in his piece for us. As OpenAI and Tesla AI veteran Andrej Karpathy recently put it, we’re living through an evaluation crisis—our scoreboard for AI no longer reflects what we really want to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks have grown stale for a few key reasons. First, the industry has learned to “teach to the test,” training AI models to score well rather than genuinely improve. Second, widespread data contamination means models may have already seen the benchmark questions, or even the answers, somewhere in their training data. And finally, many benchmarks are simply maxed out. On popular tests like SuperGLUE, models have already reached or surpassed 90% accuracy, making further gains feel more like statistical noise than meaningful improvement. &lt;strong&gt;At that point, the scores stop telling us anything useful. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s especially true in high-skill domains like coding, reasoning, and complex STEM problem-solving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there are a growing number of teams around the world trying to address the AI evaluation crisis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One result is a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro. It draws problems from international algorithmic olympiads—competitions for elite high school and university programmers where participants solve challenging problems without external tools. The top AI models currently manage only about 53% at first pass on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on the hardest ones. These are tasks where human experts routinely excel.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Zihan Zheng, a junior at NYU and a world finalist in competitive coding, led the project to develop LiveCodeBench Pro with a team of olympiad medalists. They’ve published both the benchmark and a detailed study showing that top-tier models like GPT-4o mini and Google’s Gemini 2.5 perform at a level comparable to the top 10% of human competitors. Across the board, Zheng observed a pattern: AI excels at making plans and executing tasks, but it struggles with nuanced algorithmic reasoning. “It shows that AI is still far from matching the best human coders,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LiveCodeBench Pro might define a new upper bar. But what about the floor?&lt;/strong&gt; Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their riskiness, not just how well they perform. In real-world, application-driven environments—especially with AI agents—unreliability, hallucinations, and brittleness are ruinous. One wrong move could spell disaster when money or safety are on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other new attempts to address the problem. Some benchmarks, like ARC-AGI, now keep part of their data set private to prevent AI models from being optimized excessively for the test, a problem called “overfitting.” Meta’s Yann LeCun has created LiveBench, a dynamic benchmark where questions evolve every six months. The goal is to evaluate models not just on knowledge but on adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbench, a Chinese benchmark project developed by HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China), is another one of these effort.&amp;nbsp;I just wrote about it in a story. &lt;/strong&gt;Xbench was initially built in 2022—right after ChatGPT’s launch—as an internal tool to evaluate models for investment research. Over time, the team expanded the system and brought in external collaborators. It just made parts of its question set publicly available last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Xbench is notable for its dual-track design, which tries to bridge the gap between lab-based tests and real-world utility. The first track evaluates technical reasoning skills by testing a model’s STEM knowledge and ability to carry out Chinese-language research. The second track aims to assess practical usefulness—how well a model performs on tasks in fields like recruitment and marketing. For instance, one task asks an agent to identify five qualified battery engineer candidates; another has it match brands with relevant influencers from a pool of more than 800 creators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind Xbench has big ambitions. They plan to expand its testing capabilities into sectors like finance, law, and design, and they plan to update the test set quarterly to avoid stagnation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is something that I often wonder about, because a model’s hardcore reasoning ability doesn’t necessarily translate into a fun, informative, and creative experience. Most queries from average users are probably not going to be rocket science. There isn’t much research yet on how to effectively evaluate a model’s creativity, but I’d love to know which model would be the best for creative writing or art projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Human preference testing has also emerged as an alternative to benchmarks. One increasingly popular platform is LMarena, which lets users submit questions and compare responses from different models side by side—and then pick which one they like best. Still, this method has its flaws. Users sometimes reward the answer that sounds more flattering or agreeable, even if it’s wrong. That can incentivize “sweet-talking” models and skew results in favor of pandering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI researchers are beginning to realize—and admit—that the status quo of AI testing cannot continue.&lt;/strong&gt; At the recent CVPR conference, NYU professor Saining Xie drew on historian James Carse’s Finite and Infinite Games to critique the hypercompetitive culture of AI research. An infinite game, he noted, is open-ended—the goal is to keep playing. But in AI, a dominant player often drops a big result, triggering a wave of follow-up papers chasing the same narrow topic. This race-to-publish culture puts enormous pressure on researchers and rewards speed over depth, short-term wins over long-term insight. “If academia chooses to play a finite game,” he warned, “it will lose everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found his framing powerful—and maybe it applies to benchmarks, too. So, do we have a truly comprehensive scoreboard for how good a model is? Not really. Many dimensions—social, emotional, interdisciplinary—still evade assessment. But the wave of new benchmarks hints at a shift. As the field evolves, a bit of skepticism is probably healthy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The Algorithm&lt;em&gt;, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Lately it feels as if a new AI model drops every week, and every time a company launches one, it comes with fresh scores showing it beating the capabilities of predecessors. &lt;strong&gt;On paper, everything appears to be getting better all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In practice, it’s not so simple. &lt;/strong&gt;Just as grinding for the SAT might boost your score without improving your critical thinking, models can be trained to optimize for benchmark results without actually getting smarter, as Russell Brandon explained in his piece for us. As OpenAI and Tesla AI veteran Andrej Karpathy recently put it, we’re living through an evaluation crisis—our scoreboard for AI no longer reflects what we really want to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks have grown stale for a few key reasons. First, the industry has learned to “teach to the test,” training AI models to score well rather than genuinely improve. Second, widespread data contamination means models may have already seen the benchmark questions, or even the answers, somewhere in their training data. And finally, many benchmarks are simply maxed out. On popular tests like SuperGLUE, models have already reached or surpassed 90% accuracy, making further gains feel more like statistical noise than meaningful improvement. &lt;strong&gt;At that point, the scores stop telling us anything useful. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s especially true in high-skill domains like coding, reasoning, and complex STEM problem-solving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there are a growing number of teams around the world trying to address the AI evaluation crisis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One result is a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro. It draws problems from international algorithmic olympiads—competitions for elite high school and university programmers where participants solve challenging problems without external tools. The top AI models currently manage only about 53% at first pass on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on the hardest ones. These are tasks where human experts routinely excel.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Zihan Zheng, a junior at NYU and a world finalist in competitive coding, led the project to develop LiveCodeBench Pro with a team of olympiad medalists. They’ve published both the benchmark and a detailed study showing that top-tier models like GPT-4o mini and Google’s Gemini 2.5 perform at a level comparable to the top 10% of human competitors. Across the board, Zheng observed a pattern: AI excels at making plans and executing tasks, but it struggles with nuanced algorithmic reasoning. “It shows that AI is still far from matching the best human coders,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LiveCodeBench Pro might define a new upper bar. But what about the floor?&lt;/strong&gt; Earlier this month, a group of researchers from multiple universities argued that LLM agents should be evaluated primarily on the basis of their riskiness, not just how well they perform. In real-world, application-driven environments—especially with AI agents—unreliability, hallucinations, and brittleness are ruinous. One wrong move could spell disaster when money or safety are on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other new attempts to address the problem. Some benchmarks, like ARC-AGI, now keep part of their data set private to prevent AI models from being optimized excessively for the test, a problem called “overfitting.” Meta’s Yann LeCun has created LiveBench, a dynamic benchmark where questions evolve every six months. The goal is to evaluate models not just on knowledge but on adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbench, a Chinese benchmark project developed by HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China), is another one of these effort.&amp;nbsp;I just wrote about it in a story. &lt;/strong&gt;Xbench was initially built in 2022—right after ChatGPT’s launch—as an internal tool to evaluate models for investment research. Over time, the team expanded the system and brought in external collaborators. It just made parts of its question set publicly available last week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Xbench is notable for its dual-track design, which tries to bridge the gap between lab-based tests and real-world utility. The first track evaluates technical reasoning skills by testing a model’s STEM knowledge and ability to carry out Chinese-language research. The second track aims to assess practical usefulness—how well a model performs on tasks in fields like recruitment and marketing. For instance, one task asks an agent to identify five qualified battery engineer candidates; another has it match brands with relevant influencers from a pool of more than 800 creators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind Xbench has big ambitions. They plan to expand its testing capabilities into sectors like finance, law, and design, and they plan to update the test set quarterly to avoid stagnation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is something that I often wonder about, because a model’s hardcore reasoning ability doesn’t necessarily translate into a fun, informative, and creative experience. Most queries from average users are probably not going to be rocket science. There isn’t much research yet on how to effectively evaluate a model’s creativity, but I’d love to know which model would be the best for creative writing or art projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Human preference testing has also emerged as an alternative to benchmarks. One increasingly popular platform is LMarena, which lets users submit questions and compare responses from different models side by side—and then pick which one they like best. Still, this method has its flaws. Users sometimes reward the answer that sounds more flattering or agreeable, even if it’s wrong. That can incentivize “sweet-talking” models and skew results in favor of pandering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI researchers are beginning to realize—and admit—that the status quo of AI testing cannot continue.&lt;/strong&gt; At the recent CVPR conference, NYU professor Saining Xie drew on historian James Carse’s Finite and Infinite Games to critique the hypercompetitive culture of AI research. An infinite game, he noted, is open-ended—the goal is to keep playing. But in AI, a dominant player often drops a big result, triggering a wave of follow-up papers chasing the same narrow topic. This race-to-publish culture puts enormous pressure on researchers and rewards speed over depth, short-term wins over long-term insight. “If academia chooses to play a finite game,” he warned, “it will lose everything.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found his framing powerful—and maybe it applies to benchmarks, too. So, do we have a truly comprehensive scoreboard for how good a model is? Not really. Many dimensions—social, emotional, interdisciplinary—still evade assessment. But the wave of new benchmarks hints at a shift. As the field evolves, a bit of skepticism is probably healthy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The Algorithm&lt;em&gt;, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Inside a building to Michels’s left sits a 12-megawatt electrolyzer—a machine resembling two giant AA batteries that is designed to split water into its two component parts, H₂ and O. Behind him is the desert factory’s key piece of proprietary tech: a rotating kiln in which the hydrogen gas from that water is mixed with iron ore to create a pure form of iron, the main ingredient in steel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Factories have used fossil fuels to process iron ore for three centuries, and the climate has paid a heavy price: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the steel industry today accounts for 8% of carbon dioxide emissions. Purifying the ore involves extracting iron that is bound to oxygen, and “removing the bond between the iron and oxygen requires a massive amount of energy,” says Michels, the 39-year-old CEO of HyIron, the startup behind the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it turns out there is a less carbon-­intensive alternative: using hydrogen to extract the iron. Unlike coal or natural gas, which release carbon dioxide as a by-product, this process, Michels explains, releases water. And if the hydrogen itself is “green”—meaning it’s made through renewable-­powered electrolysis rather than the conventional technique of mixing natural gas and steam—the climate impact of the entire process will be minimal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;HyIron, which began processing test batches of iron a month after my visit, is one of a handful of companies around the world that are betting green hydrogen can help the $1.8 trillion steel industry clean up its act. What sets it apart, above all, is its location. HyIron’s kiln was designed and prototyped in Germany, but the production site is in Namibia, more than 5,000 miles to the south. This former German colony, which was ruled by South Africa from 1915 to 1990, has little industry itself and is an ocean or two away from the world’s biggest importers of iron. What it does have is immense untapped potential for wind and solar power, which studies suggest could make it possible to produce hydrogen and its derivative products, like iron, ammonia, and low-carbon aviation fuel, as cheaply as is feasible anywhere. HyIron’s site in the Namib Desert, 50 miles from the Atlantic coast, averages just 30 hours of overcast skies per year, Michels tells me. The energy potential here, he says, is “incredible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michels, who trained as an economist and started HyIron as a side project when his family-owned safari lodge went quiet during the covid pandemic, isn’t the only Namibian with big plans for hydrogen. Since 2021, when the government identified the gas as a potentially “transformative strategic industry,” it’s become something of a national obsession. There are at least nine other projects planned or under construction, including one, in Namibia’s south, that’s among the largest proposed green hydrogen investments in the world. The Namibian government’s Green Hydrogen and Derivatives Strategy, released in 2022, envisions the creation of three “hydrogen valleys,” along the southern, central, and northern coasts, with a target production of 10 million to 12 million metric tons per year by 2050. That’s equivalent to more than 10% of all hydrogen made annually today. As soon as 2030, the strategy document claims, the industry could create 80,000 jobs and raise GDP by 30% through a combination of tax revenue, royalties, and the knock-on effect of so many investments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If even a fraction of this production comes to pass, it will give Namibia’s economy a major boost. But it is a gamble. Green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy, and long-term demand for its products remains uncertain. Pursuing a technology that isn’t yet commercially established, some critics fear, could strain government resources and distract from more urgent priorities, including the persistence of hunger and a domestic power grid that reaches only half of Namibia’s households. This is especially the case with the largest project under development, along the country’s southern coast, which will require at least $10 billion to get off the ground, a figure nearly as big as Namibia’s GDP today. That venture is contentious for environmental reasons, too: Under current plans, most of its infrastructure will be built inside a national park in a location Namibia’s top environmental watchdog calls the “most sensitive ecosystem in southern Africa.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Given the small country that we are, we’re risking quite a lot entering into this global race,” says Ronny Dempers, executive director of the Namibia Development Trust, which advocates for community-based management of natural resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding to the uncertainty is the death last year of Namibian president Hage Geingob, the hydrogen strategy’s chief political backer. The new president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who took office in March, hails from the same political party, but multiple people familiar with her thinking told me she’s keener on developing oil and natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, HyIron’s launch has given Namibia’s hydrogen ambitions a long-awaited jolt of momentum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question now is whether Namibia’s government, its trading partners, and hydrogen innovators like Michels can work together to build the industry in a way that satisfies the world’s appetite for cleaner fuels—and also helps improve lives at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lightest element&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of powering the world with hydrogen is hardly new. In his 1874 novel &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Island&lt;/em&gt;, Jules Verne wrote that water, “decomposed” into hydrogen and oxygen, could function as the “coal of the future.” Not only is hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe, but H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, when burned, does not produce greenhouse gases and releases more energy per unit mass than any other nonradioactive fuel—roughly five times more than coal and three times more than gasoline or diesel. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen, pure hydrogen gas can’t readily be captured from the atmosphere—because it’s so light, it tends to escape into space. Instead, hydrogen must be sourced by splitting it off from other molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, the process has been anything but green: Most hydrogen made today, primarily for use in petroleum refining, fertilizers, and petrochemicals, is created through a process called steam methane reforming, in which high-temperature steam reacts with methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), releasing large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process. As a result, the IEA calls hydrogen today “more of a climate problem than a climate solution.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making hydrogen via electrolysis, as Verne described, was first achieved around 1800. But the process needs a lot of energy, and it wasn’t until the late 2010s, with the costs of wind and solar power falling and governments taking concrete steps to help keep global warming to a minimum, that commercial interest in splitting water with renewables began to emerge. A road map published by the IEA in 2023, which outlines a path to reaching net-zero ­emissions by midcentury, calls for dramatically expanded use of this “green” hydrogen. A portion of it would replace conventional “gray” hydrogen for existing uses. But the bulk would be for new applications, like iron and steel production, power generation, or long-haul transport—some fueled by hydrogen itself and others by derivatives like ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is made by fusing hydrogen with nitrogen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most rich countries have adopted policies that incentivize this shift. The European Union, for example, which has caps on fossil-fuel emissions in many sectors, mandates that 42% of hydrogen used by 2030 originate from renewable sources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118682" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Oshivela-Launch-45.jpg?w=1053" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, president of Namibia, speaks at a ceremonial opening for HyIron Oshivela in April.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118679" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-2.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Part of the facility’s 12-megawatt electrolyzer, which separates hydrogen from water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118680" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-3.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After hydrogen gas is created in the electrolyzer, it is sent into liquid-gas separators, which remove residual water.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118681" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Oshivela-Launch-30.jpg?w=754" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Johannes Michels, CEO of HyIron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many African countries, this represents an opportunity. According to the IEA, the continent is home to 60% of the world’s best potential sites for solar power, thanks to its levels of year-round sunshine and quantity of land suitable for solar farms. The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance, a 10-country body formed in 2022, believes Africa can produce nearly a quarter of the hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives traded globally by 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A handful of North African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, have tentative plans to send hydrogen to Europe via pipelines—some new, and some retrofitted from existing pipelines built to carry natural gas. Namibia’s distance from Europe makes pipeline transport economically prohibitive. Shipping H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, which takes up a lot of space even when stored in high-pressure tanks, wouldn’t be cost-competitive either. So Namibia’s plan is to use the hydrogen it makes to create iron, ammonia, and other products, which are dense enough to be transported by sea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The country’s biggest advantage is its especially strong wind and solar potential. Marco Raffinetti, CEO of Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, the firm developing the large-scale project in the south, believes that the company’s site there is one of the top three spots for hydrogen production in the world. The key, he says, is strong winds that peak at times when solar output is low, which minimizes power fluctuations and thus reduces costs. Namibia has other selling points as well, including vast tracts of sparsely populated land, a stable political climate, and a government open to new economic opportunities. The country’s GDP per capita, $4,168, ranks among the top 10 in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Namibia is also the world’s second most economically unequal society, in large part because of more than 40 years of rule under South African apartheid that included forced relocation. De facto segregation is still visible. Upmarket neighborhoods of the capital, Windhoek, home to a large share of the country’s white minority, resemble parts of suburban Los Angeles, with modernist houses on quiet tree-lined streets stretching into the surrounding hills. But much of the city’s population resides in an apartheid-era settlement known as Katutura, or “the place where we do not want to live.” Many of the homes here are corrugated-iron shacks without electricity or running water.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Namibia’s poverty is also a consequence of more recent economic stagnation. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita fell by 30% between 2012 and 2023. Uranium, one of the country’s largest exports, faced a decade-long slump as several countries reevaluated their use of nuclear power following the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima, Japan. Namibia’s fishing sector was hit with a major corruption scandal in 2019 that left two high-ranking officials in prison. Then came covid, which stifled tourism, and the country’s worst drought in a century, which left nearly half the population in need of aid; according to government figures, more than 1,100 people died of malnutrition between 2020 and 2024. Jobs are now scarcer than ever. As of 2023, according to the Namibia Statistics Agency, fewer than one in three people of working age were employed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It is in this context that Geingob, the late president, turned to hydrogen. A veteran of the independence struggle, Geingob had been elected in 2014 by promising to deliver prosperity. Instead, according to Robin Sherbourne, an economist who’s studied Namibia since the 1990s, growth continued to stagnate and support for his party began to wane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Green hydrogen was starting to take off, and Namibia had all the basic ingredients,” Sherbourne tells me. “So [Geingob] jumped at it. It gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‘Look, things are happening.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‘Look, things are happening.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Robin Sherbourne, economist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Electrolyzers in the desert&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two and a half years after the release of the government’s Green Hydrogen Strategy, the industry is gradually coming to life. HyIron’s current setup, which cost €30 million (currently $34 million) and was financed in part by a grant from the German government, is capable of producing 15,000 metric tons of iron per year, roughly enough for 10,000 midsize cars or one large high-rise ­building. Michels hopes to scale that to 2 million metric tons by 2030, at an estimated cost of $2.7 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another project, developed by the Belgian shipping company CMB.Tech and the Namibian firm Ohlthaver &amp;amp; List, is working to produce trial amounts of hydrogen. In a second phase, it will trial generation of ammonia, which is primarily used today in fertilizers but could eventually be a key fuel for ocean-faring vessels. Ultimately the idea is to spend $3 billion on commercial-­scale ammonia production, aiming for 250,000 metric tons per year by the end of the decade, as well as a terminal at the port of Walvis Bay, where vessels rounding the southern tip of Africa will be able to bunker with the fuel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="aerial view of a solar array and facility" class="wp-image-1118676" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cleanergy_overview.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Near the port city of Walvis Bay, the Belgian shipping company CMB.Tech, in partnership with the Namibian firm Ohlthaver &amp;amp; List, has built a solar-powered plant to create hydrogen that can be dispensed as fuel. In the future, the venture will use hydrogen to produce ammonia, some of which will fuel CMB.Tech’s own oceanfaring vessels. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF CMB.TECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hyphen project, by contrast, exists for now mainly on paper. Although the company signed a concession agreement with Namibia’s government in 2023, it hasn’t yet secured the financing it needs to move ahead with construction. But if the project does come to life, it will be one of the world’s largest: Plans call for the installation of seven gigawatts of renewable power, more than 10 times Namibia’s current generation capacity, to produce 2 million metric tons of ammonia annually by 2030. According to Raffinetti, Hyphen plans to “overbuild” the accompanying infrastructure so it could also be used in future projects in the planned southern hydrogen valley. Meeting Namibia’s 2050 targets under the Green Hydrogen Strategy would require the equivalent&amp;nbsp;of 30 Hyphen-size projects spread across the three corridors of production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This planned footprint has already been the source of controversy. Hyphen’s concession—the land it has been granted access to—encompasses 18% of Tsau Khaeb National Park, a protected area about the size of Massachusetts that’s home to flamingos, African penguins, and 31 species of plants found nowhere else on Earth, many of them water-storing succulents that blanket the desert in majestic pastel-colored flowers when it rains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118675" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cleanergy_HydrogenAcademy.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CMB.Tech project’s Hydrogen Academy has begun holding training sessions on hydrogen and how to handle it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF CMB.TECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris Brown, who leads the Namibia Chamber of Environment, a coalition of environmental NGOs, says the project would irreparably damage the “integrity and resilience” of the park. Raffinetti says Hyphen’s equipment will take up a small fraction of its concession and will be built in a “surgical way” to avoid the most ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But environmentalists are not the only ones who’ve criticized the choice of location. An expanded port, built to facilitate ammonia exports, will sit immediately adjacent to a site that housed a labor and extermination camp during Namibia’s 1904–1908 genocide, in which tens of thousands of Nama and Herero people were killed by German soldiers during a period of resistance to colonial rule. A 2024 report commissioned by Nama and Herero leaders argues that the extension of port infrastructure would “desecrate” the heritage of the area and those who died there. It doesn’t help the optics that Hyphen’s majority shareholder, the renewable power producer Enertrag, is a German company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these sensitivities, Namibia’s broader hydrogen aspirations remain subject to many questions. While the country’s desert climate is ideal for generating power, the other key input for green hydrogen—water—is scarce. The central coastal region, where the HyIron and CMB.Tech projects (as well as several others in early-stage development) are based, already sources much of its water from a local seawater desalination plant that’s powered only in part by renewables. Other facilities are planned here and in the south, but some worry that hydrogen projects could face water-related bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here, we want our household problems to be solved.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;William Minnie, youth spokesperson, the Landless People’s Movement&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Namibia’s prospects also hinge on a global market for green fuels that’s highly precarious. Over the past few years, the hydrogen sector has gone from a period of “hype” to one of “disillusionment,” according to Martin Tengler, head of hydrogen research at BloombergNEF, which studies markets for new energy technologies. Absent incentives, Tengler is skeptical that green hydrogen will ever reach cost parity with gray hydrogen in most parts of the world. Certain industries, though, could embrace it even if it costs more. He notes that some higher-end automakers have already shown a willingness to pay a premium for green steel, even if it means a car’s price goes up by 2 or 3%. (Benteler, a German metals processing firm that supplies the automotive market, has committed to purchasing test quantities of green iron from HyIron.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Uncertainties also surround the future of ammonia. According to the IEA road map, ammonia made from green hydrogen could power 44% of global shipping by midcentury. But it, too, is likely to remain expensive relative to both conventional fuels and carbon-based alternatives like methanol and liquefied natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some in Namibia are especially worried about Hyphen, which has not yet signed any binding agreements with customers. In a bid to boost Hyphen’s attractiveness to other financiers, the government assumed a 24% ownership stake in the venture. The money it’s put in so far, roughly €24 million ($27&amp;nbsp;million), is covered by a Dutch government grant. But Namibia’s portion of construction would likely be financed through loans, exposing taxpayers to the project’s risks. Detlof von Oertzen, an energy consultant who’s been exploring Namibia’s hydrogen potential since independence, believes this is reckless, especially given the country’s pressing needs in food, health care, and education. “We have a massive budget deficit,” he tells me. “We should not be binding resources to projects that might not end up leading anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like many Namibians I spoke to, von Oertzen thinks the government’s targets for hydrogen production, and jobs associated with it, are wildly unrealistic. At the same time, he and other critics believe there are ways in which the industry can contribute to national development. Despite his misgivings about the government’s support of Hyphen, he believes a desalination plant that the company plans to build could play an important role in combating local water shortages in Namibia’s sparsely populated south and, in turn, help draw more industry and people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raffinetti tells me that his company is also exploring the possibility of transmitting excess electricity from peak periods to the grid for local use. That may not put a major dent in the country’s electrification deficit, since the majority of Namibians who lack grid power live in the distant rural north. Still, some would like to see the government make more explicit demands from foreign investors to address local gaps. William Minnie, youth spokesperson for the Landless People’s Movement, an opposition party, believes it comes down to better negotiation. “If you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here,” he says, “we want our household problems to be solved.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some see Nandi-Ndaitwah’s arrival in office as a chance to forge a more pragmatic way forward. One goal outlined by her party during last year’s election campaign is “to increase rural electrification and ensure availability of affordable electricity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118678" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-dji-8.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Banks of solar panels at the HyIron Oshivela facility in the Namib Desert&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a ceremonial launch of HyIron’s plant in April, Nandi-Ndaitwah praised the project for opening a “new chapter in Namibia’s industrial history.” At the same time, she’s also pledged to move toward the extraction of oil and gas. Since 2022, firms exploring in the deep waters off Namibia’s coast have announced significant discoveries of those resources. The reserves might be too expensive to develop, and they don’t exactly position the country as a steward of the energy transition. Some observers, though, believe embracing fossil fuels could be a way to hedge against the uncertainty surrounding green hydrogen while lowering the costs of developing both. “If you take a combined approach, there’s a lot of infrastructure that can be shared between the two industries,” says Ekkehard Friedrich, a Windhoek-based investment advisor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all the questions about hydrogen that linger, there’s also a strong sense of anticipation. After my tour of HyIron, I drove for an hour, much of it along a desolate gravel road, to explore the nearest town. A faded desert settlement, Arandis was originally built to house employees of Rössing, an open-pit uranium mine that was once the largest in the world. There I met Joel Ochurub, 20, the son of a mine worker who’s studying to be a machinist. Jobs in Namibia, he told me, are “very scarce”; hydrogen might not create opportunities for everyone, he said, but the more industry Namibia can lure, the better. “When you see posts about green hydrogen on Instagram, there are so many likes,” he said. “People are excited.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan W.

Inside a building to Michels’s left sits a 12-megawatt electrolyzer—a machine resembling two giant AA batteries that is designed to split water into its two component parts, H₂ and O. Behind him is the desert factory’s key piece of proprietary tech: a rotating kiln in which the hydrogen gas from that water is mixed with iron ore to create a pure form of iron, the main ingredient in steel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Factories have used fossil fuels to process iron ore for three centuries, and the climate has paid a heavy price: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the steel industry today accounts for 8% of carbon dioxide emissions. Purifying the ore involves extracting iron that is bound to oxygen, and “removing the bond between the iron and oxygen requires a massive amount of energy,” says Michels, the 39-year-old CEO of HyIron, the startup behind the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it turns out there is a less carbon-­intensive alternative: using hydrogen to extract the iron. Unlike coal or natural gas, which release carbon dioxide as a by-product, this process, Michels explains, releases water. And if the hydrogen itself is “green”—meaning it’s made through renewable-­powered electrolysis rather than the conventional technique of mixing natural gas and steam—the climate impact of the entire process will be minimal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;HyIron, which began processing test batches of iron a month after my visit, is one of a handful of companies around the world that are betting green hydrogen can help the $1.8 trillion steel industry clean up its act. What sets it apart, above all, is its location. HyIron’s kiln was designed and prototyped in Germany, but the production site is in Namibia, more than 5,000 miles to the south. This former German colony, which was ruled by South Africa from 1915 to 1990, has little industry itself and is an ocean or two away from the world’s biggest importers of iron. What it does have is immense untapped potential for wind and solar power, which studies suggest could make it possible to produce hydrogen and its derivative products, like iron, ammonia, and low-carbon aviation fuel, as cheaply as is feasible anywhere. HyIron’s site in the Namib Desert, 50 miles from the Atlantic coast, averages just 30 hours of overcast skies per year, Michels tells me. The energy potential here, he says, is “incredible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michels, who trained as an economist and started HyIron as a side project when his family-owned safari lodge went quiet during the covid pandemic, isn’t the only Namibian with big plans for hydrogen. Since 2021, when the government identified the gas as a potentially “transformative strategic industry,” it’s become something of a national obsession. There are at least nine other projects planned or under construction, including one, in Namibia’s south, that’s among the largest proposed green hydrogen investments in the world. The Namibian government’s Green Hydrogen and Derivatives Strategy, released in 2022, envisions the creation of three “hydrogen valleys,” along the southern, central, and northern coasts, with a target production of 10 million to 12 million metric tons per year by 2050. That’s equivalent to more than 10% of all hydrogen made annually today. As soon as 2030, the strategy document claims, the industry could create 80,000 jobs and raise GDP by 30% through a combination of tax revenue, royalties, and the knock-on effect of so many investments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If even a fraction of this production comes to pass, it will give Namibia’s economy a major boost. But it is a gamble. Green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy, and long-term demand for its products remains uncertain. Pursuing a technology that isn’t yet commercially established, some critics fear, could strain government resources and distract from more urgent priorities, including the persistence of hunger and a domestic power grid that reaches only half of Namibia’s households. This is especially the case with the largest project under development, along the country’s southern coast, which will require at least $10 billion to get off the ground, a figure nearly as big as Namibia’s GDP today. That venture is contentious for environmental reasons, too: Under current plans, most of its infrastructure will be built inside a national park in a location Namibia’s top environmental watchdog calls the “most sensitive ecosystem in southern Africa.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Given the small country that we are, we’re risking quite a lot entering into this global race,” says Ronny Dempers, executive director of the Namibia Development Trust, which advocates for community-based management of natural resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding to the uncertainty is the death last year of Namibian president Hage Geingob, the hydrogen strategy’s chief political backer. The new president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who took office in March, hails from the same political party, but multiple people familiar with her thinking told me she’s keener on developing oil and natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, HyIron’s launch has given Namibia’s hydrogen ambitions a long-awaited jolt of momentum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question now is whether Namibia’s government, its trading partners, and hydrogen innovators like Michels can work together to build the industry in a way that satisfies the world’s appetite for cleaner fuels—and also helps improve lives at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The lightest element&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of powering the world with hydrogen is hardly new. In his 1874 novel &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Island&lt;/em&gt;, Jules Verne wrote that water, “decomposed” into hydrogen and oxygen, could function as the “coal of the future.” Not only is hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe, but H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, when burned, does not produce greenhouse gases and releases more energy per unit mass than any other nonradioactive fuel—roughly five times more than coal and three times more than gasoline or diesel. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen, pure hydrogen gas can’t readily be captured from the atmosphere—because it’s so light, it tends to escape into space. Instead, hydrogen must be sourced by splitting it off from other molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, the process has been anything but green: Most hydrogen made today, primarily for use in petroleum refining, fertilizers, and petrochemicals, is created through a process called steam methane reforming, in which high-temperature steam reacts with methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), releasing large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process. As a result, the IEA calls hydrogen today “more of a climate problem than a climate solution.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making hydrogen via electrolysis, as Verne described, was first achieved around 1800. But the process needs a lot of energy, and it wasn’t until the late 2010s, with the costs of wind and solar power falling and governments taking concrete steps to help keep global warming to a minimum, that commercial interest in splitting water with renewables began to emerge. A road map published by the IEA in 2023, which outlines a path to reaching net-zero ­emissions by midcentury, calls for dramatically expanded use of this “green” hydrogen. A portion of it would replace conventional “gray” hydrogen for existing uses. But the bulk would be for new applications, like iron and steel production, power generation, or long-haul transport—some fueled by hydrogen itself and others by derivatives like ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is made by fusing hydrogen with nitrogen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most rich countries have adopted policies that incentivize this shift. The European Union, for example, which has caps on fossil-fuel emissions in many sectors, mandates that 42% of hydrogen used by 2030 originate from renewable sources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118682" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Oshivela-Launch-45.jpg?w=1053" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, president of Namibia, speaks at a ceremonial opening for HyIron Oshivela in April.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118679" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-2.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Part of the facility’s 12-megawatt electrolyzer, which separates hydrogen from water&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118680" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-3.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After hydrogen gas is created in the electrolyzer, it is sent into liquid-gas separators, which remove residual water.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118681" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Oshivela-Launch-30.jpg?w=754" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Johannes Michels, CEO of HyIron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many African countries, this represents an opportunity. According to the IEA, the continent is home to 60% of the world’s best potential sites for solar power, thanks to its levels of year-round sunshine and quantity of land suitable for solar farms. The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance, a 10-country body formed in 2022, believes Africa can produce nearly a quarter of the hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives traded globally by 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A handful of North African countries, including Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, have tentative plans to send hydrogen to Europe via pipelines—some new, and some retrofitted from existing pipelines built to carry natural gas. Namibia’s distance from Europe makes pipeline transport economically prohibitive. Shipping H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, which takes up a lot of space even when stored in high-pressure tanks, wouldn’t be cost-competitive either. So Namibia’s plan is to use the hydrogen it makes to create iron, ammonia, and other products, which are dense enough to be transported by sea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The country’s biggest advantage is its especially strong wind and solar potential. Marco Raffinetti, CEO of Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, the firm developing the large-scale project in the south, believes that the company’s site there is one of the top three spots for hydrogen production in the world. The key, he says, is strong winds that peak at times when solar output is low, which minimizes power fluctuations and thus reduces costs. Namibia has other selling points as well, including vast tracts of sparsely populated land, a stable political climate, and a government open to new economic opportunities. The country’s GDP per capita, $4,168, ranks among the top 10 in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Namibia is also the world’s second most economically unequal society, in large part because of more than 40 years of rule under South African apartheid that included forced relocation. De facto segregation is still visible. Upmarket neighborhoods of the capital, Windhoek, home to a large share of the country’s white minority, resemble parts of suburban Los Angeles, with modernist houses on quiet tree-lined streets stretching into the surrounding hills. But much of the city’s population resides in an apartheid-era settlement known as Katutura, or “the place where we do not want to live.” Many of the homes here are corrugated-iron shacks without electricity or running water.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Namibia’s poverty is also a consequence of more recent economic stagnation. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita fell by 30% between 2012 and 2023. Uranium, one of the country’s largest exports, faced a decade-long slump as several countries reevaluated their use of nuclear power following the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima, Japan. Namibia’s fishing sector was hit with a major corruption scandal in 2019 that left two high-ranking officials in prison. Then came covid, which stifled tourism, and the country’s worst drought in a century, which left nearly half the population in need of aid; according to government figures, more than 1,100 people died of malnutrition between 2020 and 2024. Jobs are now scarcer than ever. As of 2023, according to the Namibia Statistics Agency, fewer than one in three people of working age were employed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It is in this context that Geingob, the late president, turned to hydrogen. A veteran of the independence struggle, Geingob had been elected in 2014 by promising to deliver prosperity. Instead, according to Robin Sherbourne, an economist who’s studied Namibia since the 1990s, growth continued to stagnate and support for his party began to wane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Green hydrogen was starting to take off, and Namibia had all the basic ingredients,” Sherbourne tells me. “So [Geingob] jumped at it. It gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‘Look, things are happening.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It gave him something to wave in front of the electorate and say, ‘Look, things are happening.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Robin Sherbourne, economist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Electrolyzers in the desert&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two and a half years after the release of the government’s Green Hydrogen Strategy, the industry is gradually coming to life. HyIron’s current setup, which cost €30 million (currently $34 million) and was financed in part by a grant from the German government, is capable of producing 15,000 metric tons of iron per year, roughly enough for 10,000 midsize cars or one large high-rise ­building. Michels hopes to scale that to 2 million metric tons by 2030, at an estimated cost of $2.7 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_17"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another project, developed by the Belgian shipping company CMB.Tech and the Namibian firm Ohlthaver &amp;amp; List, is working to produce trial amounts of hydrogen. In a second phase, it will trial generation of ammonia, which is primarily used today in fertilizers but could eventually be a key fuel for ocean-faring vessels. Ultimately the idea is to spend $3 billion on commercial-­scale ammonia production, aiming for 250,000 metric tons per year by the end of the decade, as well as a terminal at the port of Walvis Bay, where vessels rounding the southern tip of Africa will be able to bunker with the fuel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="aerial view of a solar array and facility" class="wp-image-1118676" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cleanergy_overview.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Near the port city of Walvis Bay, the Belgian shipping company CMB.Tech, in partnership with the Namibian firm Ohlthaver &amp;amp; List, has built a solar-powered plant to create hydrogen that can be dispensed as fuel. In the future, the venture will use hydrogen to produce ammonia, some of which will fuel CMB.Tech’s own oceanfaring vessels. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF CMB.TECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hyphen project, by contrast, exists for now mainly on paper. Although the company signed a concession agreement with Namibia’s government in 2023, it hasn’t yet secured the financing it needs to move ahead with construction. But if the project does come to life, it will be one of the world’s largest: Plans call for the installation of seven gigawatts of renewable power, more than 10 times Namibia’s current generation capacity, to produce 2 million metric tons of ammonia annually by 2030. According to Raffinetti, Hyphen plans to “overbuild” the accompanying infrastructure so it could also be used in future projects in the planned southern hydrogen valley. Meeting Namibia’s 2050 targets under the Green Hydrogen Strategy would require the equivalent&amp;nbsp;of 30 Hyphen-size projects spread across the three corridors of production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This planned footprint has already been the source of controversy. Hyphen’s concession—the land it has been granted access to—encompasses 18% of Tsau Khaeb National Park, a protected area about the size of Massachusetts that’s home to flamingos, African penguins, and 31 species of plants found nowhere else on Earth, many of them water-storing succulents that blanket the desert in majestic pastel-colored flowers when it rains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118675" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cleanergy_HydrogenAcademy.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The CMB.Tech project’s Hydrogen Academy has begun holding training sessions on hydrogen and how to handle it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF CMB.TECH&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris Brown, who leads the Namibia Chamber of Environment, a coalition of environmental NGOs, says the project would irreparably damage the “integrity and resilience” of the park. Raffinetti says Hyphen’s equipment will take up a small fraction of its concession and will be built in a “surgical way” to avoid the most ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But environmentalists are not the only ones who’ve criticized the choice of location. An expanded port, built to facilitate ammonia exports, will sit immediately adjacent to a site that housed a labor and extermination camp during Namibia’s 1904–1908 genocide, in which tens of thousands of Nama and Herero people were killed by German soldiers during a period of resistance to colonial rule. A 2024 report commissioned by Nama and Herero leaders argues that the extension of port infrastructure would “desecrate” the heritage of the area and those who died there. It doesn’t help the optics that Hyphen’s majority shareholder, the renewable power producer Enertrag, is a German company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond these sensitivities, Namibia’s broader hydrogen aspirations remain subject to many questions. While the country’s desert climate is ideal for generating power, the other key input for green hydrogen—water—is scarce. The central coastal region, where the HyIron and CMB.Tech projects (as well as several others in early-stage development) are based, already sources much of its water from a local seawater desalination plant that’s powered only in part by renewables. Other facilities are planned here and in the south, but some worry that hydrogen projects could face water-related bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here, we want our household problems to be solved.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;William Minnie, youth spokesperson, the Landless People’s Movement&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Namibia’s prospects also hinge on a global market for green fuels that’s highly precarious. Over the past few years, the hydrogen sector has gone from a period of “hype” to one of “disillusionment,” according to Martin Tengler, head of hydrogen research at BloombergNEF, which studies markets for new energy technologies. Absent incentives, Tengler is skeptical that green hydrogen will ever reach cost parity with gray hydrogen in most parts of the world. Certain industries, though, could embrace it even if it costs more. He notes that some higher-end automakers have already shown a willingness to pay a premium for green steel, even if it means a car’s price goes up by 2 or 3%. (Benteler, a German metals processing firm that supplies the automotive market, has committed to purchasing test quantities of green iron from HyIron.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Uncertainties also surround the future of ammonia. According to the IEA road map, ammonia made from green hydrogen could power 44% of global shipping by midcentury. But it, too, is likely to remain expensive relative to both conventional fuels and carbon-based alternatives like methanol and liquefied natural gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some in Namibia are especially worried about Hyphen, which has not yet signed any binding agreements with customers. In a bid to boost Hyphen’s attractiveness to other financiers, the government assumed a 24% ownership stake in the venture. The money it’s put in so far, roughly €24 million ($27&amp;nbsp;million), is covered by a Dutch government grant. But Namibia’s portion of construction would likely be financed through loans, exposing taxpayers to the project’s risks. Detlof von Oertzen, an energy consultant who’s been exploring Namibia’s hydrogen potential since independence, believes this is reckless, especially given the country’s pressing needs in food, health care, and education. “We have a massive budget deficit,” he tells me. “We should not be binding resources to projects that might not end up leading anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like many Namibians I spoke to, von Oertzen thinks the government’s targets for hydrogen production, and jobs associated with it, are wildly unrealistic. At the same time, he and other critics believe there are ways in which the industry can contribute to national development. Despite his misgivings about the government’s support of Hyphen, he believes a desalination plant that the company plans to build could play an important role in combating local water shortages in Namibia’s sparsely populated south and, in turn, help draw more industry and people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raffinetti tells me that his company is also exploring the possibility of transmitting excess electricity from peak periods to the grid for local use. That may not put a major dent in the country’s electrification deficit, since the majority of Namibians who lack grid power live in the distant rural north. Still, some would like to see the government make more explicit demands from foreign investors to address local gaps. William Minnie, youth spokesperson for the Landless People’s Movement, an opposition party, believes it comes down to better negotiation. “If you want your green hydrogen projects to be implemented here,” he says, “we want our household problems to be solved.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some see Nandi-Ndaitwah’s arrival in office as a chance to forge a more pragmatic way forward. One goal outlined by her party during last year’s election campaign is “to increase rural electrification and ensure availability of affordable electricity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118678" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HyIron-Feb-2025-dji-8.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Banks of solar panels at the HyIron Oshivela facility in the Namib Desert&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF HYIRON&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a ceremonial launch of HyIron’s plant in April, Nandi-Ndaitwah praised the project for opening a “new chapter in Namibia’s industrial history.” At the same time, she’s also pledged to move toward the extraction of oil and gas. Since 2022, firms exploring in the deep waters off Namibia’s coast have announced significant discoveries of those resources. The reserves might be too expensive to develop, and they don’t exactly position the country as a steward of the energy transition. Some observers, though, believe embracing fossil fuels could be a way to hedge against the uncertainty surrounding green hydrogen while lowering the costs of developing both. “If you take a combined approach, there’s a lot of infrastructure that can be shared between the two industries,” says Ekkehard Friedrich, a Windhoek-based investment advisor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For all the questions about hydrogen that linger, there’s also a strong sense of anticipation. After my tour of HyIron, I drove for an hour, much of it along a desolate gravel road, to explore the nearest town. A faded desert settlement, Arandis was originally built to house employees of Rössing, an open-pit uranium mine that was once the largest in the world. There I met Joel Ochurub, 20, the son of a mine worker who’s studying to be a machinist. Jobs in Namibia, he told me, are “very scarce”; hydrogen might not create opportunities for everyone, he said, but the more industry Namibia can lure, the better. “When you see posts about green hydrogen on Instagram, there are so many likes,” he said. “People are excited.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan W.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended a film festival dedicated to shorts made using generative AI. Dubbed AIFF 2025, it was an event precariously balancing between two different worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival was hosted by Runway, a company that produces models and tools for generating images and videos. In panels and press briefings, a curated list of industry professionals made the case for Hollywood to embrace AI tools. In private meetings with industry professionals, I gained a strong sense that there is already a widening philosophical divide within the film and television business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also interviewed Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela about the tightrope he walks as he pitches his products to an industry that has deeply divided feelings about what role AI will have in its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack all this, it makes sense to start with the films, partly because the film that was chosen as the festival's top prize winner says a lot about the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A festival of oddities and profundities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was the first time the festival has been open to the public, the crowd was a diverse mix: AI tech enthusiasts, working industry creatives, and folks who enjoy movies and who were curious about what they'd see—as well as quite a few people who fit into all three groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2102065 align-none"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="none large" height="474" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AIFF-2025-1024x474.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      The scene at the entrance to the theater at AIFF 2025 in Santa Monica, California.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The films shown were all short, and most would be more at home at an art film fest than something more mainstream. Some shorts featured an animated aesthetic (including one inspired by anime) and some presented as live action. There was even a documentary of sorts. The films could be made entirely with Runway or other AI tools, or those tools could simply be a key part of a stack that also includes more traditional filmmaking methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these shorts were quite weird. Most of us have seen by now that AI video-generation tools excel at producing surreal and distorted imagery—sometimes whether the person prompting the tool wants that or not. Several of these films leaned into that limitation, treating it as a strength.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing that camp was Vallée Duhamel's &lt;em&gt;Fragments of Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, which visually explored the notion of multiple dimensions bleeding into one another. Cars morphed into the sides of houses, and humanoid figures, purported to be inter-dimensional travelers, moved in ways that defied anatomy. While I found this film visually compelling at times, I wasn't seeing much in it that I hadn't already seen from dreamcore or horror AI video TikTok creators like GLUMLOT or SinRostroz in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More compelling were shorts that used this propensity for oddity to generate imagery that was curated and thematically tied to some aspect of human experience or identity. For example, &lt;em&gt;More Tears than Harm&lt;/em&gt; by Herinarivo Rakotomanana was a rotoscope animation-style "sensory collage of childhood memories" of growing up in Madagascar. Its specificity and consistent styling lent it a credibility that &lt;em&gt;Fragments of Nowhere&lt;/em&gt; didn't achieve. I also enjoyed Riccardo Fusetti's &lt;em&gt;Editorial&lt;/em&gt; on this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;More Tears Than Harm&lt;/em&gt;, an unusual animated film at AIFF 2025.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 10 films in the festival, two clearly stood above the others in my impressions—and they ended up being the Grand Prix and Gold prize winners. (The judging panel included filmmakers Gaspar Noé and Harmony Korine, Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal, IMAX head of post and image capture Bruce Markoe, Lionsgate VFX SVP Brianna Domont, Nvidia developer relations lead Richard Kerris, and Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela, among others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up &lt;em&gt;Jailbird&lt;/em&gt; was the aforementioned quasi-documentary. Directed by Andrew Salter, it was a brief piece that introduced viewers to a program in the UK that places chickens in human prisons as companion animals, to positive effect. Why make that film with AI, you might ask? Well, AI was used to achieve shots that wouldn't otherwise be doable for a small-budget film to depict the experience from the chicken's point of view. The crowd loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Jailbird&lt;/em&gt;, the runner-up&amp;nbsp;at AIFF 2025.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the Grand Prix winner, Jacob Adler's Total Pixel Space, which was, among other things, a philosophical defense of the very idea of AI art. You can watch &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt; on YouTube right now, unlike some of the other films. I found it strangely moving, even as I saw its selection as the festival's top winner with some cynicism. Of course they'd pick that one, I thought, although I agreed it was the most interesting of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it risked navel-gazing and self-congratulation in this venue, &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt; was filled with compelling imagery that matched the themes, and it touched on some genuinely interesting ideas—at times, it seemed almost profound, didactic as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How many images can possibly exist?" the film's narrator asked. To answer that, it explains the concept of total pixel space, which actually reflects how image generation tools work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixels are the building blocks of digital images—tiny tiles forming a mosaic. Each pixel is defined by numbers representing color and position. Therefore, any digital image can be represented as a sequence of numbers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we don't need to write down every number between zero and one to prove they exist, we don't need to generate every possible image to prove they exist. Their existence is guaranteed by the mathematics that defines them... Every frame of every possible film exists as coordinates... To deny this would be to deny the existence of numbers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine-minute film demonstrates that the number of possible images or films is greater than the number of atoms in the universe and argues that photographers and filmmakers may be seen as discovering images that already exist in the possibility space rather than creating something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within that framework, it's easy to argue that generative AI is just another way for artists to "discover" images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The balancing act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are all—and I include myself in that group as well—obsessed with technology, and we keep chatting about models and data sets and training and capabilities," Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela said to me when we spoke the next morning. "But if you look back and take a minute, the festival was celebrating filmmakers and artists."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admitted that I found myself moved by &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt;'s articulations. "The winner would never have thought of himself as a filmmaker, and he made a film that made you feel something," Valenzuela responded. "I feel that's very powerful. And the reason he could do it was because he had access to something that just wasn't possible a couple of months ago."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-time and outsider filmmakers were the focus of AIFF 2025, but Runway works with established studios, too—and those relationships have an inherent tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has signed deals with companies like Lionsgate and AMC. In some cases, it trains on data provided by those companies; in others, it embeds within them to try to develop tools that fit how they already work. That's not something competitors like OpenAI are doing yet, so that, combined with a head start in video generation, has allowed Runway to grow and stay competitive so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We go directly into the companies, and we have teams of creatives that are working alongside them. We basically embed ourselves within the organizations that we're working with very deeply," Valenzuela explained. "We do versions of our film festival internally for teams as well so they can go through the process of making something and seeing the potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2018 at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts by two Chileans and one Greek co-founder, Runway has a very different story than its Silicon Valley competitors. It was one of the first to bring an actually usable video-generation tool to the masses. Runway also contributed in foundational ways to the popular Stable Diffusion model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is vastly outspent by competitors like OpenAI, it has taken a hands-on approach to working with existing industries. You won't hear Valenzuela or other Runway leaders talking about the imminence of AGI or anything so lofty; instead, it's all about selling the product as something that can solve existing problems in creatives' workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, an artist's mindset and relationships within the industry don't negate some fundamental conflicts. There are multiple intellectual property cases involving Runway and its peers, and though the company hasn't admitted it, there is evidence that it trained its models on copyrighted YouTube videos, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valenzuela suggested that studios are worried about liability, not underlying principles, though, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the concerns on copyright are on the output side, which is like, how do you make sure that the model doesn't create something that already exists or infringes on something. And I think for that, we've made sure our models don't and are supportive of the creative direction you want to take without being too limiting. We work with every major studio, and we offer them indemnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, he has also defended Runway by saying that what it's producing is not a re-creation of what has come before. He sees the tool's generative process as distinct—legally, creatively, and ethically—from simply pulling up assets or references from a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People believe AI is sort of like a system that creates and conjures things magically with no input from users," he said. "And it's not. You have to do that work. You still are involved, and you're still responsible as a user in terms of how you use it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seemed to share this defense of AI as a legitimate tool for artists with conviction, but given that he's been pitching these products directly to working filmmakers, he was also clearly aware that not everyone agrees with him. There is not even a consensus among those in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An industry divided&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in LA for the event, I visited separately with two of my oldest friends. Both of them work in the film and television industry in similar disciplines. They each asked what I was in town for, and I told them I was there to cover an AI film festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One immediately responded with a grimace of disgust, "Oh, yikes, I'm sorry." The other responded with bright eyes and intense interest and began telling me how he already uses AI in his day-to-day to do things like extend shots by a second or two for a better edit, and expressed frustration at his company for not adopting the tools faster.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Neither is alone in their attitudes. Hollywood is divided—and not for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been seismic technological changes in the film industry before. There was the transition from silent films to talkies, obviously; moviemaking transformed into an entirely different art. Numerous old jobs were lost, and numerous new jobs were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, there was the transition from film to digital projection, which may be an even tighter parallel. It was a major disruption, with some companies and careers collapsing while others rose. There were people saying, "Why do we even need this?" while others believed it was the only sane way forward. Some audiences declared the quality worse, and others said it was better. There were analysts arguing it could be stopped, while others insisted it was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMAX's head of post production, Bruce Markoe, spoke briefly about that history at a press mixer before the festival. "It was a little scary," he recalled. "It was a big, fundamental change that we were going through."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People ultimately embraced it, though. "The motion picture and television industry has always been very technology-forward, and they've always used new technologies to advance the state of the art and improve the efficiencies," Markoe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether he thinks the same thing will happen with generative AI tools, he said, "I think some filmmakers are going to embrace it faster than others." He pointed to AI tools' usefulness for pre-visualization as particularly valuable and noted some people are already using it that way, but it will take time for people to get comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, many, many filmmakers are still loudly skeptical. "The &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of AI is great," &lt;em&gt;The Mitchells vs. the Machines&lt;/em&gt; director Mike Rianda said in a Wired interview. "But in the hands of a corporation, it is like a buzzsaw that will destroy us all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are interested in the technology but are concerned that it's being brought into the industry too quickly, with insufficient planning and protections. That includes Crafty Apes Senior VFX Supervisor Luke DiTomasso. "&lt;span class="mVzZr"&gt;How fast do we roll out AI technologies without really having an understanding of them?" he asked in an interview with Production Designers Collective. "There’s a potential for AI to accelerate beyond what we might be comfortable with, so I do have some trepidation and am maybe not gung-ho about all aspects of it.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Others remain skeptical that the tools will be as useful as some optimists believe. "AI never passed on anything. It loved everything it read. It wants you to win. But storytelling requires nuance—subtext, emotion, what’s left unsaid. That’s something AI simply can’t replicate," said Alegre Rodriquez, a member of the Emerging Technology committee at the Motion Picture Editors Guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mirror&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying back from Los Angeles, I considered two key differences between this generative AI inflection point for Hollywood and the silent/talkie or film/digital transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, neither of those transitions involved an existential threat to the technology on the basis of intellectual property and copyright. Valenzuela talked about what matters to studio heads—protection from liability over the outputs. But the countless creatives who are critical of these tools also believe they should be consulted and even compensated for their work's use in the training data for Runway's models. In other words, it's not just about the outputs, it's also about the sourcing. As noted before, there are several cases underway. We don't know where they'll land yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there's a more cultural and philosophical issue at play, which Valenzuela himself touched on in our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think AI has become this sort of mirror where anyone can project all their fears and anxieties, but also their optimism and ideas of the future," he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to scroll for long to come across techno-utopians declaring with no evidence that AGI is right around the corner and that it will cure cancer and save our society. You also don't have to scroll long to encounter visceral anger at every generative AI company from people declaring the technology—which is essentially just a new methodology for programming a computer—fundamentally unethical and harmful, with apocalyptic societal and economic ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid all those bold declarations, this film festival put the focus on the on-the-ground reality. First-time filmmakers who might never have previously cleared Hollywood's gatekeepers are getting screened at festivals because they can create competitive-looking work with a fraction of the crew and hours. Studios and the people who work there are saying they're saving time, resources, and headaches in pre-viz, editing, visual effects, and other work that's usually done under immense time and resource pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are not paying attention to the very huge amount of positive outcomes of this technology,” Valenzuela told me, pointing to those examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this online discussion ecosystem that elevates outrage above everything else, that's likely true. Still, there is a sincere and rigorous conviction among many creatives that their work is contributing to this technology's capabilities without credit or compensation and that the structural and legal frameworks to ensure minimal human harm in this evolving period of disruption are still inadequate. That's why we've seen groups like the Writers Guild of America West support the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act and other similar legislation meant to increase transparency about how these models are trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The philosophical question with a legal answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning film argued that "total pixel space represents both the ultimate determinism and the ultimate freedom—every possibility existing simultaneously, waiting for consciousness to give it meaning through the act of choice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making this statement, the film suggested that creativity, above all else, is an act of curation. It's a claim that nothing, truly, is original. It's a distillation of human expression into the language of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many, that philosophy rings undeniably true: Every possibility already exists, and artists are just collapsing the waveform to the frame they want to reveal. To others, there is more personal truth to the romantic ideal that artwork is valued precisely because it did not exist until the artist produced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that the debate about creativity and AI in Hollywood is ultimately a philosophical one. But it won't be resolved that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry may succumb to litigation fatigue and a hollowed-out workforce—or it may instead find its way to fair deals, new opportunities for fresh voices, and transparent training sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all this lofty talk about creativity and ideas, the outcome will come down to the contracts, court decisions, and compensation structures—all things that have always been at least as big a part of Hollywood as the creative work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended a film festival dedicated to shorts made using generative AI. Dubbed AIFF 2025, it was an event precariously balancing between two different worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival was hosted by Runway, a company that produces models and tools for generating images and videos. In panels and press briefings, a curated list of industry professionals made the case for Hollywood to embrace AI tools. In private meetings with industry professionals, I gained a strong sense that there is already a widening philosophical divide within the film and television business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also interviewed Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela about the tightrope he walks as he pitches his products to an industry that has deeply divided feelings about what role AI will have in its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack all this, it makes sense to start with the films, partly because the film that was chosen as the festival's top prize winner says a lot about the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A festival of oddities and profundities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was the first time the festival has been open to the public, the crowd was a diverse mix: AI tech enthusiasts, working industry creatives, and folks who enjoy movies and who were curious about what they'd see—as well as quite a few people who fit into all three groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2102065 align-none"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="none large" height="474" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AIFF-2025-1024x474.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The films shown were all short, and most would be more at home at an art film fest than something more mainstream. Some shorts featured an animated aesthetic (including one inspired by anime) and some presented as live action. There was even a documentary of sorts. The films could be made entirely with Runway or other AI tools, or those tools could simply be a key part of a stack that also includes more traditional filmmaking methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these shorts were quite weird. Most of us have seen by now that AI video-generation tools excel at producing surreal and distorted imagery—sometimes whether the person prompting the tool wants that or not. Several of these films leaned into that limitation, treating it as a strength.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Representing that camp was Vallée Duhamel's &lt;em&gt;Fragments of Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, which visually explored the notion of multiple dimensions bleeding into one another. Cars morphed into the sides of houses, and humanoid figures, purported to be inter-dimensional travelers, moved in ways that defied anatomy. While I found this film visually compelling at times, I wasn't seeing much in it that I hadn't already seen from dreamcore or horror AI video TikTok creators like GLUMLOT or SinRostroz in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More compelling were shorts that used this propensity for oddity to generate imagery that was curated and thematically tied to some aspect of human experience or identity. For example, &lt;em&gt;More Tears than Harm&lt;/em&gt; by Herinarivo Rakotomanana was a rotoscope animation-style "sensory collage of childhood memories" of growing up in Madagascar. Its specificity and consistent styling lent it a credibility that &lt;em&gt;Fragments of Nowhere&lt;/em&gt; didn't achieve. I also enjoyed Riccardo Fusetti's &lt;em&gt;Editorial&lt;/em&gt; on this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;More Tears Than Harm&lt;/em&gt;, an unusual animated film at AIFF 2025.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 10 films in the festival, two clearly stood above the others in my impressions—and they ended up being the Grand Prix and Gold prize winners. (The judging panel included filmmakers Gaspar Noé and Harmony Korine, Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal, IMAX head of post and image capture Bruce Markoe, Lionsgate VFX SVP Brianna Domont, Nvidia developer relations lead Richard Kerris, and Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela, among others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up &lt;em&gt;Jailbird&lt;/em&gt; was the aforementioned quasi-documentary. Directed by Andrew Salter, it was a brief piece that introduced viewers to a program in the UK that places chickens in human prisons as companion animals, to positive effect. Why make that film with AI, you might ask? Well, AI was used to achieve shots that wouldn't otherwise be doable for a small-budget film to depict the experience from the chicken's point of view. The crowd loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Jailbird&lt;/em&gt;, the runner-up&amp;nbsp;at AIFF 2025.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the Grand Prix winner, Jacob Adler's Total Pixel Space, which was, among other things, a philosophical defense of the very idea of AI art. You can watch &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt; on YouTube right now, unlike some of the other films. I found it strangely moving, even as I saw its selection as the festival's top winner with some cynicism. Of course they'd pick that one, I thought, although I agreed it was the most interesting of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it risked navel-gazing and self-congratulation in this venue, &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt; was filled with compelling imagery that matched the themes, and it touched on some genuinely interesting ideas—at times, it seemed almost profound, didactic as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How many images can possibly exist?" the film's narrator asked. To answer that, it explains the concept of total pixel space, which actually reflects how image generation tools work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixels are the building blocks of digital images—tiny tiles forming a mosaic. Each pixel is defined by numbers representing color and position. Therefore, any digital image can be represented as a sequence of numbers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we don't need to write down every number between zero and one to prove they exist, we don't need to generate every possible image to prove they exist. Their existence is guaranteed by the mathematics that defines them... Every frame of every possible film exists as coordinates... To deny this would be to deny the existence of numbers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine-minute film demonstrates that the number of possible images or films is greater than the number of atoms in the universe and argues that photographers and filmmakers may be seen as discovering images that already exist in the possibility space rather than creating something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within that framework, it's easy to argue that generative AI is just another way for artists to "discover" images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The balancing act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are all—and I include myself in that group as well—obsessed with technology, and we keep chatting about models and data sets and training and capabilities," Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela said to me when we spoke the next morning. "But if you look back and take a minute, the festival was celebrating filmmakers and artists."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admitted that I found myself moved by &lt;em&gt;Total Pixel Space&lt;/em&gt;'s articulations. "The winner would never have thought of himself as a filmmaker, and he made a film that made you feel something," Valenzuela responded. "I feel that's very powerful. And the reason he could do it was because he had access to something that just wasn't possible a couple of months ago."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-time and outsider filmmakers were the focus of AIFF 2025, but Runway works with established studios, too—and those relationships have an inherent tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has signed deals with companies like Lionsgate and AMC. In some cases, it trains on data provided by those companies; in others, it embeds within them to try to develop tools that fit how they already work. That's not something competitors like OpenAI are doing yet, so that, combined with a head start in video generation, has allowed Runway to grow and stay competitive so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We go directly into the companies, and we have teams of creatives that are working alongside them. We basically embed ourselves within the organizations that we're working with very deeply," Valenzuela explained. "We do versions of our film festival internally for teams as well so they can go through the process of making something and seeing the potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2018 at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts by two Chileans and one Greek co-founder, Runway has a very different story than its Silicon Valley competitors. It was one of the first to bring an actually usable video-generation tool to the masses. Runway also contributed in foundational ways to the popular Stable Diffusion model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is vastly outspent by competitors like OpenAI, it has taken a hands-on approach to working with existing industries. You won't hear Valenzuela or other Runway leaders talking about the imminence of AGI or anything so lofty; instead, it's all about selling the product as something that can solve existing problems in creatives' workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, an artist's mindset and relationships within the industry don't negate some fundamental conflicts. There are multiple intellectual property cases involving Runway and its peers, and though the company hasn't admitted it, there is evidence that it trained its models on copyrighted YouTube videos, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the concerns on copyright are on the output side, which is like, how do you make sure that the model doesn't create something that already exists or infringes on something. And I think for that, we've made sure our models don't and are supportive of the creative direction you want to take without being too limiting. We work with every major studio, and we offer them indemnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, he has also defended Runway by saying that what it's producing is not a re-creation of what has come before. He sees the tool's generative process as distinct—legally, creatively, and ethically—from simply pulling up assets or references from a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People believe AI is sort of like a system that creates and conjures things magically with no input from users," he said. "And it's not. You have to do that work. You still are involved, and you're still responsible as a user in terms of how you use it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seemed to share this defense of AI as a legitimate tool for artists with conviction, but given that he's been pitching these products directly to working filmmakers, he was also clearly aware that not everyone agrees with him. There is not even a consensus among those in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An industry divided&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in LA for the event, I visited separately with two of my oldest friends. Both of them work in the film and television industry in similar disciplines. They each asked what I was in town for, and I told them I was there to cover an AI film festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One immediately responded with a grimace of disgust, "Oh, yikes, I'm sorry." The other responded with bright eyes and intense interest and began telling me how he already uses AI in his day-to-day to do things like extend shots by a second or two for a better edit, and expressed frustration at his company for not adopting the tools faster.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Neither is alone in their attitudes. Hollywood is divided—and not for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been seismic technological changes in the film industry before. There was the transition from silent films to talkies, obviously; moviemaking transformed into an entirely different art. Numerous old jobs were lost, and numerous new jobs were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, there was the transition from film to digital projection, which may be an even tighter parallel. It was a major disruption, with some companies and careers collapsing while others rose. There were people saying, "Why do we even need this?" while others believed it was the only sane way forward. Some audiences declared the quality worse, and others said it was better. There were analysts arguing it could be stopped, while others insisted it was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMAX's head of post production, Bruce Markoe, spoke briefly about that history at a press mixer before the festival. "It was a little scary," he recalled. "It was a big, fundamental change that we were going through."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People ultimately embraced it, though. "The motion picture and television industry has always been very technology-forward, and they've always used new technologies to advance the state of the art and improve the efficiencies," Markoe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether he thinks the same thing will happen with generative AI tools, he said, "I think some filmmakers are going to embrace it faster than others." He pointed to AI tools' usefulness for pre-visualization as particularly valuable and noted some people are already using it that way, but it will take time for people to get comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, many, many filmmakers are still loudly skeptical. "The &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of AI is great," &lt;em&gt;The Mitchells vs. the Machines&lt;/em&gt; director Mike Rianda said in a Wired interview. "But in the hands of a corporation, it is like a buzzsaw that will destroy us all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are interested in the technology but are concerned that it's being brought into the industry too quickly, with insufficient planning and protections. That includes Crafty Apes Senior VFX Supervisor Luke DiTomasso. "&lt;span class="mVzZr"&gt;How fast do we roll out AI technologies without really having an understanding of them?" he asked in an interview with Production Designers Collective. "There’s a potential for AI to accelerate beyond what we might be comfortable with, so I do have some trepidation and am maybe not gung-ho about all aspects of it.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Others remain skeptical that the tools will be as useful as some optimists believe. "AI never passed on anything. It loved everything it read. It wants you to win. But storytelling requires nuance—subtext, emotion, what’s left unsaid. That’s something AI simply can’t replicate," said Alegre Rodriquez, a member of the Emerging Technology committee at the Motion Picture Editors Guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mirror&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying back from Los Angeles, I considered two key differences between this generative AI inflection point for Hollywood and the silent/talkie or film/digital transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, neither of those transitions involved an existential threat to the technology on the basis of intellectual property and copyright. Valenzuela talked about what matters to studio heads—protection from liability over the outputs. But the countless creatives who are critical of these tools also believe they should be consulted and even compensated for their work's use in the training data for Runway's models. In other words, it's not just about the outputs, it's also about the sourcing. As noted before, there are several cases underway. We don't know where they'll land yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there's a more cultural and philosophical issue at play, which Valenzuela himself touched on in our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think AI has become this sort of mirror where anyone can project all their fears and anxieties, but also their optimism and ideas of the future," he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to scroll for long to come across techno-utopians declaring with no evidence that AGI is right around the corner and that it will cure cancer and save our society. You also don't have to scroll long to encounter visceral anger at every generative AI company from people declaring the technology—which is essentially just a new methodology for programming a computer—fundamentally unethical and harmful, with apocalyptic societal and economic ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid all those bold declarations, this film festival put the focus on the on-the-ground reality. First-time filmmakers who might never have previously cleared Hollywood's gatekeepers are getting screened at festivals because they can create competitive-looking work with a fraction of the crew and hours. Studios and the people who work there are saying they're saving time, resources, and headaches in pre-viz, editing, visual effects, and other work that's usually done under immense time and resource pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;“People are not paying attention to the very huge amount of positive outcomes of this technology,” Valenzuela told me, pointing to those examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this online discussion ecosystem that elevates outrage above everything else, that's likely true. Still, there is a sincere and rigorous conviction among many creatives that their work is contributing to this technology's capabilities without credit or compensation and that the structural and legal frameworks to ensure minimal human harm in this evolving period of disruption are still inadequate. That's why we've seen groups like the Writers Guild of America West support the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act and other similar legislation meant to increase transparency about how these models are trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The philosophical question with a legal answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning film argued that "total pixel space represents both the ultimate determinism and the ultimate freedom—every possibility existing simultaneously, waiting for consciousness to give it meaning through the act of choice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making this statement, the film suggested that creativity, above all else, is an act of curation. It's a claim that nothing, truly, is original. It's a distillation of human expression into the language of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many, that philosophy rings undeniably true: Every possibility already exists, and artists are just collapsing the waveform to the frame they want to reveal. To others, there is more personal truth to the romantic ideal that artwork is valued precisely because it did not exist until the artist produced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that the debate about creativity and AI in Hollywood is ultimately a philosophical one. But it won't be resolved that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry may succumb to litigation fatigue and a hollowed-out workforce—or it may instead find its way to fair deals, new opportunities for fresh voices, and transparent training sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all this lofty talk about creativity and ideas, the outcome will come down to the contracts, court decisions, and compensation structures—all things that have always been at least as big a part of Hollywood as the creative work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike coal or natural gas, which release carbon dioxide as a by-product, this process releases water. And if the hydrogen itself is “green,” the climate impact of the entire process will be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HyIron, which has a site in the Namib desert, is one of a handful of companies around the world that are betting green hydrogen can help the $1.8 trillion steel industry clean up its act. The question now is whether Namibia’s government, its trading partners, and hydrogen innovators can work together to build the industry in a way that satisfies the world’s appetite for cleaner fuels—and also helps improve lives at home.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we fix AI’s evaluation crisis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every time a company launches a new AI model, its scores show it beating the capabilities of predecessors. On paper, everything appears to be getting better all the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, it’s not so simple. In fact, many now openly admit that the process of testing AI, using sets of exam-style questions called benchmarks, is broken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, a growing number of teams around the world are trying to address the AI evaluation crisis. One of them is Xbench, a benchmark project developed by HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China). It evaluates models not only on the ability to pass arbitrary tests, like most other benchmarks, but also on the ability to execute real-world tasks, which is more unusual. It’s also updated on a regular basis to try to keep it evergreen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Read more about Xbench in our story, and more about the broader efforts to tackle the evaluation crisis in this week’s edition of The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter about the latest goings-on in the world of AI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Caiwei Chen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne.

That’s because there are still so many unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders.

Unlike coal or natural gas, which release carbon dioxide as a by-product, this process releases water. And if the hydrogen itself is “green,” the climate impact of the entire process will be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HyIron, which has a site in the Namib desert, is one of a handful of companies around the world that are betting green hydrogen can help the $1.8 trillion steel industry clean up its act. The question now is whether Namibia’s government, its trading partners, and hydrogen innovators can work together to build the industry in a way that satisfies the world’s appetite for cleaner fuels—and also helps improve lives at home.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we fix AI’s evaluation crisis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every time a company launches a new AI model, its scores show it beating the capabilities of predecessors. On paper, everything appears to be getting better all the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, it’s not so simple. In fact, many now openly admit that the process of testing AI, using sets of exam-style questions called benchmarks, is broken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, a growing number of teams around the world are trying to address the AI evaluation crisis. One of them is Xbench, a benchmark project developed by HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China). It evaluates models not only on the ability to pass arbitrary tests, like most other benchmarks, but also on the ability to execute real-world tasks, which is more unusual. It’s also updated on a regular basis to try to keep it evergreen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Read more about Xbench in our story, and more about the broader efforts to tackle the evaluation crisis in this week’s edition of The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter about the latest goings-on in the world of AI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Caiwei Chen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
