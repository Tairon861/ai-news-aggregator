          &lt;p&gt;AI search engine Perplexity is using stealth bots and other tactics to evade websites’ no-crawl directives, an allegation that if true violates Internet norms that have been in place for more than three decades, network security and optimization service Cloudflare said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, Cloudflare researchers said the company received complaints from customers who had disallowed Perplexity scraping bots by implementing settings in their sites’ robots.txt files and through Web application firewalls that blocked the declared Perplexity crawlers. Despite those steps, Cloudflare said, Perplexity continued to access the sites’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said they then set out to test it for themselves and found that when known Perplexity crawlers encountered blocks from robots.txt files or firewall rules, Perplexity then searched the sites using a stealth bot that followed a range of tactics to mask its activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;gt;10,000 domains and millions of requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This undeclared crawler utilized multiple IPs not listed in Perplexity’s official IP range, and would rotate through these IPs in response to the restrictive robots.txt policy and block from Cloudflare," the researchers wrote. “In addition to rotating IPs, we observed requests coming from different ASNs in attempts to further evade website blocks. This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers provided the following diagram to illustrate the flow of the technique they allege Perplexity used.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If true, the evasion flouts Internet norms in place for more than three decades. In 1994, engineer Martijn Koster proposed the Robots Exclusion Protocol, which provided a machine-readable format for informing crawlers they weren’t permitted on a given site. Sites that their content indexed installed the simple robots.txt file at the top of their homepage. The standard, which has been widely observed and endorsed ever since, formally became a standard under the Internet Engineering Task Force in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare isn’t the first to say that Perplexity violates the spirit if not the letter of the norm. Last year, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The Verge that stopping Perplexity—and two other AI engines from Microsoft and Anthropic—was a real pain in the ass.” Huffman went on to say: “We’ve had Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity act as though all of the content on the Internet is free for them to use. That’s their real position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perplexity has faced allegations from several other publishers that it plagiarized their content. Forbes, for instance, accused Perplexity of “cynical theft” after publishing a post that was “extremely similar to Forbes’ proprietary article” posted a day earlier. Ars Technica sister publication Wired has leveled similar claims. It cited what it said were suspicious traffic patterns from IP addresses, likely linked to Perplexity, that were ignoring robots.txt exclusions. Perplexity was also found to have manipulated its crawling bots' ID string to bypass website blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare researchers said that in response to their findings, the company is taking actions to prevent crawlers from accessing sites that use its content-delivery service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are clear preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and preferences,” they wrote. “Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this stealth crawling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perplexity representatives didn’t respond to an email asking if the allegations are true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Heather Adkins, Google’s vice president of security, announced Monday that its LLM-based vulnerability researcher Big Sleep found and reported 20 flaws in various popular open source software.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adkins said that Big Sleep, which is developed by the company’s AI department DeepMind as well as its elite team of hackers Project Zero, reported its first-ever vulnerabilities, mostly in open source software such as audio and video library FFmpeg and image-editing suite ImageMagick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given that the vulnerabilities are not fixed yet, we don’t have details of their impact or severity, as Google does not yet want to provide details, which is a standard policy when waiting for bugs to be fixed. But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google’s spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of engineering, wrote on X that the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities are already a reality. Other than Big Sleep, there’s RunSybil and XBOW, among others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;XBOW has garnered headlines after it reached the top of one of the U.S. leaderboards at bug bounty platform HackerOne. It’s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they’re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained of bug reports that are actually hallucinations, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Escher’s artwork is a gateway into a world of depth-defying optical illusions, featuring “impossible objects” that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries. What you perceive his illustrations to be depends on your point of view — for example, a person seemingly walking upstairs may be heading down the steps if you tilt your head&amp;nbsp;sideways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer graphics scientists and designers can recreate these illusions in 3D, but only by bending or cutting a real shape and positioning it at a particular angle. This workaround has downsides, though: Changing the smoothness or lighting of the structure will expose that it isn’t actually an optical illusion, which also means you can’t accurately solve geometry problems on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a unique approach to represent “impossible” objects in a more versatile way. Their “Meschers” tool converts images and 3D models into 2.5-dimensional structures, creating Escher-like depictions of things like windows, buildings, and even donuts. The approach helps users relight, smooth out, and study unique geometries while preserving their optical illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool could assist geometry researchers with calculating the distance between two points on a curved impossible surface (“geodesics”) and simulating how heat dissipates over it (“heat diffusion”). It could also help artists and computer graphics scientists create physics-breaking designs in multiple dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author and MIT PhD student Ana Dodik aims to design computer graphics tools that aren’t limited to replicating reality, enabling artists to express their intent independently of whether a shape can be realized in the physical world. “Using Meschers, we’ve unlocked a new class of shapes for artists to work with on the computer,” she says. “They could also help perception scientists understand the point at which an object truly becomes impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dodik and her colleagues will present their&amp;nbsp;paper at the SIGGRAPH conference in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making impossible objects possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Impossible objects can’t be fully replicated in 3D. Their constituent parts often look plausible, but these parts don’t glue together properly when assembled in 3D. But what can be computationally imitated, as the CSAIL researchers found out, is the process of how we perceive these shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the&amp;nbsp;Penrose Triangle, for instance. The object as a whole is physically impossible because the depths don’t “add up,” but we can recognize real-world 3D shapes (like its three L-shaped corners) within it. These smaller regions can be realized in 3D — a property called “local consistency” — but when we try to assemble them together, they don’t form a globally consistent shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meschers approach models’ locally consistent regions without forcing them to be globally consistent, piecing together an Escher-esque structure. Behind the scenes, Meschers represents impossible objects as if we know their x and y coordinates in the image, as well as differences in z coordinates (depth) between neighboring pixels; the tool uses these differences in depth to reason about impossible objects indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many uses of Meschers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to rendering impossible objects, Meschers can subdivide their structures into smaller shapes for more precise geometry calculations and smoothing operations. This process enabled the researchers to reduce visual imperfections of impossible shapes, such as a red heart outline they thinned out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested their tool on an “impossibagel,” where a bagel is shaded in a physically impossible way. Meschers helped Dodik and her colleagues simulate heat diffusion and calculate geodesic distances between different points of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you’re an ant traversing this bagel, and you want to know how long it’ll take you to get across, for example,” says Dodik. “In the same way, our tool could help mathematicians analyze the underlying geometry of impossible shapes up close, much like how we study real-world ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Much like a magician, the tool can create optical illusions out of otherwise practical objects, making it easier for computer graphics artists to create impossible objects. It can also use “inverse rendering” tools to convert drawings and images of impossible objects into high-dimensional designs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meschers demonstrates how computer graphics tools don’t have to be constrained by the rules of physical reality,” says senior author Justin Solomon, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and leader of the CSAIL Geometric Data Processing Group. “Incredibly, artists using Meschers can reason about shapes that we will never find in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meschers can also aid computer graphics artists with tweaking the shading of their creations, while still preserving an optical illusion. This versatility would allow creatives to change the lighting of their art to depict a wider variety of scenes (like a sunrise or sunset) — as Meschers demonstrated by relighting a model of a dog on a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite its versatility, Meschers is just the start for Dodik and her colleagues. The team is considering designing an interface to make the tool easier to use while building more elaborate scenes. They’re also working with perception scientists to see how the computer graphics tool can be used more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dodik and Solomon wrote the paper with CSAIL affiliates Isabella Yu ’24, SM ’25; PhD student Kartik Chandra SM ’23; MIT professors Jonathan Ragan-Kelley and Joshua Tenenbaum; and MIT Assistant Professor Vincent Sitzmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work was supported, in part, by the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Mathworks Fellowship, the Hertz Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Schmidt Sciences AI2050 fellowship, MIT Quest for Intelligence, the U.S. Army Research Office, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL initiative, Google, the MIT–IBM Watson AI Laboratory, from the Toyota–CSAIL Joint Research Center, Adobe Systems, the Singapore Defence Science and Technology Agency, and the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT will reach 700 million weekly active users this week, the company announced Monday, cementing its position as one of the fastest-adopted software products in history just as the company prepares to release its most powerful language model yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge is a 40 percent jump from the 500 million weekly users ChatGPT had at the end of March and marks a fourfold increase from the same period last year. The explosive growth rivals the adoption rates of platforms like Zoom during the pandemic and early social media networks, underscoring how quickly AI tools have moved from experimental to essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The milestone comes at a strategic moment for OpenAI, which reportedly plans to launch GPT-5 in early August, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The timing suggests OpenAI is orchestrating a coordinated push to dominate the AI landscape before competitors can close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems,” said Nick Turley, OpenAI’s vice president of product for ChatGPT, in announcing the user benchmark. “Big week ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gpt-5-will-combine-reasoning-powers-into-single-ai-system"&gt;GPT-5 will combine reasoning powers into single AI system&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The upcoming model goes beyond an incremental upgrade. According to people briefed on the project who spoke to The Information, GPT-5 will integrate OpenAI’s advanced reasoning capabilities from its o3 series directly into the flagship GPT platform, creating what CEO Sam Altman has described as “a system that integrates a lot of our technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This integration marks a strategic shift for OpenAI, which has previously released reasoning models separately from its general-purpose language models. By combining these capabilities, the company aims to reduce user confusion about which model to deploy for specific tasks while creating a more powerful unified system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;turns out yes! pic.twitter.com/yVsZXKSmKR&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) August 3, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;The consolidation also serves OpenAI’s broader ambition to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI — a milestone that would trigger significant changes to its partnership with Microsoft. Under their current agreement, achieving AGI would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI’s revenue and future models, potentially reshaping one of the most consequential partnerships in technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Altman has tempered expectations, however, stating that GPT-5 won’t reach “gold level of capability for many months” after launch, suggesting the AGI threshold remains beyond immediate reach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-customers-jump-to-5-million-as-revenue-hits-13-billion"&gt;Business customers jump to 5 million as revenue hits $13 billion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The user growth reflects ChatGPT’s expanding role in corporate America. OpenAI now serves 5 million paying business customers, up from 3 million in June, as enterprises increasingly integrate AI tools into core operations. Daily user messages have surpassed 3 billion, reflecting not just growth in users but intensifying engagement with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This surge in business adoption has driven OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue to $13 billion, up from $10 billion in June, with projections suggesting it could exceed $20 billion by year-end. The revenue growth, combined with a recent $8.3 billion funding round that valued OpenAI at $300 billion, provides the financial foundation for the massive infrastructure investments required to maintain its technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those investments are substantial. OpenAI has committed to a $30 billion annual lease with Oracle for data center capacity and struck an $11.9 billion deal with cloud provider CoreWeave, while planning international expansion through partnerships like Stargate Norway and a major data center project in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth comes as OpenAI faces mounting pressure from well-funded rivals eager to capture market share. Google’s AI search product, AI Overviews, claims 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries, while its Gemini App reports 450 million monthly active users. Anthropic, backed by significant investments from Amazon and others, is reportedly seeking to raise up to $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meta has made significant strides with its Llama models, while Elon Musk’s xAI continues to attract attention and investment. The competitive landscape has intensified the AI arms race, with companies pouring billions into compute infrastructure and talent acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The competition has triggered a talent war among tech giants. Microsoft has reportedly hired more than 20 employees from Google’s DeepMind team in recent months, including former Gemini engineering head Amar Subramanya, The Information reported, as companies raid each other’s AI talent pools.&lt;/p&gt;

This focus on responsible deployment could prove crucial as regulatory scrutiny intensifies and public debate about AI’s societal effects continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When GPT-5 launches, it will include multiple variants — including mini and nano versions available through OpenAI’s API — providing developers and enterprises with options tailored to different use cases and computational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-700-million-users-signal-ai-s-mainstream-business-adoption"&gt;700 million users signal AI’s mainstream business adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The convergence of ChatGPT’s user growth and GPT-5’s launch marks a pivotal moment for the AI industry. OpenAI’s ability to maintain its lead while competitors rapidly advance will likely determine the sector’s trajectory for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s success has already reshaped how businesses think about AI integration, moving the technology from experimental projects to core operational tools. The 700 million user figure shows this transformation is accelerating, with implications extending far beyond technology into education, creative industries, and knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprise customers, the user growth provides confidence in ChatGPT’s stability and longevity — crucial factors for organizations making long-term AI investments. The platform’s scale also creates network effects, as widespread adoption drives improvements in model training and capability development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI now faces a test that will define the company’s future: whether it can convert unprecedented user growth into sustained market dominance. In a field where yesterday’s breakthrough becomes tomorrow’s baseline, 700 million users might just be the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT will reach 700 million weekly active users this week, the company announced Monday, cementing its position as one of the fastest-adopted software products in history just as the company prepares to release its most powerful language model yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge is a 40 percent jump from the 500 million weekly users ChatGPT had at the end of March and marks a fourfold increase from the same period last year. The explosive growth rivals the adoption rates of platforms like Zoom during the pandemic and early social media networks, underscoring how quickly AI tools have moved from experimental to essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The milestone comes at a strategic moment for OpenAI, which reportedly plans to launch GPT-5 in early August, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The timing suggests OpenAI is orchestrating a coordinated push to dominate the AI landscape before competitors can close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems,” said Nick Turley, OpenAI’s vice president of product for ChatGPT, in announcing the user benchmark. “Big week ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gpt-5-will-combine-reasoning-powers-into-single-ai-system"&gt;GPT-5 will combine reasoning powers into single AI system&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The upcoming model goes beyond an incremental upgrade. According to people briefed on the project who spoke to The Information, GPT-5 will integrate OpenAI’s advanced reasoning capabilities from its o3 series directly into the flagship GPT platform, creating what CEO Sam Altman has described as “a system that integrates a lot of our technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This integration marks a strategic shift for OpenAI, which has previously released reasoning models separately from its general-purpose language models. By combining these capabilities, the company aims to reduce user confusion about which model to deploy for specific tasks while creating a more powerful unified system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;turns out yes! pic.twitter.com/yVsZXKSmKR&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) August 3, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;The consolidation also serves OpenAI’s broader ambition to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI — a milestone that would trigger significant changes to its partnership with Microsoft. Under their current agreement, achieving AGI would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI’s revenue and future models, potentially reshaping one of the most consequential partnerships in technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Altman has tempered expectations, however, stating that GPT-5 won’t reach “gold level of capability for many months” after launch, suggesting the AGI threshold remains beyond immediate reach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-customers-jump-to-5-million-as-revenue-hits-13-billion"&gt;Business customers jump to 5 million as revenue hits $13 billion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The user growth reflects ChatGPT’s expanding role in corporate America. OpenAI now serves 5 million paying business customers, up from 3 million in June, as enterprises increasingly integrate AI tools into core operations. Daily user messages have surpassed 3 billion, reflecting not just growth in users but intensifying engagement with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This surge in business adoption has driven OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue to $13 billion, up from $10 billion in June, with projections suggesting it could exceed $20 billion by year-end. The revenue growth, combined with a recent $8.3 billion funding round that valued OpenAI at $300 billion, provides the financial foundation for the massive infrastructure investments required to maintain its technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those investments are substantial. OpenAI has committed to a $30 billion annual lease with Oracle for data center capacity and struck an $11.9 billion deal with cloud provider CoreWeave, while planning international expansion through partnerships like Stargate Norway and a major data center project in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth comes as OpenAI faces mounting pressure from well-funded rivals eager to capture market share. Google’s AI search product, AI Overviews, claims 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries, while its Gemini App reports 450 million monthly active users. Anthropic, backed by significant investments from Amazon and others, is reportedly seeking to raise up to $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
