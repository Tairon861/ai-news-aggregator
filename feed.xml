          &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence companies don't need permission from authors to train their large language models (LLMs) on legally acquired books, US District Judge William Alsup ruled Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind ruling that condones AI training as fair use will likely be viewed as a big win for AI companies, but it also notably put on notice all the AI companies that expect the same reasoning will apply to training on pirated copies of books—a question that remains unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the specific case that Alsup is weighing—which pits book authors against Anthropic—Alsup found that "the purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative" and "necessary" to build world-class AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this case differs from other lawsuits where authors allege that AI models risk copying and distributing their work. Because authors suing Anthropic did not allege that any of Anthropic's outputs reproduced their works or expressive style, Alsup found there was no threat that Anthropic's text generator, Claude, might replace authors in their markets. And that lacking argument did tip the fair use analysis in favor of Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic’s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them—but to turn a hard corner and create something different," Alsup wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup's ruling surely disappointed authors, who instead argued that Claude's reliance on their texts could generate competing summaries or alternative versions of their stories.

&lt;p&gt;Alsup noted that authors would be able to raise new claims if they found evidence of infringing Claude outputs. That could change the fair use calculus, as it might in a case where a judge recently suggested that Meta's AI products might be "obliterating" authors' markets for works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Authors concede that training LLMs did not result in any exact copies nor even infringing knockoffs of their works being provided to the public," Alsup wrote. "If that were not so, this would be a different case. Authors remain free to bring that case in the future should such facts develop."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anthropic must face trial over book piracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is "pleased" with the ruling, issuing a statement applauding the court for recognizing "that using ‘works to train LLMs was transformative—spectacularly so.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Anthropic is not off the hook, granted summary judgment on AI training as fair use, but is still facing a trial over piracy that Alsup ruled did not favor a fair use finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Anthropic case, the AI company is accused of downloading 7 million pirated books to build a research library where copies would be kept "forever" regardless of whether they were ever used for AI training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly realizing piracy may trigger legal challenges, Anthropic had later tried to replace pirated books with legally purchased copies. But the company also argued that even the initial copying of these pirated books was an "intermediary" step necessary to advance the transformative use of training AI. And perhaps at its least persuasive, Anthropic also argued that because it could have borrowed the books it stole, the theft alone shouldn't "short-circuit" the fair use analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alsup was not swayed by those arguments, noting that copying books from a pirate site is copyright infringement, "full stop." He rejected "Anthropic’s assumption that the use of the copies for a central library can be excused as fair use merely because some will eventually be used to train LLMs," and he cast doubt on whether any of the other AI lawsuits debating piracy could ever escape without paying damages.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"This order doubts that any accused infringer could ever meet its burden of explaining why downloading source copies from pirate sites that it could have purchased or otherwise accessed lawfully was itself reasonably necessary to any subsequent fair use," Alsup wrote. "Such piracy of otherwise available copies is inherently, irredeemably infringing even if the pirated copies are immediately used for the transformative use and immediately discarded."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alsup said that the Anthropic case may not even need to decide on that, since Anthropic's retention of pirated books for its research library alone was not transformative. Alsup wrote that Anthropic's argument to hold onto potential AI training material it pirated in case it ever decided to use it for AI training was an attempt to "fast glide over thin ice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally Alsup pointed out that Anthropic's early attempts to get permission to train on authors' works withered, as internal messages revealed the company concluded that stealing books was considered the more cost-effective path to innovation "to avoid 'legal/practice/business slog,' as cofounder and chief executive officer Dario Amodei put it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anthropic is wrong to suppose that so long as you create an exciting end product, every 'back-end step, invisible to the public,' is excused," Alsup wrote. "Here, piracy was the point: To build a central library that one could have paid for, just as Anthropic later did, but without paying for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid maximum damages in the event of a loss, Anthropic will likely continue arguing that replacing pirated books with purchased books should water down authors' fight, Alsup's order suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the Internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft, but it may affect the extent of statutory damages," Alsup noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This order doubts that any accused infringer could ever meet its burden of explaining why downloading source copies from pirate sites that it could have purchased or otherwise accessed lawfully was itself reasonably necessary to any subsequent fair use," Alsup wrote. "Such piracy of otherwise available copies is inherently, irredeemably infringing even if the pirated copies are immediately used for the transformative use and immediately discarded."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alsup said that the Anthropic case may not even need to decide on that, since Anthropic's retention of pirated books for its research library alone was not transformative. Alsup wrote that Anthropic's argument to hold onto potential AI training material it pirated in case it ever decided to use it for AI training was an attempt to "fast glide over thin ice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally Alsup pointed out that Anthropic's early attempts to get permission to train on authors' works withered, as internal messages revealed the company concluded that stealing books was considered the more cost-effective path to innovation "to avoid 'legal/practice/business slog,' as cofounder and chief executive officer Dario Amodei put it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anthropic is wrong to suppose that so long as you create an exciting end product, every 'back-end step, invisible to the public,' is excused," Alsup wrote. "Here, piracy was the point: To build a central library that one could have paid for, just as Anthropic later did, but without paying for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid maximum damages in the event of a loss, Anthropic will likely continue arguing that replacing pirated books with purchased books should water down authors' fight, Alsup's order suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the Internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft, but it may affect the extent of statutory damages," Alsup noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises may be concerned about the impact of AI applications when put into production, but hampering these projects with guardrails at the onset could slow innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning AI and one of the most prominent figures in AI development, emphasized the importance of observability and guardrails in AI development during a fireside chat at VB Transform today. However, he added that these should not come at the cost of innovation and growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ng suggested that enterprises build within sandboxes to prototype projects quickly, find the pilots that work, and start investing in observability and guardrails for these applications after they have proven to work.&amp;nbsp;This may seem counterintuitive to enterprises looking to implement AI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;See all our Transform 2025 coverage here&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“There is an important role for observability, safety and guardrails,” Ng said. “I frankly tend to put those in later because I find that one of the ways that large businesses grind to a halt is that for engineers to try anything, they have to get sign off by five vice presidents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that big businesses “can’t afford to have some random innovation team ship something that damages the brand or has sensitive information,” but this can also hamper innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, Ng said sandboxes offer a way for developer teams to “iterate really quickly with limited private information.” The sandboxes allow the organization to invest only in projects that work and then add the technology to make them responsible, including observability tools and guardrails.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for enterprises to establish innovation sandboxes, particularly for AI agents. Sandboxes allow for innovation within the confines of the enterprises without touching any sensitive information they don’t want to be public. Yet, they also allow teams to be as creative as they can to test out ideas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observability is rapidly becoming a key topic as many AI applications and agents enter production. Salesforce recently updated its agent library, Agentforce 3, to provide enhanced visibility into agent performance and further support for interoperability standards, such as MCP.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speed-and-lower-pilot-costs"&gt;Speed and lower pilot costs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Ng, speed and innovation go hand in hand, and enterprises shouldn’t be afraid of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Imagine that we’ve been on a roller coaster, but this is a slow-moving roller coaster. What’s happened in the last year, our roller coaster just picked up a lot of speed, and this is really exciting because it’s moving forward,” Ng said. “I feel like the world is now on a very fast-moving roller coaster, and it’s great.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ng said one factor that’s contributed to this speed is the tools now available for developers to work and ideate quickly, pointing out that coding agents like Windsurf and GitHub Copilot have cut down development time “of projects that used to take me three months and six engineers.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These coding agent platforms and other tools that help developers move faster have also meant the cost of doing pilot projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t feel like the cost of a proof of concept going so low that I’m fine to do a lot of POCs (proofs of concept) is bad,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-barrier"&gt;A barrier&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One barrier, though, may be finding the talent. Ng acknowledged that there are AI companies recruiting foundation model engineers with salary ranges of up to $10 million, but the price isn’t that high for software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges for many businesses is talent,” he said. “The good news for companies looking for engineers able to build applications, the price is nowhere near the $5 million range,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem, though, is that there is still not enough talent out there who are experienced in building AI projects for enterprises. So, Ng goes back to his first solution: Let them experiment in sandboxes and gain that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

The particles, which could prevent many side effects of chemotherapy by targeting tumors directly, have proved effective in mouse studies. Now the researchers have come up with a technique that allows them to manufacture many more particles in much less time, moving them closer to human use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of promise with the nanoparticle systems we’ve been developing, and we’ve been really excited more recently with the successes that we’ve been seeing in animal models for our treatments for ovarian cancer in particular,” says Hammond, the senior author of a paper on the new technique along with Darrell Irvine, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the original production technique, layers with different properties can be laid down by alternately exposing a particle to positively and negatively charged polymers, with extensive purification to remove excess polymer after each application. Each layer can carry therapeutics as well as molecules that help the particles find and enter cancer cells.

The particles, which could prevent many side effects of chemotherapy by targeting tumors directly, have proved effective in mouse studies. Now the researchers have come up with a technique that allows them to manufacture many more particles in much less time, moving them closer to human use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of promise with the nanoparticle systems we’ve been developing, and we’ve been really excited more recently with the successes that we’ve been seeing in animal models for our treatments for ovarian cancer in particular,” says Hammond, the senior author of a paper on the new technique along with Darrell Irvine, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the original production technique, layers with different properties can be laid down by alternately exposing a particle to positively and negatively charged polymers, with extensive purification to remove excess polymer after each application. Each layer can carry therapeutics as well as molecules that help the particles find and enter cancer cells. But the process is time-consuming and would be difficult to scale up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the new work, the researchers used a microfluidic mixing device that allows them to sequentially add layers as the particles flow through a microchannel.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;-&lt;/strong&gt;Work with firms big and small to help them adopt new approaches for increased productivity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; -&lt;/strong&gt;Design high-quality, human-centered jobs that bring new life to communities across the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; -&lt;/strong&gt;Re-elevate manufacturing in MIT’s own curriculum—and provide pathways for people outside MIT to gain the skills to transform their own prospects and fuel a “new manufacturing” economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; -&lt;/strong&gt;Reimagine manufacturing technologies and systems to advance fields like energy production, health care, computing, transportation, consumer products, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; -&lt;/strong&gt;Tackle such challenges as making supply chains more resilient and informing public policy to foster a broad, healthy manufacturing ecosystem that can drive decades of innovation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If all this sounds ambitious—it is. And these are just the highlights! But I’m convinced that there is no more important work we can do right now to meet the moment and serve the nation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1117720/an-intelligent-path-to-reindustrialization/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What if computer history were a romantic comedy?

The play centers on four women who conduct research on behalf of the fictional International Broadcasting Company. Early in the first act, a young engineer named Richard Sumner arrives in the offices of the research department without explaining who he is or why he is studying the behavior of the workers. Bunny Watson, the head of the department, discovers that the engineer plans to install an “electronic brain” called Emmarac, which Sumner affectionately refers to as “Emmy” and describes as “the machine that takes the pause quotient out of the work–man-hour relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What Sumner calls the “pause quotient” is jargon for the everyday activities and mundane interactions that make human beings less efficient than machines. Emmarac would eliminate inefficiencies, such as walking to a bookshelf or talking with a coworker about weekend plans. Bunny Watson comes to believe that the computing machine will eliminate not only inefficiencies in the workplace but also the need for human workers in her department. Sumner, the engineer, presents the computer as a technology of efficiency, but Watson, the department head, views it as a technology of displacement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bunny Watson’s view was not uncommon during the first decade of computing technology. Thomas Watson Sr., president of IBM, insisted that one of his firm’s first machines be called a “calculator” instead of a “computer” because “he was concerned that the latter term, which had always referred to a human being, would raise the specter of technological unemployment,” according to historians Martin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray. In keeping with the worry of both Watsons, the computer takes the stage on Broadway as a threat to white-collar work. The women in Marchant’s play fight against the threat of unemployment as soon as they learn why Sumner has arrived. The play thus attests to the fact that the very benefits of speed, accuracy, and information processing that made the computer useful for business also caused it to be perceived as a threat to the professional-managerial class.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comedy provides a template for managing the incongruity of an “electronic brain” arriving in a space oriented around human expertise and professional judgment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This threat was somewhat offset by the fact that for most of the 1950s, the computing industry was not profitable in the United States. Manufacturers produced and sold or leased the machines at steep losses, primarily to preserve a speculative market position and to bolster their image as technologically innovative. For many such firms, neglecting to compete in the emerging market for computers would have risked the perception that they were falling behind. They hoped computing would eventually become profitable as the technology improved, but even by the middle of the decade, it was not obvious to industry insiders when this would be the case. Even if the computer seemed to promise a new world of “lightning speed” efficiency and information management, committing resources to this promise was almost prohibitively costly.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;While firms weighed the financial costs of computing, the growing interest in this new technology was initially perceived by white-collar workers as a threat to the nature of managerial expertise. Large corporations dominated American enterprise after the Second World War, and what historian Alfred Chandler called the “visible hand” of managerial professionals exerted considerable influence over the economy. Many observers wondered if computing machines would lead to a “revolution” in professional-managerial tasks. Some even speculated that “electronic brains” would soon coordinate the economy, thus replacing the bureaucratic oversight of most forms of labor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Howard Gammon, an official with the US Bureau of the Budget, explained in a 1954 essay that “electronic information processing machines” could “make substantial savings and render better service” if managers were to accept the technology. Gammon advocated for the automation of office work in areas like “stock control, handling orders, processing mailing lists, or a hundred and one other activities requiring the accumulating and sorting of information.” He even anticipated the development of tools for “erect[ing] a consistent system of decisions in areas where ‘judgment’ can be reduced to sets of clear-cut rules such as (1) ‘purchase at the lowest price,’ or (2) ‘never let the supply of bolts fall below the estimated one-week requirement for any size or type.’”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Gammon’s essay illustrates how many administrative thinkers hoped that computers would allow upper-level managers to oversee industrial production through a series of unambiguous rules that would no longer require midlevel workers for their enactment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This fantasy was impossible in the 1950s for so many reasons, the most obvious being that only a limited number of executable processes in postwar managerial capitalism could be automated through extant technology, and even fewer areas of “judgment,” as Gammon called them, can be reduced to sets of clear-cut rules. Still, this fantasy was part of the cultural milieu when Marchant’s play premiered on Broadway, one year after Gammon’s report and just a few months after IBM had announced the advance in memory storage technology behind its new 705 Model II, the first successful commercial data-processing machine. IBM received 100 orders for the 705, a commercial viability that seemed to signal the beginning of a new age in American corporate life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It soon became clear, however, that this new age was not the one that Gammon imagined. Rather than causing widespread unemployment or the total automation of the visible hand, the computer would transform the character of work itself. Marchant’s play certainly invokes the possibility of unemployment, but its posture toward the computer shifts toward a more accommodative view of what later scholars would call the “computerization of work.” For example, early in the play, Richard Sumner conjures the specter of the machine as a threat when he asks Bunny Watson if the new electronic brains “give you the feeling that maybe—just maybe—that people are a little bit outmoded.” Similarly, at the beginning of the second act, a researcher named Peg remarks, “I understand thousands of people are being thrown out of work because of these electronic brains.” The play seems to affirm Sumner’s sentiment and Peg’s implicit worry about her own unemployment once the computer, Emmarac, has been installed in the third act. After the installation, Sumner and Watson give the machine a research problem that previously took Peg several days to complete. Watson expects the task to stump Emmarac, but the machine takes only a few seconds to produce the same answer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While such moments conjure the specter of “technological unemployment,” the play juxtaposes Emmarac’s feats with Watson’s wit and spontaneity. For instance, after Sumner suggests people may be “outmoded,” Watson responds, “Yes, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if they stopped making them.” Sumner gets the joke but doesn’t find it funny: “Miss Watson, Emmarac is not a subject for levity.” The staging of the play contradicts Sumner’s assertion. Emmarac occasions all manner of levity in &lt;em&gt;The Desk Set&lt;/em&gt;, ranging from Watson’s joke to Emmarac’s absurd firing of every member of the International Broadcasting Company, including its president, later in the play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This shifting portrayal of Emmarac follows a much older pattern in dramatic comedy. As literary critic Northrop Frye explains, many forms of comedy follow an “argument” in which a “new world” appears on the stage and transforms the society entrenched at the beginning of the play. The movement away from established society hinges on a “principle of conversion” that “include[s] as many people as possible in its final society: the blocking characters are more often reconciled or converted than simply repudiated.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We see a similar dynamic in how Marchant’s play portrays the efficiency expert as brusque, rational, and incapable of empathy or romantic interests. After his arrival in the office, a researcher named Sadel says, “You notice he never takes his coat off? Do you think maybe he’s a robot?” Another researcher, Ruthie Saylor, later kisses Sumner on the cheek and invites him to a party. He says, “Sorry, I’ve got work to do,” to which Ruthie responds, “Sadel’s right—you &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;a robot!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even as Sumner’s robotic behavior portrays him as antisocial, Emmarac further isolates him from the office by posing a threat to the workers. The play accentuates this blocking function by assigning Emmarac a personality and gender: Sumner calls the machine “Emmy,” and its operator, a woman named Miss Warriner, describes the machine as a “good girl.” By taking its place in the office, Emmarac effectively moves into the same space of labor and economic power as Bunny Watson, who had previously overseen the researchers and their activities. After being installed in the office, the large mainframe computer begins to coordinate this knowledge work. The gendering of the computer thus presents Emmarac as a newer model of the so-called New Woman, as if the computer imperils the feminist ideal that Bunny Watson clearly embodies. By directly challenging Watson’s socioeconomic independence and professional identity, the computer’s arrival in the workplace threatens to make the New Woman obsolete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet much like Frye’s claims about the “argument” of comedy, the conflict between Emmarac and Watson resolves as the machine transforms from a direct competitor into a collaborator. We see this shift during a final competition between Emmarac and the research department. The women have been notified that their positions have been terminated, and they begin packing up their belongings. Two requests for information suddenly arrive, but Watson and her fellow researchers refuse to process them because of their dismissal, so Warriner and Sumner attempt to field the requests. The research tasks are complicated, and Warriner mistakenly directs Emmarac to print a long, irrelevant answer. The machine inflexibly continues although the other inquiry needs to be addressed. Sumner and Warriner try to stop the machine, but this countermanding order causes the machine’s “magnetic circuit” to emit smoke and a loud noise. Sumner yells at Warriner, who runs offstage, and the efficiency expert is now the only one to field the requests and salvage the machine. However, he doesn’t know how to stop Emmarac from malfunctioning. Marchant’s stage directions here say that Watson, who has studied the machine’s maintenance and operation, “&lt;em&gt;takes a hairpin from her hair and manipulates a knob on Emmarac—the NOISE obligingly stops.&lt;/em&gt;” Watson then explains, “You forget, I know something about one of these. All that research, remember?”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The madcap quality of this scene continues after Sumner discovers that Emmarac’s “little sister” in the payroll office has sent pink slips to every employee at the broadcasting firm. Sumner then receives a letter containing his own pink slip, which prompts Watson to quote Horatio’s lament as Hamlet dies: “Good night, sweet prince.” The turn of events poses as tragedy, but of course it leads to the play’s comic resolution. Once Sumner discovers that the payroll computer has erred—or, at least, that someone improperly programmed it—he explains that the women in the research department haven’t been fired. Emmarac, he says, “was not meant to replace you. It was never intended to take over. It was installed to free your time for research—to do the daily mechanical routine.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even as Watson “fixes” the machine, the play fixes the robotic man through his professional failures. After this moment of discovery, Sumner apologizes to Watson and reconciles with the other women in the research department. He then promises to take them out to lunch and buy them “three martinis each.” Sumner exits with the women “laughing and talking,” thus reversing the antisocial role that he has occupied for most of the play.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Emmarac’s failure, too, becomes an opportunity for its conversion. It may be that a programming error led to the company-wide pink slips, but the computer’s near-breakdown results from its rigidity. In both cases, the computer fails to navigate the world of knowledge work, thus becoming less threatening and more absurd through its flashing lights, urgent noises, and smoking console. This shift in the machine’s stage presence—the fact that it &lt;em&gt;becomes comic&lt;/em&gt;—does not lead to its banishment or dismantling. Rather, after Watson “fixes” Emmarac, she uses it to compute a final inquiry submitted to her office: “What is the total weight of the Earth?” Given a problem that a human researcher “can spend months finding out,” she chooses to collaborate. Watson types out the question and Emmarac emits “its boop-boop-a-doop noise” in response, prompting her to answer, “Boop-boop-a-doop to &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;” Emmarac is no longer Watson’s automated replacement but her partner in knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Marchant’s play, comedy provides a template for managing the incongruity of an “electronic brain” arriving in a space oriented around human expertise and professional judgment. This template converts the automation of professional-­managerial tasks from a threat into an opportunity, implying that a partnership with knowledge workers can convert the electronic brain into a machine compatible with their happiness. The computerization of work thus becomes its own kind of comic plot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947 gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core/columns_5"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118022" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/book.mangrum.jpg?w=1333" width="1333" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The computer first appeared on the Broadway stage in 1955 in a romantic comedy—William Marchant’s &lt;em&gt;The Desk Set&lt;/em&gt;.

Watson types out the question and Emmarac emits “its boop-boop-a-doop noise” in response, prompting her to answer, “Boop-boop-a-doop to &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;” Emmarac is no longer Watson’s automated replacement but her partner in knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Marchant’s play, comedy provides a template for managing the incongruity of an “electronic brain” arriving in a space oriented around human expertise and professional judgment. This template converts the automation of professional-­managerial tasks from a threat into an opportunity, implying that a partnership with knowledge workers can convert the electronic brain into a machine compatible with their happiness. The computerization of work thus becomes its own kind of comic plot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947 gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core/columns_5"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118022" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/book.mangrum.jpg?w=1333" width="1333" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1117710/what-if-computer-history-were-a-romantic-comedy/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Travels with Rambax (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1117703/travels-with-rambax/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;KAOLACK, Senegal – The MIT students have just finished dinner and are crumpling soda cans into trash bins when they get the summons: “Grab your drums, grab your drums, grab your drums …”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is time for the tanibeer, a nighttime drum and dance party, in Kaolack, a town amid salt plains and peanut farms located 220 kilometers southeast of Dakar, Senegal’s capital. For the members of Rambax MIT, the Institute’s Senegalese drumming ensemble, the excitement is palpable as they fetch their drums and make their way up the road. Their destination is a small field on the family land of their director, Lamine Touré, who comes from a long line of griots, the musicians and oral historians of the Wolof people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118113" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC04925.jpg?w=1491" width="1491" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lamine Touré, director of Rambax MIT, leads drum practice in Grand Mbao&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Touré, a Senegalese master drummer and an MIT lecturer in world music, cofounded Rambax in 2001 with Patricia Tang, an associate professor and ethnomusicologist who specializes in West African music. It began as an extracurricular group to teach students and other members of the MIT community the art of sabar, a vibrant West African drumming and dance tradition. Today, Rambax is a credit-bearing class (21M.460) enrolling as many as 50 students a semester, and its ensemble’s performances draw audiences from MIT and the wider Boston community. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During Independent Activities Period (IAP), 16 members of the ensemble joined Touré and Tang on a two-week study tour in Senegal, the birthplace of the music that inspires Rambax. In addition to performing, the students attended drumming classes and dance workshops taught by expert Senegalese drummers, and they experienced sabar drumming within its traditional and cultural context in Dakar and Kaolack.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sabar celebration, known as a tanibeer when held at night, is a lavish display of dance music, a great neighborhood carnival.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Rambax is unique,” says Touré, whose family of prominent griot percussionists had him drumming from the age of four. Traveling to Senegal allowed the students to experience the cultural significance of the music—and Touré says their Senegalese audiences were really impressed with their playing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118122" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3252.jpg?w=1086" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Poster for the tanibeer in Kaolack, Senegal, featuring Rambax MIT.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAMBAX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A sabar celebration, also known as a tanibeer when held at night, is a lavish display of dance music: a great neighborhood carnival, jammed with lights, blaring speakers, griots, costumed dancers, drums and drums and ever more drums, and—of course—dancing.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;On the night of the Rambax tanibeer in January, the sky is clear and chilly breezes waft across the field, where throngs of people, some dressed in colorful Senegalese traditional garb, gather under fluorescent lights perched on lampposts, chatting and gesticulating while waiting to watch the performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the MIT students walk in, wearing their bright yellow, green, and red knee-length dashikis, the crowd erupts into applause.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Standing in front of his hometown audience, long dark dreadlocks spilling to his shoulders, Touré takes a microphone and introduces the ensemble in his native Wolof. He explains that his students are lovers of African music and, under his tutelage at MIT, have been learning the art of sabar. He pauses for a moment and leans in close to start conducting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then Rambax begins to play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118112" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC04910.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Local musicians join MIT students as they play their sabar drums at the Grand Mbao practice session.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The audience cheers and dances, forming a large circle in front of the musicians. Before long, women take turns at the center of the circle, matching the energetic rhythms of the drumming in the exuberant hip twists, arm swings, jumps, and impossibly high knee kicks of sabar dancing. The high-spirited drumming and dancing continue until the early hours of the morning.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The tanibeer is a chance for Touré “to show what he’s been teaching his American students and that they can really play sabar quite well,” says Tang, who serves as a faculty advisor to Rambax. “And that’s often a surprise to the Senegalese audience.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118121" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3196.jpg?w=2666" width="2666" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Senegalese drummers Sadda Sene, Mbaye Ndiaga Seck, and Pa Ali Konte load drums onto the Rambax van after drum practice.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PATRICIA TANG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118120" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3079.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Drum practice on the beach in Grand Mbao.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAMBAX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the 16 Rambax members on the Senegal trip is Autumn Geil ’21, a researcher and PhD student in the department of mechanical engineering. Initially drawn to music through choir and opera singing in high school, she had never heard of sabar drumming before discovering Rambax through a friend as an undergrad. She joined and has been a member of the ensemble, which she calls “just so incredible,” ever since.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118114" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC04943.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax MIT students Eri-ife Olayinka ’25 and Kaelyn Dunnell ’25 by the sea in Grand Mbao. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Geil, practicing sabar with custodians of the tradition in Senegal is an opportunity to “observe and learn from the drummers to improve my skills for future performances.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Baran Mensah ’24, a Ghanian master’s student in mechanical engineering who minored in music as an undergrad, also joined Rambax after a friend recommended it. He sees it as a way to tap into his African roots while at MIT but says it’s also “a gateway to learn about Senegalese art, music, and culture.” Until the tour, he notes, “I really didn’t know much about my country’s West African neighbor.”&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Coming on this trip allows us to take a step back, to learn about people and cultures, making us more effective communicators.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Autumn Geil ’21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eri-ife Olayinka ’25, a computation and cognition major who took Rambax classes for two semesters, says she finds the learning environment supportive and the cultural insights provided by Touré and Tang rewarding. “You see yourself getting better, becoming comfortable with playing in the class,” she says. After completing the classes to satisfy her art requirements, Olayinka stayed on in the drumming ensemble. “I genuinely enjoy being in Rambax—it’s such a cool thing we get to do as a group,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118117" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05202.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sabar artists Badara Faye, Mbaye Ndiaga Seck, and Pa Ali Konte take the mic at a tanibeer in Grand Mbao&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visiting Kaolack is more than an opportunity for Rambax members to glimpse the culture that gave rise to sabar. With horse-drawn wagons clip-clopping through its rugged terrain but also massive solar farms, Kaolack is a city where old meets new. Witnessing those contrasts—and getting to perform and to immerse themselves in the performances of local musicians—helps the students enhance what Geil calls the “human connection skills” that all scientists and technologists need.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s really important for people in STEM to make space for art and music,” she says. “Coming on this trip allows us to take a step back, to learn about people and cultures, making us more effective communicators of our technology.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118116" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05176.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Grad student Natalie Huang ’24 and local musician Badara Faye dance at a tanibeer in Grand Mbao.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118115" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05019.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax members watch Sengalese dancers and drummers at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118123" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3369.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Grad student Tina Chen ’24, Neha Basu ’25, Pa Ali Konte, Monique Brewster ’10, and grad student Sandra Huffman ’20, SM ’21, drum at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PATRICIA TANG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118124" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3371.jpg?w=2817" width="2817" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax MIT plays at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAMBAX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back inside Touré’s family compound, Tang invites the students to gather around so she can introduce them to Touré’s mother, Marie Sow, and his sisters and aunts. Sow showers them with good wishes and they bask in the glow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s important for Rambax members to know the history and culture of the people behind the music they practice, says Tang. “We really want the students to have this sort of cultural immersion—live in a Senegalese house like the Senegalese people do, hang out with Senegalese drummers, and really get a sense of what it’s like in Senegal.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdullahi Tsanni, SM ’23, a former &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt; fellow, is a science writer based in Dakar, Senegal, who specializes in narrative features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;KAOLACK, Senegal – The MIT students have just finished dinner and are crumpling soda cans into trash bins when they get the summons: “Grab your drums, grab your drums, grab your drums …”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is time for the tanibeer, a nighttime drum and dance party, in Kaolack, a town amid salt plains and peanut farms located 220 kilometers southeast of Dakar, Senegal’s capital.

The high-spirited drumming and dancing continue until the early hours of the morning.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The tanibeer is a chance for Touré “to show what he’s been teaching his American students and that they can really play sabar quite well,” says Tang, who serves as a faculty advisor to Rambax. “And that’s often a surprise to the Senegalese audience.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118121" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3196.jpg?w=2666" width="2666" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Senegalese drummers Sadda Sene, Mbaye Ndiaga Seck, and Pa Ali Konte load drums onto the Rambax van after drum practice.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PATRICIA TANG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1118120" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3079.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Drum practice on the beach in Grand Mbao.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAMBAX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the 16 Rambax members on the Senegal trip is Autumn Geil ’21, a researcher and PhD student in the department of mechanical engineering. Initially drawn to music through choir and opera singing in high school, she had never heard of sabar drumming before discovering Rambax through a friend as an undergrad. She joined and has been a member of the ensemble, which she calls “just so incredible,” ever since.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118114" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC04943.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax MIT students Eri-ife Olayinka ’25 and Kaelyn Dunnell ’25 by the sea in Grand Mbao. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Geil, practicing sabar with custodians of the tradition in Senegal is an opportunity to “observe and learn from the drummers to improve my skills for future performances.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Baran Mensah ’24, a Ghanian master’s student in mechanical engineering who minored in music as an undergrad, also joined Rambax after a friend recommended it. He sees it as a way to tap into his African roots while at MIT but says it’s also “a gateway to learn about Senegalese art, music, and culture.” Until the tour, he notes, “I really didn’t know much about my country’s West African neighbor.”&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Coming on this trip allows us to take a step back, to learn about people and cultures, making us more effective communicators.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Autumn Geil ’21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eri-ife Olayinka ’25, a computation and cognition major who took Rambax classes for two semesters, says she finds the learning environment supportive and the cultural insights provided by Touré and Tang rewarding. “You see yourself getting better, becoming comfortable with playing in the class,” she says. After completing the classes to satisfy her art requirements, Olayinka stayed on in the drumming ensemble. “I genuinely enjoy being in Rambax—it’s such a cool thing we get to do as a group,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118117" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05202.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sabar artists Badara Faye, Mbaye Ndiaga Seck, and Pa Ali Konte take the mic at a tanibeer in Grand Mbao&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visiting Kaolack is more than an opportunity for Rambax members to glimpse the culture that gave rise to sabar. With horse-drawn wagons clip-clopping through its rugged terrain but also massive solar farms, Kaolack is a city where old meets new. Witnessing those contrasts—and getting to perform and to immerse themselves in the performances of local musicians—helps the students enhance what Geil calls the “human connection skills” that all scientists and technologists need.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s really important for people in STEM to make space for art and music,” she says. “Coming on this trip allows us to take a step back, to learn about people and cultures, making us more effective communicators of our technology.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118116" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05176.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Grad student Natalie Huang ’24 and local musician Badara Faye dance at a tanibeer in Grand Mbao.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118115" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05019.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax members watch Sengalese dancers and drummers at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NIKO ODHIAMBO ’25&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118123" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3369.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Grad student Tina Chen ’24, Neha Basu ’25, Pa Ali Konte, Monique Brewster ’10, and grad student Sandra Huffman ’20, SM ’21, drum at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PATRICIA TANG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118124" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3371.jpg?w=2817" width="2817" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rambax MIT plays at the tanibeer in Kaolack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF RAMBAX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back inside Touré’s family compound, Tang invites the students to gather around so she can introduce them to Touré’s mother, Marie Sow, and his sisters and aunts. Sow showers them with good wishes and they bask in the glow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s important for Rambax members to know the history and culture of the people behind the music they practice, says Tang. “We really want the students to have this sort of cultural immersion—live in a Senegalese house like the Senegalese people do, hang out with Senegalese drummers, and really get a sense of what it’s like in Senegal.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdullahi Tsanni, SM ’23, a former &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt; fellow, is a science writer based in Dakar, Senegal, who specializes in narrative features.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1117703/travels-with-rambax/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>From MIT to low Earth orbit (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1117698/from-mit-to-low-earth-orbit/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone can point to the specific moment that set them on their life’s course. But for me, there’s no question: It happened in 1982, when I was a junior at MIT, in the Infinite Corridor. In those pre-internet days, it was where we got the scoop about everything that was happening on campus. One day, as I was racing to the chemistry labs, a poster caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I remember it, the poster showed a smiling woman in a flight suit, holding a helmet by her side. I recognized her immediately: Sally Ride, one of America’s first group of female astronauts. It had just been announced that she would be part of the crew for one of the upcoming space shuttle flights, making her the first American woman in space. And while she was visiting Lincoln Lab for training, she would be giving a speech and attending a reception hosted by the Association of MIT Alumnae. A woman speaker was still a novelty at MIT in those days. But a woman &lt;em&gt;astronaut&lt;/em&gt;? I knew this was one event I had to attend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118013" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/T38_Grinning_9360033848_3189fa8e51_o.jpg?w=1549" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman sits in the rear seat of a supersonic T-38 jet for pilot training as a newly minted NASA astronaut candidate in 1992. “When a chemist gets to fly a T-38, she will always be smiling,” she says.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the day of Sally Ride’s talk, I hurried into 10-250, the large lecture hall beneath the Great Dome that is the emblem of MIT. Sandy Yulke, the chair of the Association of MIT Alumnae, was already introducing Sally. Sally. Just a first name. As if she were one of us. I slid into an empty seat just a few rows back as Sandy talked about how proud she was to welcome the soon-to-be first American woman in space. And Sally was standing there, right where our professors stood every day. A woman. And an astronaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I was growing up in the 1960s and ’70s, the image I’d had of astronauts—or any kind of explorer, for that matter—could not have been further from the figure before me that day. And I’m not just talking about images I saw in the media—I had one much closer to home. My dad—James Joseph Coleman, known as JJ—was a career naval officer who ultimately led the Experimental Diving Unit. A legend among Navy divers, he had also been a project officer for the Sealab program that built the first underwater habitats, allowing men—and it was all men at the time—to live and work in the deep seas for extended periods. The spirit of exploration, the desire to understand fascinating and challenging environments, seemed normal to me. But because none of the explorers I saw looked like me, it didn’t occur to me that I could be one. My dad worked in a male-dominated world where I’m sure very few of his colleagues imagined that people like me might belong too.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By the time I got to MIT, in 1979, only six women had been selected as NASA astronauts. But seeing Sally Ride on the stage that day turned a possibility into a reality—a reality that could include &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of being larger than life, she was surprisingly real and relatable: a young, bright-eyed woman, with wavy brown hair kind of like mine, wearing a blue flight suit and black boots. She seemed a little shy, looking down at her hands as she was introduced and applauded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sally was obviously passionate about her scientific work—she was an accomplished astrophysicist—but she also had this amazing job where she flew jets, practiced spacewalking, and was part of a crew with a mission. Both scientist and adventurer, she was accomplishing something that no American woman ever had—and, in the process, opening the door for the rest of us. As I listened to her speak that day, an utterly unexpected idea popped into my head: &lt;em&gt;Maybe I—Cady Coleman—could have that job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you can see it, you can be it. Representation doesn’t fix everything, but it changes, on a visceral level, the menu of options that you feel you can reach for. No matter how many people tell us we can be whatever we want to be—and my mother told me that from the moment I was old enough to understand—some of us need more than words. Representation matters. A lot. We are enormously influenced by the signals that we get from our surroundings. What do people expect of us? What models do we have? What limitations do we internalize without knowing it? In her quiet, matter-of-fact way, Sally Ride shattered assumptions I didn’t know I’d taken on. Like so many people at MIT, I was an explorer at heart. What if I could explore in space as well as in the lab?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Becoming an astronaut&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one just becomes an astronaut. Every astronaut is something else first. At MIT, I had fallen in love with organic chemistry and was determined to become a research chemist, hoping to use science to improve people’s lives. Because I attended MIT on an ROTC scholarship, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Air Force upon graduation, but I was given permission to get my doctorate in polymer science and engineering from UMass Amherst before serving. I was then stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where I worked on new materials for airplanes and consulted on NASA’s Long Duration Exposure Facility experiment. I also set endurance and tolerance records as a volunteer test subject in the centrifuge at the aeromedical laboratory, testing new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the ideas that Sally Ride had sparked were never far from my mind, and when NASA put out a call for new astronauts in 1991, I applied—along with 2,053 others. I was among the 500 who got our references checked, and then one of about 90 invited to Houston for an intense weeklong interview and physical. In 1992, after months of suspense, I got the fateful phone call asking, “Would you still like to come and work with us at NASA?” Thrilled beyond words, I felt a kind of validation I’d never experienced before and have never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Four months later, I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center. Knowing that years of rigorous training lay ahead before I might launch into space on a mission, I couldn’t wait to dive in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That training turned out to be a wild ride. Within days of our arrival in Houston, we ASCANs (NASA-speak for astronaut candidates) headed to Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington state for land survival training. We practiced navigation skills and shelter building. Knots were tied. Food was scavenged. Worms were eaten. Tired, grubby people made hard decisions together. Rules were broken. Fun was had. And, importantly, we got to know one another. Water survival skills were next—we learned to disconnect from our parachutes, climb into a raft, and make the most of the supplies we had in case we had to eject from a jet or the space shuttle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118011" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KSC-99pp0921orig.jpg?w=1680" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman and the rest of the STS-93 crew head to Launch Pad 39-B for their second attempt at liftoff on the space shuttle Columbia. With this mission, Eileen M. Collins (front row, right) would become the first woman to serve as commander of a shuttle mission.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in Houston, we learned about each of the shuttle systems, studying the function of every switch and circuit breaker. (For perspective, the &lt;em&gt;condensed&lt;/em&gt; manual for the space shuttle is five inches thick.) The rule of thumb was that if something was important, then we probably had three, so we’d still be okay if two of them broke. We worked together in simulators (sims) to practice the normal procedures and learn how to react when the systems malfunctioned. For launch sims, even those normal procedures were an adventure, because the sim would shake, pitch, and roll just as the real shuttle could be expected to on launch day. We learned the basics of robotics, spacewalking, and rendezvous (how to dock with another spacecraft without colliding), and we spent time at the gym, often after hours, so we’d be in shape to work in heavy space suits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our training spanned everything from classes in how to use—and fix—the toilet in space to collecting meteorites in Antarctica, living in an underwater habitat, and learning to fly the T-38, an amazing high-performance acrobatic jet used to train Air Force pilots. (On our first training flight, we got to fly faster than the speed of sound.) All of this helped us develop an operational mindset—one geared to making decisions and solving problems in high-speed, high-pressure, real-risk ­situations that can’t be simulated, like the ones we might encounter in space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mission: It’s not about you, but it depends on you&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each time a crew of astronauts goes to space, we call it a mission. It’s an honor to be selected for a mission, and an acknowledgment that you bring skills thatwillmake it successful. Being part of a mission means you are part of something that’s bigger than yourself, but at the same time, the role you play is essential. It’s a strange paradox: It’s not about you, but it depends on you. On each of my missions, that sense of purpose brought us together, bridging our personal differences and disagreements and allowing us to achieve things we might never have thought possible. A crew typically spends at least a year, if not a few years, training together before the actual launch, and that shared mission connects us throughout.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In 1993, I got word that I’d been assigned to my first mission aboard the space shuttle. As a mission specialist on STS-73, I would put my background as a research scientist to use byperforming 30 experiments in microgravity. These experiments, which included growing potatoes inside a locker (just like Matt Damon in &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;), using sound to manipulate large liquid droplets, and growing protein crystals, would advance our understanding of science, medicine, and engineering and help pave the way for the International Space Station laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While training for STS-73, I got a call from an astronaut I greatly admired: Colonel Eileen Collins. One of the first female test pilots, she would become the first woman to pilot the space shuttle in 1995, when the STS-63 mission launched. Collins had invited some of her heroes—the seven surviving members of the Mercury 13—to attend the launch, and she was calling to ask me to help host them. The Mercury 13 were a group of 13 women who in the early 1960s had received personal letters from the head of life sciences at NASA asking them to be part of a privately funded program to include women as astronauts. They had accepted the challenge and undergone the same grueling physical tests required of NASA’s first astronauts. Although the women performed as well as or better than the Mercury 7 astronauts on the selection tests, which many of them had made sacrifices even to pursue, the program was abruptly shut down just days before they were scheduled to start the next phase of testing. It would be almost two decades before NASA selected its first female astronauts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Never had I felt more acutely aware of being part of that lineage of brave and boundary-breaking women than I did that day, standing among those pioneers, watching Eileen make history. I can’t know what the Mercury 13 were thinking as they watched Eileen’s launch, but I sensed that they knew how much it meant to Eileen to be carrying their legacy with her in the pilot seat of that space shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Missions and malfunctions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Acouple of years after I had added my name to the still-too-short list of women who had flown in space, Eileen called again. This time she told me that I would be joining her on her next mission, ­STS-93, scheduled to launch in July 1999. Our Mercury 13 heroes would attend that launch too, and Eileen would be making history once again, this time as NASA’s first female space shuttle commander. I would be the lead mission specialist for delivering the shuttle’s precious payload, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, to orbit. I’d also be one of the EVA (extravehicular activity) crew members, if any spacewalking repairs were needed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our mission to launch the world’s most powerful x-ray telescope would change the world of astrophysics. With eight times the resolution of its predecessors and the ability to observe sources that were fainter by a factor of more than 20, Chandra was designed to detect x-rays from exploding stars, black holes, clusters of galaxies, and other high-energy sources throughout the universe. Because cosmic x-rays are absorbed by our atmosphere, we can’t study them from Earth, so an x-ray telescope must operate from well above our atmosphere. Chandra wouldlaunch into low Earth orbit on the shuttle and then require additional propulsion to achieve its final orbit, a third of the way to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled by the idea that my team and I would be launching a telescope whose work would continue long after we were back on Earth. Preparation for launch was intense. As Chandra’s shepherd, I needed to be able to perform what we called the deploy sequence in my sleep. And I had to have a close relationship with the folks at the Chandra Mission Control, which was separate from NASA Mission Control, and make sure the two groups were working together. In a very real sense, Chandra represented the future of astrophysics—a window that promised a deeper understanding of the universe. When the moment came for the telescope to be deployed, all of this would be, quite literally, in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But first it was in the hands of the launch team at the Kennedy Space Center, whose job it was to get us off the ground and into orbit. And we almost didn’t make it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our first launch attempt was aborted eight seconds before liftoff. There we were, waiting for the solid rocket boosters to ignite and the bolts holding us to the launchpad to explode. Instead, we heard “Abort for a hydrogen leak” from Launch Control. Later it was revealed that a faulty sensor had been the issue. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For our second attempt, we were confidently told we were “one hundred percent GO for weather.” In other words, there was not even a hint of bad weather to delay us. And then there were lightning strikes at the launchpad. Really.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For our third launch attempt, under a bright moon on a cool, clear night, we strapped in and the countdown began. This time I was determined I wouldn’t take anything for granted—even in those final 30 seconds after control switched over to the shuttle’s internal computers. Even when the engines kicked in and I felt the &lt;em&gt;twang&lt;/em&gt; of the nose tipping forward and then back. Only when the solid rockets ignited did I let myself believe that we were actually heading back to space. As a seasoned second-time flyer, I kept my excitement contained, but inside I was whooping and hollering. And then, as &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; rolled to the heads-down position just seconds after liftoff, my joyful inner celebration was drowned out by an angry alert tone and Eileen’s voice on the radio:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Houston:&lt;/em&gt; Columbia &lt;em&gt;is in the roll and we have a fuel cell pH number one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, we got a response from the flight controllers in Houston:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston: We’d like AC bus sensors to OFF. We see a transient short on AC1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was incomprehensible to be hearing these words less than 30 seconds into our actual flight. An electrical short had taken out two of our six main engine controllers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My first thought: &lt;em&gt;We know how to deal with this. We did it last week in the simulator.&lt;/em&gt; But we weren’t in the simulator anymore. This was a real, no-shit emergency. After we returned to Earth we realized just how close we’d come to several actual life-or-death situations. No matter how much you train for just such a moment, you can’t really anticipate what it will mean to find yourself in one. I was relieved that it wasn’t long before I heard the steady voice of Jeff Ashby, our pilot, confirming that he had successfully flipped the bus sensor switches, reducing our exposure to the potential catastrophe of additional engine shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of the Space Shuttle taking off." class="wp-image-1119292" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KSC-99pp0956large.jpg?w=1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on July 23, 1999, for a five-day mission that would include releasing the Chandra X-ray Observatory.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were still headed to space, but with the loss of some of our backup capabilities, we were vulnerable. We carefully monitored the milestones that would tell us which options we still had. I tried not to hold my breath as the shuttle continued to climb and we listened for updates from Houston:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston: Two Engine Ben. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We could lose an engine and still safely abort the mission and make it to our transatlantic landing site in Ben Guerir, Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; Negative return. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We were too far along to perform an RTLS (return to launch site) and head back to Florida.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Then finally, the call we’d been wishing and waiting for:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; PRESS TO MECO. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We would make it to orbit and main engine cutoff even if one of our engines failed in the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, assured of a safe orbit as we hurtled through space, we could turn our attention to our mission: sending Chandra off to its new home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An electrical short is a serious problem. After our mission landed, the shuttle fleet would be grounded for months after inspections revealed multiple cases of wire chafing on the other shuttles. Some would call us lucky, but listening to the audio from our cockpit and from Mission Control, I credit the well-trained teams that worked their way patiently through multiple failures catalyzed by the short and by a separate, equally dangerous issue: a slow leak in one of our three engines used during launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our STS-93 launch would go down in the history books as the most dangerous ascent of the shuttle program that didn’t result in an accident. Even in the midst of it, my sense of mission helped anchor me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118012" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sts093-703-011large.jpg?w=1871" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Chandra X-ray Observatory was deployed from the space shuttle Columbia’s payload bay on July 23, 1999, just a few hours after the shuttle’s arrival in Earth orbit.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan in 1999 had been that Chandra would last five years. But as of this writing, Chandra is 25 and still sending valuable data back from space. Each year, on its “birthday,” the crew from STS-93 and the teams who worked on the ground connect via email, or in person for the big ones. We’ll always share a bond from that mission and its continuing legacy. And what a legacy it is. Young astronomers who were still toddlers when I pulled that deploy switch are now making discoveries based on the data it’s produced. Chandra is responsible for almost everything that we now know about black holes, and it’s still advancing our understanding of the universe by giant leaps. But these are difficult times. Sadly, budget cuts proposed in 2025 would eliminate Chandra, with no replacements planned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Suiting up and making change&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People often wonder what would possess any sane person to strap themself on top of a rocket. And by now you’re probably wondering why, after the harrowing malfunctions during the STS-93 launch, I was eager not only to return to space again but to spend six months living and working aboard the International Space Station. It comes back to mission. I don’t consider myself to be braver than most people, though I may be more optimistic than many. I take the risks associated with my job because I believe in what we’re doing together, and I trust my crew and our team to do all that’s humanly possible to keep us safe.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the odds were stacked against me in my quest to serve on the space station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The world of space exploration, like so many others, is slow to change. Long-standing inequities were still evident when I joined NASA in 1992, and many endured during my time there. But it can be difficult to know when to fight for change at the outset and when to adapt to unfair circumstances to get your foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first trained astronauts tended to be tall, athletic, and male—and the biases and assumptions that led to that preference were built into our equipment, especially our space suits. Our one-piece orange “pumpkin suits” worn for launching and landing weren’t designed for people with boobs or hips, so many of us wound up in baggy suits that made fitting a parachute harness tricky and uncomfortable. But fit issues with our 300-pound white spacewalking suits proved to be a much bigger problem, especially for the smaller-framed astronauts—including some men.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bulky EVA suits, which allow astronauts who venture outside a spacecraft to breathe and communicate while regulating our temperature and protecting us from radiation, are essentially human-shaped spaceships. But while they came in small, medium, large, and extra-large, those suits were designed for (male) astronauts of the Apollo era with no thought to how they might work for different body types. Given that ill-fitting equipment would affect performance, astronauts like me—who weren’t shaped like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and their compatriots—were often negatively prejudged before we even started training. As a result, NASA failed for years to leverage the skills of many members of the astronaut corps who physically didn’t fit an institutional template that hadn’t been redesigned for half a century.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spacewalk training was the most physically difficult thing I did as an astronaut. Training in that way-too-large space suit made it even harder, forcing me to find ways to optimize my ability to function. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118008" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/98_08195.jpg?w=1791" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As she prepares to head into the pool for EVA training, Coleman dons glove liners. Next, the bottom of her suit will be attached to the top and her gloves will be attached at the wrist ring, locked, and tested for a solid seal. Coleman qualified as a spacewalker for all of her missions, even when that required doing so in a medium suit that was much too big.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We practice spacewalking underwater in an enormous swimming pool. If the suit is too big for you—as even the small was for me—the extra volume of air inside drags you up to the surface when you’re trying to work underwater. It’s a profound physical disadvantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though the fit of the small spacewalking suit wasn’t great, I persevered and adapted, training for many years in that suit with above-average spacewalking grades. And I was chosen to serve as a spacewalker for both of my shuttle missions, should the need arise. Not long before my first mission, Tom Akers, one of the experienced spacewalkers, came up to me and said, “Cady, I can see that you have a real aptitude for spacewalking and also a head that thinks like a spacewalker.” But then he told me that to cut costs, NASA had decided not to use the small suits on the space station. “People are going to look at you and think you’re too small, but I think someone like you could learn to function inside a medium suit,” he said. “So my advice is this: If you are interested in flying on the space station, then when someone asks you what size suit you wear, you tell them a medium will be no problem.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, after my second shuttle flight, NASA announced that the small suit would be eliminated. I’ve never forgotten the wording of the rationale: “We’ve looked ahead at the manifest, and we have all of the spacewalkers that we need.” Implied was that they wouldn’t miss the smaller astronauts—not a bit.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think people might not have understood at the time what it meant to get rid of those small space suits. You could not live and work on the space station unless you were space-suit qualified. And because NASA was about to shut down the shuttle program, soon missions to the space station would be the only ones there were. NASA’s decision to eliminate the small suit effectively grounded more than a third of female astronauts. It also meant that few women would have the experience needed to serve in positions where they could have a say in important decisions about everything from prioritizing missions and choosing crews to making changes in NASA’s culture. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To me, eliminating the small space suit indicated that the organization didn’t understand the value of having teams whose members contribute a wide range of experiences and viewpoints. When team members are too much alike—in background, ways of thinking and seeing the world, and, yes, gender—the teams are often less effective at finding innovative solutions to complex problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Determined to contribute to the important scientific work being done on the space station, I had no choice but to qualify in the medium suit. But it would be a tall order because for the instructors, the gear is seldom at fault. You just need to get used to it, understand it better, or practice more. I did all three—but it wasn’t enough. So I also adapted everywhere I could, and I recruited a lot of great help. Kathy Thornton, one of the first female spacewalkers, recommended that I buy a waterskiing vest at Walmart to wear inside the suit. The space-suit team was horrified at the thought of using nonregulation materials, but it got them thinking. Together, we settled on having me wear a large girdle—left over from the Apollo guys—and stuffing it with NASA-approved foam to center me in the suit. This kept the air pockets more evenly distributed and allowed me to practice the required tasks, showing that I could work effectively in a medium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By adapting, which sometimes means staying silent, you may perpetuate a discriminatory system. But if I’d tried to speak the truth from day one, I’d never have made it to the day when I was taken seriously enough to start conversations about the importance of providing all astronauts with equipment that fits. I needed to launch those discussions from a place of strength, where I could be heard and make a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;How best to catalyze change is always a personal decision. Sometimes drawing a line in the sand is the most effective strategy. Other times, you have to master the ill-fitting equipment before you get a chance to redesign it. Qualifying in the too-large suit was my only option if I wanted to fly on the International Space Station, since every flight to the ISS needed two spacewalkers and a backup spacewalker—and there were only three seats in the space capsule. The alternative would have been waiting at least 11 years for the newer spacecraft, which would have a fourth seat. I had to play by the unfair rules in order to get to a point where I could change those rules.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With grit and a lot of support from others, I did end up qualifying in the medium suit. And in 2010, I set off for the International Space Station, serving as the lead robotics and science officer for Expedition 26/27 as I traveled 63,345,600 miles in 2,544 orbits over 159 days in space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118015" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cady-performs-Fluid-Experiment-in-space-horizontal-iss026e018762-cropped.jpg?w=2686" width="2686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman conducts the Capillary Flow Experiment on the International Space Station to study the behavior of liquids at interfaces in microgravity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/PAOLO NESPOLI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, efforts are underway to redesign NASA’s space suits to fit the full range of sizes represented in the astronaut corps. Because of the work I put in to make it possible for a wider range of people to excel as spacewalkers, NASA hung a portrait of me in the row of space-suit photos outside the women’s locker room. And I’m proud to know that my colleagues—women and men—are continuing the work of making change at NASA. Every change has been hard won. The numbers matter. The astronaut corps is now 40% women. Given that, it is harder to make decisions with the potential to leave women out. When a female NASA astronaut walks on the moon for the first time, she will do so in a redesigned space suit. I hope it fits her like a glove.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The crew of spaceship Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contributing to an important mission is a privilege. But who gets to contribute is as important to mission success as it is to the individuals who want to play a part. I can’t emphasize enough how much our incredibly complex NASA missions have benefited from the broad range of people involved. Bringing together people of different backgrounds and skills, with different ways of seeing the world and unique perspectives on opportunities and problems, is what makes space exploration possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118016" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-House-Science-Fair-NHQ201604130001-26415638785_ba47b4143e_o.jpg?w=2709" width="2709" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;At the White House Science Fair in 2016, Coleman sits with the “Supergirls” Junior FIRST Lego League Team from Girl Scout Troop 411 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as they await the arrival of President Barack Obama&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JOEL KOWSKY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing space, to me, means including more people—both in the privilege of going to space and in so many of our endeavors here on Earth. When I applied to be an astronaut, very few women had orbited our planet. Today, that number has grown to 82 of 633 human beings in total, and newer NASA astronaut classes have averaged 50% women. Spaceflight is making progress in terms of including people with a wider range of backgrounds, fields of expertise, and physical abilities. But we have a long way to go. And the same is true in countless fields—the barriers that we struggle with in space exploration seem to be ubiquitous in the working world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a planet, we’re facing enormous challenges, in areas from climate change to public health to how to sustainably power our endeavors. If there’s one thing I learned above all else from my time in space, it’s that we’re all sharing Earth. No one else is coming to solve our complex problems. And we won’t find solutions with teams of people who share too much in common. We need &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to contribute where they can, and so we need to create systems, environments, and equipment that make that possible. And we need to be sure that those making contributions are visible, so they can serve as models for future generations. Our job now is to make sure everyone gets enough support to acquire the skills that we—all of us—need to build collaborative teams and solve problems both on Earth and in space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth repeating: We’re &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;sharing Earth. Looking down from space, you see very few borders separating humans from one another. You understand—not as an abstract ideal but as a visceral, obvious reality—that we are one family sharing a precious, life-supporting home&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It’s so clear from up there that we are all the crew of “Spaceship Earth.” I believe that sharing that perspective, bringing it to life, will help more people see that our differences matter less than what binds us together, and motivate us to combine our efforts to tackle the challenges affecting all of us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her 24 years at NASA, Cady Coleman ’83, a scientist, musician, and mother of two, flew on two space shuttle missions and began her 159-day mission aboard the International Space Station the day after turning 50. Today, as a public speaker and consultant, she shares her insights on leadership and teamwork gleaned from the high-stakes world of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947 gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core/columns_13"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sharing Space cover" class="wp-image-1118009" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cadys-Book-Cover-JPG.jpg?w=1324" width="1324" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone can point to the specific moment that set them on their life’s course. But for me, there’s no question: It happened in 1982, when I was a junior at MIT, in the Infinite Corridor. In those pre-internet days, it was where we got the scoop about everything that was happening on campus. One day, as I was racing to the chemistry labs, a poster caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I remember it, the poster showed a smiling woman in a flight suit, holding a helmet by her side. I recognized her immediately: Sally Ride, one of America’s first group of female astronauts. It had just been announced that she would be part of the crew for one of the upcoming space shuttle flights, making her the first American woman in space. And while she was visiting Lincoln Lab for training, she would be giving a speech and attending a reception hosted by the Association of MIT Alumnae. A woman speaker was still a novelty at MIT in those days. But a woman &lt;em&gt;astronaut&lt;/em&gt;? I knew this was one event I had to attend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118013" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/T38_Grinning_9360033848_3189fa8e51_o.jpg?w=1549" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman sits in the rear seat of a supersonic T-38 jet for pilot training as a newly minted NASA astronaut candidate in 1992. “When a chemist gets to fly a T-38, she will always be smiling,” she says.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the day of Sally Ride’s talk, I hurried into 10-250, the large lecture hall beneath the Great Dome that is the emblem of MIT. Sandy Yulke, the chair of the Association of MIT Alumnae, was already introducing Sally. Sally. Just a first name. As if she were one of us. I slid into an empty seat just a few rows back as Sandy talked about how proud she was to welcome the soon-to-be first American woman in space. And Sally was standing there, right where our professors stood every day. A woman. And an astronaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I was growing up in the 1960s and ’70s, the image I’d had of astronauts—or any kind of explorer, for that matter—could not have been further from the figure before me that day. And I’m not just talking about images I saw in the media—I had one much closer to home. My dad—James Joseph Coleman, known as JJ—was a career naval officer who ultimately led the Experimental Diving Unit. A legend among Navy divers, he had also been a project officer for the Sealab program that built the first underwater habitats, allowing men—and it was all men at the time—to live and work in the deep seas for extended periods. The spirit of exploration, the desire to understand fascinating and challenging environments, seemed normal to me. But because none of the explorers I saw looked like me, it didn’t occur to me that I could be one. My dad worked in a male-dominated world where I’m sure very few of his colleagues imagined that people like me might belong too.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By the time I got to MIT, in 1979, only six women had been selected as NASA astronauts. But seeing Sally Ride on the stage that day turned a possibility into a reality—a reality that could include &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of being larger than life, she was surprisingly real and relatable: a young, bright-eyed woman, with wavy brown hair kind of like mine, wearing a blue flight suit and black boots. She seemed a little shy, looking down at her hands as she was introduced and applauded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sally was obviously passionate about her scientific work—she was an accomplished astrophysicist—but she also had this amazing job where she flew jets, practiced spacewalking, and was part of a crew with a mission. Both scientist and adventurer, she was accomplishing something that no American woman ever had—and, in the process, opening the door for the rest of us. As I listened to her speak that day, an utterly unexpected idea popped into my head: &lt;em&gt;Maybe I—Cady Coleman—could have that job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you can see it, you can be it. Representation doesn’t fix everything, but it changes, on a visceral level, the menu of options that you feel you can reach for. No matter how many people tell us we can be whatever we want to be—and my mother told me that from the moment I was old enough to understand—some of us need more than words. Representation matters. A lot. We are enormously influenced by the signals that we get from our surroundings. What do people expect of us? What models do we have? What limitations do we internalize without knowing it? In her quiet, matter-of-fact way, Sally Ride shattered assumptions I didn’t know I’d taken on. Like so many people at MIT, I was an explorer at heart. What if I could explore in space as well as in the lab?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Becoming an astronaut&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one just becomes an astronaut. Every astronaut is something else first. At MIT, I had fallen in love with organic chemistry and was determined to become a research chemist, hoping to use science to improve people’s lives. Because I attended MIT on an ROTC scholarship, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Air Force upon graduation, but I was given permission to get my doctorate in polymer science and engineering from UMass Amherst before serving. I was then stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where I worked on new materials for airplanes and consulted on NASA’s Long Duration Exposure Facility experiment. I also set endurance and tolerance records as a volunteer test subject in the centrifuge at the aeromedical laboratory, testing new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the ideas that Sally Ride had sparked were never far from my mind, and when NASA put out a call for new astronauts in 1991, I applied—along with 2,053 others. I was among the 500 who got our references checked, and then one of about 90 invited to Houston for an intense weeklong interview and physical. In 1992, after months of suspense, I got the fateful phone call asking, “Would you still like to come and work with us at NASA?” Thrilled beyond words, I felt a kind of validation I’d never experienced before and have never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Four months later, I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center. Knowing that years of rigorous training lay ahead before I might launch into space on a mission, I couldn’t wait to dive in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That training turned out to be a wild ride. Within days of our arrival in Houston, we ASCANs (NASA-speak for astronaut candidates) headed to Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington state for land survival training. We practiced navigation skills and shelter building. Knots were tied. Food was scavenged. Worms were eaten. Tired, grubby people made hard decisions together. Rules were broken. Fun was had. And, importantly, we got to know one another. Water survival skills were next—we learned to disconnect from our parachutes, climb into a raft, and make the most of the supplies we had in case we had to eject from a jet or the space shuttle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118011" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KSC-99pp0921orig.jpg?w=1680" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman and the rest of the STS-93 crew head to Launch Pad 39-B for their second attempt at liftoff on the space shuttle Columbia.

Collins (front row, right) would become the first woman to serve as commander of a shuttle mission.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in Houston, we learned about each of the shuttle systems, studying the function of every switch and circuit breaker. (For perspective, the &lt;em&gt;condensed&lt;/em&gt; manual for the space shuttle is five inches thick.) The rule of thumb was that if something was important, then we probably had three, so we’d still be okay if two of them broke. We worked together in simulators (sims) to practice the normal procedures and learn how to react when the systems malfunctioned. For launch sims, even those normal procedures were an adventure, because the sim would shake, pitch, and roll just as the real shuttle could be expected to on launch day. We learned the basics of robotics, spacewalking, and rendezvous (how to dock with another spacecraft without colliding), and we spent time at the gym, often after hours, so we’d be in shape to work in heavy space suits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our training spanned everything from classes in how to use—and fix—the toilet in space to collecting meteorites in Antarctica, living in an underwater habitat, and learning to fly the T-38, an amazing high-performance acrobatic jet used to train Air Force pilots. (On our first training flight, we got to fly faster than the speed of sound.) All of this helped us develop an operational mindset—one geared to making decisions and solving problems in high-speed, high-pressure, real-risk ­situations that can’t be simulated, like the ones we might encounter in space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mission: It’s not about you, but it depends on you&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each time a crew of astronauts goes to space, we call it a mission. It’s an honor to be selected for a mission, and an acknowledgment that you bring skills thatwillmake it successful. Being part of a mission means you are part of something that’s bigger than yourself, but at the same time, the role you play is essential. It’s a strange paradox: It’s not about you, but it depends on you. On each of my missions, that sense of purpose brought us together, bridging our personal differences and disagreements and allowing us to achieve things we might never have thought possible. A crew typically spends at least a year, if not a few years, training together before the actual launch, and that shared mission connects us throughout.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In 1993, I got word that I’d been assigned to my first mission aboard the space shuttle. As a mission specialist on STS-73, I would put my background as a research scientist to use byperforming 30 experiments in microgravity. These experiments, which included growing potatoes inside a locker (just like Matt Damon in &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;), using sound to manipulate large liquid droplets, and growing protein crystals, would advance our understanding of science, medicine, and engineering and help pave the way for the International Space Station laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While training for STS-73, I got a call from an astronaut I greatly admired: Colonel Eileen Collins. One of the first female test pilots, she would become the first woman to pilot the space shuttle in 1995, when the STS-63 mission launched. Collins had invited some of her heroes—the seven surviving members of the Mercury 13—to attend the launch, and she was calling to ask me to help host them. The Mercury 13 were a group of 13 women who in the early 1960s had received personal letters from the head of life sciences at NASA asking them to be part of a privately funded program to include women as astronauts. They had accepted the challenge and undergone the same grueling physical tests required of NASA’s first astronauts. Although the women performed as well as or better than the Mercury 7 astronauts on the selection tests, which many of them had made sacrifices even to pursue, the program was abruptly shut down just days before they were scheduled to start the next phase of testing. It would be almost two decades before NASA selected its first female astronauts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Never had I felt more acutely aware of being part of that lineage of brave and boundary-breaking women than I did that day, standing among those pioneers, watching Eileen make history. I can’t know what the Mercury 13 were thinking as they watched Eileen’s launch, but I sensed that they knew how much it meant to Eileen to be carrying their legacy with her in the pilot seat of that space shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Missions and malfunctions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Acouple of years after I had added my name to the still-too-short list of women who had flown in space, Eileen called again. This time she told me that I would be joining her on her next mission, ­STS-93, scheduled to launch in July 1999. Our Mercury 13 heroes would attend that launch too, and Eileen would be making history once again, this time as NASA’s first female space shuttle commander. I would be the lead mission specialist for delivering the shuttle’s precious payload, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, to orbit. I’d also be one of the EVA (extravehicular activity) crew members, if any spacewalking repairs were needed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our mission to launch the world’s most powerful x-ray telescope would change the world of astrophysics. With eight times the resolution of its predecessors and the ability to observe sources that were fainter by a factor of more than 20, Chandra was designed to detect x-rays from exploding stars, black holes, clusters of galaxies, and other high-energy sources throughout the universe. Because cosmic x-rays are absorbed by our atmosphere, we can’t study them from Earth, so an x-ray telescope must operate from well above our atmosphere. Chandra wouldlaunch into low Earth orbit on the shuttle and then require additional propulsion to achieve its final orbit, a third of the way to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled by the idea that my team and I would be launching a telescope whose work would continue long after we were back on Earth. Preparation for launch was intense. As Chandra’s shepherd, I needed to be able to perform what we called the deploy sequence in my sleep. And I had to have a close relationship with the folks at the Chandra Mission Control, which was separate from NASA Mission Control, and make sure the two groups were working together. In a very real sense, Chandra represented the future of astrophysics—a window that promised a deeper understanding of the universe. When the moment came for the telescope to be deployed, all of this would be, quite literally, in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But first it was in the hands of the launch team at the Kennedy Space Center, whose job it was to get us off the ground and into orbit. And we almost didn’t make it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our first launch attempt was aborted eight seconds before liftoff. There we were, waiting for the solid rocket boosters to ignite and the bolts holding us to the launchpad to explode. Instead, we heard “Abort for a hydrogen leak” from Launch Control. Later it was revealed that a faulty sensor had been the issue. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For our second attempt, we were confidently told we were “one hundred percent GO for weather.” In other words, there was not even a hint of bad weather to delay us. And then there were lightning strikes at the launchpad. Really.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For our third launch attempt, under a bright moon on a cool, clear night, we strapped in and the countdown began. This time I was determined I wouldn’t take anything for granted—even in those final 30 seconds after control switched over to the shuttle’s internal computers. Even when the engines kicked in and I felt the &lt;em&gt;twang&lt;/em&gt; of the nose tipping forward and then back. Only when the solid rockets ignited did I let myself believe that we were actually heading back to space. As a seasoned second-time flyer, I kept my excitement contained, but inside I was whooping and hollering. And then, as &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; rolled to the heads-down position just seconds after liftoff, my joyful inner celebration was drowned out by an angry alert tone and Eileen’s voice on the radio:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Houston:&lt;/em&gt; Columbia &lt;em&gt;is in the roll and we have a fuel cell pH number one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, we got a response from the flight controllers in Houston:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston: We’d like AC bus sensors to OFF. We see a transient short on AC1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was incomprehensible to be hearing these words less than 30 seconds into our actual flight. An electrical short had taken out two of our six main engine controllers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My first thought: &lt;em&gt;We know how to deal with this. We did it last week in the simulator.&lt;/em&gt; But we weren’t in the simulator anymore. This was a real, no-shit emergency. After we returned to Earth we realized just how close we’d come to several actual life-or-death situations. No matter how much you train for just such a moment, you can’t really anticipate what it will mean to find yourself in one. I was relieved that it wasn’t long before I heard the steady voice of Jeff Ashby, our pilot, confirming that he had successfully flipped the bus sensor switches, reducing our exposure to the potential catastrophe of additional engine shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An image of the Space Shuttle taking off." class="wp-image-1119292" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KSC-99pp0956large.jpg?w=1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on July 23, 1999, for a five-day mission that would include releasing the Chandra X-ray Observatory.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were still headed to space, but with the loss of some of our backup capabilities, we were vulnerable. We carefully monitored the milestones that would tell us which options we still had. I tried not to hold my breath as the shuttle continued to climb and we listened for updates from Houston:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston: Two Engine Ben. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We could lose an engine and still safely abort the mission and make it to our transatlantic landing site in Ben Guerir, Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; Negative return. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We were too far along to perform an RTLS (return to launch site) and head back to Florida.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Then finally, the call we’d been wishing and waiting for:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Columbia, &lt;em&gt;Houston&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; PRESS TO MECO. &lt;/em&gt;Translation: We would make it to orbit and main engine cutoff even if one of our engines failed in the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now, assured of a safe orbit as we hurtled through space, we could turn our attention to our mission: sending Chandra off to its new home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An electrical short is a serious problem. After our mission landed, the shuttle fleet would be grounded for months after inspections revealed multiple cases of wire chafing on the other shuttles. Some would call us lucky, but listening to the audio from our cockpit and from Mission Control, I credit the well-trained teams that worked their way patiently through multiple failures catalyzed by the short and by a separate, equally dangerous issue: a slow leak in one of our three engines used during launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our STS-93 launch would go down in the history books as the most dangerous ascent of the shuttle program that didn’t result in an accident. Even in the midst of it, my sense of mission helped anchor me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118012" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sts093-703-011large.jpg?w=1871" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Chandra X-ray Observatory was deployed from the space shuttle Columbia’s payload bay on July 23, 1999, just a few hours after the shuttle’s arrival in Earth orbit.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan in 1999 had been that Chandra would last five years. But as of this writing, Chandra is 25 and still sending valuable data back from space. Each year, on its “birthday,” the crew from STS-93 and the teams who worked on the ground connect via email, or in person for the big ones. We’ll always share a bond from that mission and its continuing legacy. And what a legacy it is. Young astronomers who were still toddlers when I pulled that deploy switch are now making discoveries based on the data it’s produced. Chandra is responsible for almost everything that we now know about black holes, and it’s still advancing our understanding of the universe by giant leaps. But these are difficult times. Sadly, budget cuts proposed in 2025 would eliminate Chandra, with no replacements planned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Suiting up and making change&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People often wonder what would possess any sane person to strap themself on top of a rocket. And by now you’re probably wondering why, after the harrowing malfunctions during the STS-93 launch, I was eager not only to return to space again but to spend six months living and working aboard the International Space Station. It comes back to mission. I don’t consider myself to be braver than most people, though I may be more optimistic than many. I take the risks associated with my job because I believe in what we’re doing together, and I trust my crew and our team to do all that’s humanly possible to keep us safe.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But the odds were stacked against me in my quest to serve on the space station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The world of space exploration, like so many others, is slow to change. Long-standing inequities were still evident when I joined NASA in 1992, and many endured during my time there. But it can be difficult to know when to fight for change at the outset and when to adapt to unfair circumstances to get your foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first trained astronauts tended to be tall, athletic, and male—and the biases and assumptions that led to that preference were built into our equipment, especially our space suits. Our one-piece orange “pumpkin suits” worn for launching and landing weren’t designed for people with boobs or hips, so many of us wound up in baggy suits that made fitting a parachute harness tricky and uncomfortable. But fit issues with our 300-pound white spacewalking suits proved to be a much bigger problem, especially for the smaller-framed astronauts—including some men.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bulky EVA suits, which allow astronauts who venture outside a spacecraft to breathe and communicate while regulating our temperature and protecting us from radiation, are essentially human-shaped spaceships. But while they came in small, medium, large, and extra-large, those suits were designed for (male) astronauts of the Apollo era with no thought to how they might work for different body types. Given that ill-fitting equipment would affect performance, astronauts like me—who weren’t shaped like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and their compatriots—were often negatively prejudged before we even started training. As a result, NASA failed for years to leverage the skills of many members of the astronaut corps who physically didn’t fit an institutional template that hadn’t been redesigned for half a century.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spacewalk training was the most physically difficult thing I did as an astronaut. Training in that way-too-large space suit made it even harder, forcing me to find ways to optimize my ability to function. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118008" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/98_08195.jpg?w=1791" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As she prepares to head into the pool for EVA training, Coleman dons glove liners. Next, the bottom of her suit will be attached to the top and her gloves will be attached at the wrist ring, locked, and tested for a solid seal. Coleman qualified as a spacewalker for all of her missions, even when that required doing so in a medium suit that was much too big.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We practice spacewalking underwater in an enormous swimming pool. If the suit is too big for you—as even the small was for me—the extra volume of air inside drags you up to the surface when you’re trying to work underwater. It’s a profound physical disadvantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though the fit of the small spacewalking suit wasn’t great, I persevered and adapted, training for many years in that suit with above-average spacewalking grades. And I was chosen to serve as a spacewalker for both of my shuttle missions, should the need arise. Not long before my first mission, Tom Akers, one of the experienced spacewalkers, came up to me and said, “Cady, I can see that you have a real aptitude for spacewalking and also a head that thinks like a spacewalker.” But then he told me that to cut costs, NASA had decided not to use the small suits on the space station. “People are going to look at you and think you’re too small, but I think someone like you could learn to function inside a medium suit,” he said. “So my advice is this: If you are interested in flying on the space station, then when someone asks you what size suit you wear, you tell them a medium will be no problem.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, after my second shuttle flight, NASA announced that the small suit would be eliminated. I’ve never forgotten the wording of the rationale: “We’ve looked ahead at the manifest, and we have all of the spacewalkers that we need.” Implied was that they wouldn’t miss the smaller astronauts—not a bit.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think people might not have understood at the time what it meant to get rid of those small space suits. You could not live and work on the space station unless you were space-suit qualified. And because NASA was about to shut down the shuttle program, soon missions to the space station would be the only ones there were. NASA’s decision to eliminate the small suit effectively grounded more than a third of female astronauts. It also meant that few women would have the experience needed to serve in positions where they could have a say in important decisions about everything from prioritizing missions and choosing crews to making changes in NASA’s culture. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To me, eliminating the small space suit indicated that the organization didn’t understand the value of having teams whose members contribute a wide range of experiences and viewpoints. When team members are too much alike—in background, ways of thinking and seeing the world, and, yes, gender—the teams are often less effective at finding innovative solutions to complex problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Determined to contribute to the important scientific work being done on the space station, I had no choice but to qualify in the medium suit. But it would be a tall order because for the instructors, the gear is seldom at fault. You just need to get used to it, understand it better, or practice more. I did all three—but it wasn’t enough. So I also adapted everywhere I could, and I recruited a lot of great help. Kathy Thornton, one of the first female spacewalkers, recommended that I buy a waterskiing vest at Walmart to wear inside the suit. The space-suit team was horrified at the thought of using nonregulation materials, but it got them thinking. Together, we settled on having me wear a large girdle—left over from the Apollo guys—and stuffing it with NASA-approved foam to center me in the suit. This kept the air pockets more evenly distributed and allowed me to practice the required tasks, showing that I could work effectively in a medium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By adapting, which sometimes means staying silent, you may perpetuate a discriminatory system. But if I’d tried to speak the truth from day one, I’d never have made it to the day when I was taken seriously enough to start conversations about the importance of providing all astronauts with equipment that fits. I needed to launch those discussions from a place of strength, where I could be heard and make a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;How best to catalyze change is always a personal decision. Sometimes drawing a line in the sand is the most effective strategy. Other times, you have to master the ill-fitting equipment before you get a chance to redesign it. Qualifying in the too-large suit was my only option if I wanted to fly on the International Space Station, since every flight to the ISS needed two spacewalkers and a backup spacewalker—and there were only three seats in the space capsule. The alternative would have been waiting at least 11 years for the newer spacecraft, which would have a fourth seat. I had to play by the unfair rules in order to get to a point where I could change those rules.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With grit and a lot of support from others, I did end up qualifying in the medium suit. And in 2010, I set off for the International Space Station, serving as the lead robotics and science officer for Expedition 26/27 as I traveled 63,345,600 miles in 2,544 orbits over 159 days in space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118015" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cady-performs-Fluid-Experiment-in-space-horizontal-iss026e018762-cropped.jpg?w=2686" width="2686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Coleman conducts the Capillary Flow Experiment on the International Space Station to study the behavior of liquids at interfaces in microgravity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/PAOLO NESPOLI&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, efforts are underway to redesign NASA’s space suits to fit the full range of sizes represented in the astronaut corps. Because of the work I put in to make it possible for a wider range of people to excel as spacewalkers, NASA hung a portrait of me in the row of space-suit photos outside the women’s locker room. And I’m proud to know that my colleagues—women and men—are continuing the work of making change at NASA. Every change has been hard won. The numbers matter. The astronaut corps is now 40% women. Given that, it is harder to make decisions with the potential to leave women out. When a female NASA astronaut walks on the moon for the first time, she will do so in a redesigned space suit. I hope it fits her like a glove.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The crew of spaceship Earth&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contributing to an important mission is a privilege. But who gets to contribute is as important to mission success as it is to the individuals who want to play a part. I can’t emphasize enough how much our incredibly complex NASA missions have benefited from the broad range of people involved. Bringing together people of different backgrounds and skills, with different ways of seeing the world and unique perspectives on opportunities and problems, is what makes space exploration possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1118016" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-House-Science-Fair-NHQ201604130001-26415638785_ba47b4143e_o.jpg?w=2709" width="2709" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;At the White House Science Fair in 2016, Coleman sits with the “Supergirls” Junior FIRST Lego League Team from Girl Scout Troop 411 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as they await the arrival of President Barack Obama&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;NASA/JOEL KOWSKY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing space, to me, means including more people—both in the privilege of going to space and in so many of our endeavors here on Earth. When I applied to be an astronaut, very few women had orbited our planet. Today, that number has grown to 82 of 633 human beings in total, and newer NASA astronaut classes have averaged 50% women. Spaceflight is making progress in terms of including people with a wider range of backgrounds, fields of expertise, and physical abilities. But we have a long way to go. And the same is true in countless fields—the barriers that we struggle with in space exploration seem to be ubiquitous in the working world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a planet, we’re facing enormous challenges, in areas from climate change to public health to how to sustainably power our endeavors. If there’s one thing I learned above all else from my time in space, it’s that we’re all sharing Earth. No one else is coming to solve our complex problems. And we won’t find solutions with teams of people who share too much in common. We need &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to contribute where they can, and so we need to create systems, environments, and equipment that make that possible. And we need to be sure that those making contributions are visible, so they can serve as models for future generations. Our job now is to make sure everyone gets enough support to acquire the skills that we—all of us—need to build collaborative teams and solve problems both on Earth and in space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s worth repeating: We’re &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;sharing Earth. Looking down from space, you see very few borders separating humans from one another. You understand—not as an abstract ideal but as a visceral, obvious reality—that we are one family sharing a precious, life-supporting home&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It’s so clear from up there that we are all the crew of “Spaceship Earth.” I believe that sharing that perspective, bringing it to life, will help more people see that our differences matter less than what binds us together, and motivate us to combine our efforts to tackle the challenges affecting all of us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her 24 years at NASA, Cady Coleman ’83, a scientist, musician, and mother of two, flew on two space shuttle missions and began her 159-day mission aboard the International Space Station the day after turning 50.

As foundation models compete on soft measures like user preference and “feeling the AGI,” having a good command of human emotions may be more important than hard analytic skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One sign of that focus came on Friday, when prominent open source group LAION released a suite of open source tools focused entirely on emotional intelligence. Called EmoNet, the release focuses on interpreting emotions from voice recordings or facial photography, a focus that reflects how the creators view emotional intelligence as a central challenge for the next generation of models.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The ability to accurately estimate emotions is a critical first step,” the group wrote in its announcement. “The next frontier is to enable AI systems to reason about these emotions in context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For LAION founder Christoph Schuhmann, this release is less about shifting the industry’s focus to emotional intelligence and more about helping independent developers keep up with a change that’s already happened. “This technology is already there for the big labs,” Schuhmann tells TechCrunch. “What we want is to democratize it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The shift isn’t limited to open source developers; it also shows up in public benchmarks like EQ-Bench, which aims to test AI models’ ability to understand complex emotions and social dynamics. Benchmark developer Sam Paech says OpenAI’s models have made significant progress in the last six months, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro shows indications of post-training with a specific focus on emotional intelligence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The labs all competing for chatbot arena ranks may be fueling some of this, since emotional intelligence is likely a big factor in how humans vote on preference leaderboards,” Paech says, referring to the AI model comparison platform that recently spun off as a well-funded startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Models’ new emotional intelligence capabilities have also shown up in academic research. In May, psychologists at the University of Bern found that models from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek all outperformed human beings on psychometric tests for emotional intelligence. Where humans typically answer 56% of questions correctly, the models averaged over 80%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that LLMs like ChatGPT are proficient — at least on par with, or even superior to, many humans — in socio-emotional tasks traditionally considered accessible only to humans,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a real pivot from traditional AI skills, which have focused on logical reasoning and information retrieval. But for Schuhmann, this kind of emotional savvy is every bit as transformative as analytic intelligence. “Imagine a whole world full of voice assistants like Jarvis and Samantha,” he says, referring to the digital assistants from “Iron Man” and “Her&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;” “Wouldn’t it be a pity if they weren’t emotionally intelligent?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the long term, Schuhmann envisions AI assistants that are more emotionally intelligent than humans and that use that insight to help humans live more emotionally healthy lives. These models “will cheer you up if you feel sad and need someone to talk to, but also protect you, like your own local guardian angel that is also a board-certified therapist.” As Schuhmann sees it, having a high-EQ virtual assistant “gives me an emotional intelligence superpower to monitor [my mental health] the same way I would monitor my glucose levels or my weight.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That level of emotional connection comes with real safety concerns. Unhealthy emotional attachments to AI models have become a common story in the media, sometimes ending in tragedy. A recent New York Times report found multiple users who have been lured into elaborate delusions through conversations with AI models, fueled by the models’ strong inclination to please users. One critic described the dynamic as “preying on the lonely and vulnerable for a monthly fee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If models get better at navigating human emotions, those manipulations could become more effective — but much of the issue comes down to the fundamental biases of model training. “Naively using reinforcement learning can lead to emergent manipulative behavior,” Paech says, pointing specifically to the recent sycophancy issues in OpenAI’s GPT-4o release. “If we aren’t careful about how we reward these models during training, we might expect more complex manipulative behavior from emotionally intelligent models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But he also sees emotional intelligence as a way to solve these problems. “I think emotional intelligence acts as a natural counter to harmful manipulative behavior of this sort,” Paech says. A more emotionally intelligent model will notice when a conversation is heading off the rails, but the question of when a model pushes back is a balance developers will have to strike carefully. “I think improving EI gets us in the direction of a healthy balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Schuhmann, at least, it’s no reason to slow down progress toward smarter models. “Our philosophy at LAION is to empower people by giving them more ability to solve problems,” he says. “To say, some people could get addicted to emotions and therefore we are not empowering the community, that would be pretty bad.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hearts-sounds.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Measuring AI progress has usually meant testing scientific knowledge or logical reasoning — but while the major benchmarks still focus on left-brain logic skills, there’s been a quiet push within AI companies to make models more emotionally intelligent.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Synthflow AI is just one of many companies building in this space that hopes to stand out from the pack because of its focus on being enterprise-grade and easy to set up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Berlin-based Synthflow is a no-code platform that lets enterprises build and deploy customized white-labeled voice AI customer service agents. The company, which launched in 2023, has amassed more than 1,000 customers and has handled more than 45 million calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup’s voice agents are both HIPAA and GDPR compliant and can be plugged into more than 200 integrations with other enterprise platforms, including Salesforce, Twilio, and HubSpot, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hakob Astabatsyan, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founders, Albert Astabatsyan, now CPO, and Sassun Mirzakhan-Saky, now CTO, started messing around with OpenAI’s ChatGPT API back in early 2023 to find potential ways to build no-code business applications on top of the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They started with a text-to-text AI bot and then tried to build a voice bot. When they realized how much harder voice was, they got excited about the potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We realized, oh my god, voice is really complicated, right? To actually make AI speak in real time like we do, having this 400 milliseconds latency, and handling interruptions, it turned out to be such a complicated task,” Astabatsyan said. “We fell in love with this problem, and we said, look, we’re gonna work only on voice bots from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The group formed Synthflow and spent the rest of 2023 building. They launched Synthflow’s first version of the product at the beginning of 2024 before releasing an enterprise-grade version of the tech at the end of the year. The company grew 15x last year and has seen over 90% retention from its enterprise customers, according to Astabatsyan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We process 5 million calls monthly,” he said. “Last year, it was like, I don’t know, 1 million, 2 million, and then we started growing very quickly. This is where Synthflow started really getting better and better because we had this velocity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup also recently raised a $20 million Series A round led by Accel with participation from existing investors Atlantic Labs and Singular. Astabatsyan said the company raised this recent round so that it could expand its team, boost research and development, and open its first U.S. office in an undecided location.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luca Bocchio, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch that the Accel team had been tracking Synthflow since it started developing its first product. What stood out to Bocchio was the founding team’s drive and its early push into building enterprise-friendly integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This team has [had] really strong views since the get-go about creating more depth with the technology and extensive integrations across CRMs, across tools enterprises may use to really provide enterprise-grade compliance,” Bocchio said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Regardless of the company’s traction, conversational AI seems poised to be a tough category. There are numerous other companies building in the space, including Bret Taylor’s Sierra, which has raised $285 million in VC money, and Bland AI, which has raised more than $50 million in venture funding, to name a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is moving so fast, and sometimes things happen faster than you would expect,” Astabatsyan said. “But for us, it’s very clear. We’re at this stage where, I would say, [we’re] in a post-product-market-fit era, where we know who our customers are. We have a pretty clear idea what’s our product roadmap, and where we want to be in the next three to five years.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Synthflow-AI-Team-Photo-Horizontal.jpg?resize=1200,801" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The conversational AI market has exploded since ChatGPT was released in November 2022 and is predicted to grow into a nearly $50 billion global industry by 2031, according to MarketsAndMarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades. VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.&amp;nbsp;Learn more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css","className":"is-style-wide"} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI-powered tools spread through enterprise software stacks, the rapid growth of the AI coding platform Windsurf is becoming a case study of what happens when developers adopt agentic tooling at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a session at today’s VB Transform 2025 conference, &lt;strong&gt;CEO and co-founder Varun Mohan &lt;/strong&gt;discussed how Windsurf’s integrated development environment (IDE) surpassed one million developers within four months of launch. More notably, the platform now writes over half of the code committed by its user base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation, moderated by VentureBeat CEO Matt Marshall, opened with a brief but pointed disclaimer: Mohan could not comment on OpenAI’s widely reported potential acquisition of Windsurf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue has drawn attention following a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report detailing a brewing standoff between OpenAI and Microsoft over the terms of that deal and broader tensions within their multi-billion-dollar partnership. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, OpenAI seeks to acquire Windsurf without giving Microsoft access to its intellectual property— an issue that could reshape the enterprise AI coding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that context set aside, the session focused on Windsurf’s technology, enterprise traction, and vision for agentic development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;See all our Transform 2025 coverage here&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-past-autocomplete"&gt;Moving past autocomplete&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf’s IDE is built around what the company calls a “mind-meld” loop—a shared project state between humans and AI that enables full coding flows rather than autocomplete suggestions. With this setup, agents can perform multi-file refactors, write test suites, and even launch UI changes when a pull request is initiated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mohan emphasized that coding assistance can’t stop at code generation. “Only about 20 to 30% of a developer’s time is spent writing code. The rest is debugging, reviewing, and testing. To truly assist, an AI system needs access to all those data sources,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf recently embedded a browser inside its IDE, allowing agents to test changes, read logs, and interact with live interfaces directly—much like a human engineer would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-and-control-by-design"&gt;Security and control by design&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI begins to participate in enterprise development cycles actively, Windsurf’s emphasis on built-in security has proven essential. “We use a hybrid model for enterprise deployments—none of the personalized data is stored outside the user’s tenant. Security is core, especially with features like our integrated browser agent,” said Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These capabilities have already made Windsurf a viable option for regulated industries. Its agents are deployed on massive codebases, including those at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mohan added that as AI becomes more accessible across roles, security will become a gating factor for productivity. “If everyone at a company will contribute to technology in some way, the missing piece is security. You don’t want a one-off system built by a non-technical user destroying another service,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-teams-rapid-testing"&gt;Small teams, rapid testing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internally, Windsurf organizes into lean squads of three or four engineers, each focused on testing a narrow set of product hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a belief that one-person billion-dollar companies are the future. But in reality, more people allow you to grow faster and build better products. The key is organizing into small, focused teams that test hypotheses in parallel,” Mohan explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This model has helped the company iterate quickly in a space where foundational AI models—and user needs—evolve at breakneck speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personalization-at-scale"&gt;Personalization at scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf’s biggest optimization at enterprise scale isn’t faster token generation or smaller models—it’s relevance. “At scale, the biggest optimization is personalization. Deeply understanding the codebase allows the agent to make maintainable, large-scale changes that reflect user intent,” said Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on general-purpose code generation, Windsurf’s system learns each customer’s stack’s structure, style, and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-for-future-models"&gt;Building for future models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Windsurf is designing its platform to remain adaptable as the capabilities of underlying AI models continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every step-function improvement in foundation models demands a major product rethink. As agents become more capable, our job is to build the platform to manage and orchestrate many of them effectively,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company is working on an open protocol that will allow enterprises to integrate any LLM—including on-premises models—into Windsurf’s agent framework, preserving flexibility and minimizing vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proving-and-measuring-value"&gt;Proving and measuring value&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf provides transparency into its performance with built-in analytics. “We provide transparency on ROI through metrics—like the percentage of code written by the assistant—which can be tied directly to internal engineering performance,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach allows platform teams to connect agentic productivity with business impact, helping justify further investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focused-execution-over-flash"&gt;Focused execution over flash&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, when asked how Windsurf plans to differentiate itself amid competition from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others, Mohan focused on internal velocity. “The challenge isn’t who’s more visible today, but who’s executing the right strategy fast enough. The risk is either moving too slowly or projecting too far out and missing near-term relevance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mohan also dismissed the idea that incumbents are inevitably doomed. “There’s no fundamental reason legacy companies like Salesforce can’t become AI-native. The real limiter is their speed of innovation, not their capability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether Windsurf becomes part of OpenAI’s future or continues independently, the company’s traction with enterprise customers — and its insistence on grounding AI in secure, measurable workflows — makes it a player worth watching as agentic development enters the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI-powered tools spread through enterprise software stacks, the rapid growth of the AI coding platform Windsurf is becoming a case study of what happens when developers adopt agentic tooling at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a session at today’s VB Transform 2025 conference, &lt;strong&gt;CEO and co-founder Varun Mohan &lt;/strong&gt;discussed how Windsurf’s integrated development environment (IDE) surpassed one million developers within four months of launch. More notably, the platform now writes over half of the code committed by its user base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation, moderated by VentureBeat CEO Matt Marshall, opened with a brief but pointed disclaimer: Mohan could not comment on OpenAI’s widely reported potential acquisition of Windsurf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue has drawn attention following a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report detailing a brewing standoff between OpenAI and Microsoft over the terms of that deal and broader tensions within their multi-billion-dollar partnership. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, OpenAI seeks to acquire Windsurf without giving Microsoft access to its intellectual property— an issue that could reshape the enterprise AI coding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that context set aside, the session focused on Windsurf’s technology, enterprise traction, and vision for agentic development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;See all our Transform 2025 coverage here&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-past-autocomplete"&gt;Moving past autocomplete&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf’s IDE is built around what the company calls a “mind-meld” loop—a shared project state between humans and AI that enables full coding flows rather than autocomplete suggestions. With this setup, agents can perform multi-file refactors, write test suites, and even launch UI changes when a pull request is initiated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mohan emphasized that coding assistance can’t stop at code generation. “Only about 20 to 30% of a developer’s time is spent writing code. The rest is debugging, reviewing, and testing. To truly assist, an AI system needs access to all those data sources,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf recently embedded a browser inside its IDE, allowing agents to test changes, read logs, and interact with live interfaces directly—much like a human engineer would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-and-control-by-design"&gt;Security and control by design&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI begins to participate in enterprise development cycles actively, Windsurf’s emphasis on built-in security has proven essential. “We use a hybrid model for enterprise deployments—none of the personalized data is stored outside the user’s tenant. Security is core, especially with features like our integrated browser agent,” said Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These capabilities have already made Windsurf a viable option for regulated industries. Its agents are deployed on massive codebases, including those at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mohan added that as AI becomes more accessible across roles, security will become a gating factor for productivity. “If everyone at a company will contribute to technology in some way, the missing piece is security. You don’t want a one-off system built by a non-technical user destroying another service,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-teams-rapid-testing"&gt;Small teams, rapid testing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internally, Windsurf organizes into lean squads of three or four engineers, each focused on testing a narrow set of product hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a belief that one-person billion-dollar companies are the future. But in reality, more people allow you to grow faster and build better products. The key is organizing into small, focused teams that test hypotheses in parallel,” Mohan explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This model has helped the company iterate quickly in a space where foundational AI models—and user needs—evolve at breakneck speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personalization-at-scale"&gt;Personalization at scale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windsurf’s biggest optimization at enterprise scale isn’t faster token generation or smaller models—it’s relevance. “At scale, the biggest optimization is personalization. Deeply understanding the codebase allows the agent to make maintainable, large-scale changes that reflect user intent,” said Mohan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on general-purpose code generation, Windsurf’s system learns each customer’s stack’s structure, style, and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-for-future-models"&gt;Building for future models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Windsurf is designing its platform to remain adaptable as the capabilities of underlying AI models continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every step-function improvement in foundation models demands a major product rethink. As agents become more capable, our job is to build the platform to manage and orchestrate many of them effectively,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company is working on an open protocol that will allow enterprises to integrate any LLM—including on-premises models—into Windsurf’s agent framework, preserving flexibility and minimizing vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windsurf provides transparency into its performance with built-in analytics. “We provide transparency on ROI through metrics—like the percentage of code written by the assistant—which can be tied directly to internal engineering performance,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;

A new vibe working approach that ditches rigid workflows for autonomous agents (AI News | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/whats-inside-genspark-a-new-vibe-working-approach-that-ditches-rigid-workflows-for-autonomous-agents/</link><description>&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-before" id="boilerplate_2682874"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibe coding has been all the rage in recent months as a simple way for anyone to build applications with generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what if that same easy-going, natural language approach was extended to other enterprise workflows? That’s the promise of an emerging category of agentic AI applications. At VB Transform 2025 today, one such application was on display with the Genspark Super Agent, which was originally launched earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Genspark Super Agent’s promise and approach could well extend the concept of vibe coding into vibe working. A key tenet of enabling vibe working, though, is to go with the flow and exert less control rather than more over AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vision is simple, we want to bring the Cursor experience for developers to the workspace for everyone,” Kay Zhu, CTO of Genspark, said at VB Transform. “Everyone here should be able to do vibe working… it’s not only the software engineer that can do vibe coding.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;See all our Transform 2025 coverage here&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-less-is-more-when-it-comes-to-enterprise-agentic-ai"&gt;Less is more when it comes to enterprise agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Zhu, a foundational premise for enabling a vibe working era is letting go of some rigid rules that have defined enterprise workflows for generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhu provocatively challenged enterprise AI orthodoxy, arguing that rigid workflows fundamentally limit what AI agents can accomplish for complex business tasks. During a live demonstration, he showed the system autonomously researching conference speakers, creating presentations, making phone calls and analyzing marketing data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most notably, the system placed an actual phone call to the event organizer, VentureBeat founder Matt Marshall, during the live presentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is normally the call that I don’t really want to do by myself, you know, in person. So I let the agent do it,” Zhu explained as the audience listened to his AI agent attempt to convince the moderator to move his presentation slot before Andrew Ng’s session. The call connected in real-time, with the agent autonomously crafting persuasive arguments on Zhu’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The calling feature has revealed unexpected use cases highlighting both the platform’s capabilities and users’ comfort with AI autonomy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We actually observe a lot of people are using Genspark to call… to do different kinds of things,” Zhu noted. “Some of the Japanese users are using this to call to resign from their company. You know they don’t like the company, but they don’t want to call them again. and some of the people are using call for me agents to break up with their boyfriend and girlfriend.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These real-world applications demonstrate how users are pushing AI agents beyond traditional business workflows into deeply personal territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technical-architecture-why-backtracking-is-good-for-enterprise-ai-nbsp"&gt;Technical architecture: Why backtracking is good for enterprise AI&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system accomplishes all of that without predefined workflows. The platform’s core philosophy of ‘less control, more tools’ represents a fundamental departure from traditional enterprise AI approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Workflow in our definition is the predefined steps and these kinds of steps often break on edge cases, when the user asks harder and harder questions, the workflow cannot hold,” Zhu said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genspark’s agentic engine represents a significant departure from traditional workflow-based AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform combines nine different large language models (LLMs) in a mixture-of-experts (MoE) configuration, equipped with over 80 tools and 10+ premium datasets. The system operates on a classic agent loop: plan, execute, observe and backtrack. Zhu emphasized that the power actually lives in the backtrack stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This backtracking capability allows the agent to intelligently recover from failures and find alternative approaches when unexpected situations arise, rather than failing at predefined workflow boundaries. The system uses LLM judges to evaluate every agent session and attributes rewards to each step, feeding this data back through reinforcement learning and prompt playbooks for continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical approach differs markedly from established frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI, which typically require more structured workflow definition. While these platforms excel at orchestrating predictable multi-step processes, Genspark’s architecture prioritizes autonomous problem-solving over deterministic execution paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-strategy-workflows-today-vibe-working-agents-tomorrow"&gt;Enterprise Strategy: Workflows today, vibe working agents tomorrow&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genspark’s rapid scaling, from launch to $36 million ARR in 45 days, demonstrates that autonomous agent platforms are moving beyond experimental phases into commercial viability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s ‘less control, more tools’ philosophy challenges fundamental assumptions about enterprise AI architecture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications for enterprises leading in AI adoption are clear: start architecting systems that can handle predictable workflows and autonomous problem-solving. The key is designing platforms that gracefully escalate from deterministic processes to agentic behavior when complexity demands it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises planning later AI adoption, Genspark’s success signals that vibe working is becoming a competitive differentiator. Organizations that remain locked into rigid workflow thinking may be disadvantaged as AI-native companies embrace more fluid, adaptive approaches to knowledge work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether autonomous AI agents will reshape enterprise workflows—it’s whether your organization will be ready when the 20% of complex cases becomes 80% of your AI workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would it be like to chat with health records the way one could with ChatGPT?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially posed by a medical student, this question sparked the development of ChatEHR at Stanford Health Care. Now in production, the tool accelerates chart reviews for emergency room admissions, streamlines patient transfer summaries and synthesizes information from complex medical histories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early pilot results, clinical users have experienced significantly sped-up information retrieval; notably, emergency physicians saw 40% reduced chart review time during critical handoffs, Michael A. Pfeffer, Stanford’s SVP and chief information and digital officer, said today in a fireside chat at VB Transform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This helps to decrease physician burnout while improving patient care, and builds upon decades of work medical facilities have been doing to collect and automate critical data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s such an exciting time in healthcare because we’ve been spending the last 20 years digitizing healthcare data and putting it into an electronic health record, but not really transforming it,” Pfeffer said in a chat with VB editor-in-chief Matt Marshall. “With the new large language model technologies, we’re actually starting to do that digital transformation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-chatehr-helps-reduce-pajama-time-get-back-to-real-face-to-face-interactions"&gt;How ChatEHR helps reduce ‘pajama time,’ get back to real face-to-face interactions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians spend up to 60% of their time on administrative tasks rather than direct patient care&lt;span&gt;. They often put in significant “pajama time,” sacrificing&lt;/span&gt; personal and family hours to complete administrative tasks outside of regular work hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of Pfeffer’s big goals is to streamline workflows and reduce those extra hours so clinicians and administrative staff can focus on more important work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of information comes in through online patient portals. AI now has the ability to read messages from patients and draft responses that a human can then review and approve for sending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of like a starting point,” he explained. “While it doesn’t necessarily save time, which is interesting, it does actually reduce cognitive burnout.” What’s more, he noted, the messages tend to be more patient friendly, because users can instruct the model to use certain language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving on to agents, Pfeffer said they’re a “pretty new” concept in healthcare but offer promising opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, patients with cancer diagnoses typically have a team of specialists who review their records and determine the next treatment steps. However, preparing is a lot of work; clinicians and staff have to go through a patient’s entire record, not just their EHR but imaging pathology, sometimes genomic data, and information on clinical trials that patients might be a good match for. All of these have to come together for the team to create a timeline and recommendations, Pfeffer explained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing that we can do for our patients is to make sure they have appropriate care, and it takes a multidisciplinary approach,” said Pfeffer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to build agents into ChatEHR that can generate a summary and timeline and make recommendations for clinician review. Pfeffer emphasized that it doesn’t replace, it prepares “just incredible summary recommendations in a multimodal way.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows medical teams to do now “actual patient care,” which is critical amidst a physician and nursing shortage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These technologies are going to shift the time physicians and nurses spend doing administrative tasks,” he said. And, when combined with ambient AI scribes that take over notetaking duties, medical staff are focusing more time on patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That face-to-face interaction is just priceless,” said Pfeffer. “We’re going to see AI shift more to clinician-patient interaction.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amazing-technologies-coupled-with-a-multidisciplinary-team"&gt;‘Amazing’ technologies coupled with a multidisciplinary team&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before ChatEHR, Pfeffer’s team rolled out SecureGPT to all of Stanford Medicine; the secure portal features 15 different models that anyone can tinker with. “What is really powerful about this technology is that you can really open it up to so many people to experiment,” said Pfeffer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stanford is taking a varied approach to AI development, building its own models and using a mix of secure and private off-the-shelf (such as Microsoft Azure) and open-source models where appropriate. Pfeffer explained that his team is “not completely specific” to one or the other, but rather goes with what will likely work best for a specific use case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s so many amazing kinds of technologies now that if you can piece them together in the right way, you can get solutions like what we’ve built,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another credit to Stanford is its multidisciplinary team; as opposed to a chief AI officer or AI group, Pfeffer gathered a chief data scientist, two informaticists, a chief medical information officer and a chief nursing information officer, and their CTO and CISO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We bring together informatics, data science and traditional IT, and wrap that into the architecture; what you get is this magic group that allows you to do these very complex projects,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Stanford views AI as a tool that everybody should know how to use, Pfeffer emphasized. Different teams need to understand how to use AI so that when they meet with business owners and come up with ways to solve problems, “AI is just part of how they think.”&lt;/p&gt;
