For the first time since the dot-com crash, computer science enrollment dropped. System-wide, it fell 6% last year after declining 3% in 2024, according to reporting this past week by the San Francisco Chronicle. Even as overall college enrollment climbed 2% nationally — according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The one exception is UC San Diego  — the only UC campus that added a dedicated AI major this fall.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS grads finding work out of college. But it’s more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Review reported last July, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;U.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT’s “AI and decision-making” major is now the second-largest major on campus, says the school. As reported by the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than 3,000 students in a new AI and cybersecurity college during its fall semester. The University at Buffalo last summer launched a new “AI and Society” department that offers seven new, specialized undergraduate degree programs, and it received more than 200 applicants before it swung open its doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The transition hasn’t been smooth everywhere. When I spoke with UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts in October, he described a spectrum — some faculty “leaning forward” with AI, others with “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, a former finance executive who arrived from outside academia, was pushing hard for AI integration despite faculty resistance. A week earlier, UNC had announced it would merge two schools to create an AI-focused entity — a decision that drew faculty pushback. Roberts had also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI. “No one’s going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,’” Roberts told me. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Parents are playing a role in this rocky transition, too. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed kids toward CS are now reflexively steering them toward other majors that seem more resistant to AI automation, including mechanical and electrical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the enrollment numbers suggest students are voting with their feet. According to a survey in October by the nonprofit Computing Research Association — its members include computer science and computer engineering departments from a wide range of universities — 62% of respondents reported that their computing programs saw undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. But with AI programs ballooning, it’s looking less like a tech exodus and more like a migration. The University of Southern California is launching an AI degree this coming fall; so are Columbia University, Pace University, and New Mexico State University, among many others. Students aren’t abandoning tech; they’re choosing programs focused on AI instead to land work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s too soon to say whether this recalibration is permanent or a temporary panic or a near-term solution to a longer-term challenge. But it’s certainly a wake-up call for administrators who’ve spent years wrestling with how to handle AI in the classroom. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT is ancient history at this point. The question now is whether American universities can move fast enough or whether they’ll keep arguing about what to do while students transfer to schools that already have answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-827810708.jpg?resize=1200,801" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Something strange happened at University of California campuses this fall.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ByteDance, the Chinese company that recently finalized a deal to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations (it retains a stake in the new joint venture), launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week.&amp;nbsp; According to the Wall Street Journal, the updated model is currently available to Chinese users of ByteDance’s Jianying app, and the company says it will soon be available to global users of its CapCut app.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similar to tools such as OpenAI’s Sora, Seedance allows users to create videos (currently limited to 15 seconds in length) by just entering a text prompt. And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After one X user posted a brief video showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter Rhett Reese responded, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Motion Picture Association soon issued a statement from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — condemned Seedance 2.0 as “an attack one very creator around the world,” while the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google over similar issues, it’s signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Variety reports that Paramount followed suit by sending Bytedance a cease-and-desist letter on Saturday. The letter claimed that “much of the content that the Seed Platforms produce contains vivid depictions of Paramount’s famous and iconic franchises and characters” and that this content “is often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from Paramount’s films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;

Glean is building the layer beneath the interface. (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259183688.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The battle for enterprise AI is heating up. Microsoft is bundling Copilot into Office. Google is pushing Gemini into Workspace. OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Seven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Glean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;Boston, MA&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;June 23, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That’s why Jain says he doesn’t see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our product gets better because we’re able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Second are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And third, and perhaps most important, is governance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You need to build a permissions-aware governance layer and retrieval layer that is able to bring the right information, but knowing who’s asking that question so that it filters the information based on their access rights,” Jain said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In large organizations, that layer can be the difference between piloting AI solutions and deploying them at scale. Enterprises can’t simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also critical is ensuring the models don’t hallucinate. Jain says its system verifies model outputs against source documents, generates line-by-line citations, and ensures that responses respect existing access rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question is whether that middle layer survives as platform giants push deeper into the stack. Microsoft and Google already control much of the enterprise workflow surface area, and they’re hungry for more. If Copilot or Gemini can access the same internal systems with the same permissions, does a standalone intelligence layer still matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jain argues enterprises don’t want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Investors have bought into that thesis. Glean raised a $150 million Series F in June 2025, nearly doubling its valuation to $7.2 billion. Unlike the frontier AI labs, Glean doesn’t need massive compute budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have a very healthy, fast-growing business,” Jain said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259183688.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Glean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That’s why Jain says he doesn’t see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our product gets better because we’re able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Second are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And third, and perhaps most important, is governance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You need to build a permissions-aware governance layer and retrieval layer that is able to bring the right information, but knowing who’s asking that question so that it filters the information based on their access rights,” Jain said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In large organizations, that layer can be the difference between piloting AI solutions and deploying them at scale. Enterprises can’t simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also critical is ensuring the models don’t hallucinate. Jain says its system verifies model outputs against source documents, generates line-by-line citations, and ensures that responses respect existing access rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The question is whether that middle layer survives as platform giants push deeper into the stack. Microsoft and Google already control much of the enterprise workflow surface area, and they’re hungry for more. If Copilot or Gemini can access the same internal systems with the same permissions, does a standalone intelligence layer still matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jain argues enterprises don’t want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Investors have bought into that thesis. Glean raised a $150 million Series F in June 2025, nearly doubling its valuation to $7.2 billion. Unlike the frontier AI labs, Glean doesn’t need massive compute budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have a very healthy, fast-growing business,” Jain said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
