Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Let’s explore the biggest moments from this year’s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-svedka"&gt;Svedka &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company’s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Svedka’s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;​It’s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;

		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic"&gt;Anthropic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic’s ad wasn’t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude’s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It wasn’t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI’s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn’t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year’s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ring"&gt;Ring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ring’s commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet’s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-google"&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ramp"&gt;Ramp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp’s AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp’s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin’s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rippling"&gt;Rippling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hims-amp-hers"&gt;Hims &amp;amp; Hers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Health company Hims &amp;amp; Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson’s expensive anti-aging routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wix"&gt;Wix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wix’s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace’s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.&lt;/p&gt;

More than that, I was baffled why anyone would spend time and money on something that seemed guaranteed to outrage cinephiles while offering negligible commercial value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This week, an in-depth profile by the New Yorker’s Michael Schulman provides more details about the project. If nothing else, it helps explain why the startup Fable and its founder Edward Saatchi are pursuing it: It seems to come from a genuine love of Welles and his work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;Boston, MA&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;June 23, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.” Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-3348882.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When a startup announced plans last fall to recreate lost footage from Orson Welles’ classic film “The Magnificent Ambersons” using generative AI, I was skeptical.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.” Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/08/okay-im-slightly-less-mad-about-that-magnificent-ambersons-ai-project/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 19:36:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Crypto.com places $70M bet on AI.com domain ahead of Super Bowl (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/08/crypto-com-places-70m-bet-on-ai-com-domain-ahead-of-super-bowl/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-08-at-12.27.26-PM.png?resize=1200,671" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Just in time to create a new Super Bowl ad, Crypto.com founder Kris Marszalek has made the priciest domain purchase in history, buying AI.com for $70 million, according to the Financial Times. The deal, paid entirely in cryptocurrency to an unknown seller, shatters previous records. (Broker Larry Fischer, who facilitated the sale, is presumably celebrating his good fortune.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Marszalek plans to debut the site during Sunday’s big game, offering consumers a personal AI agent for messaging, app usage, and stock trading. “If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years – [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime,” he told the FT.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The purchase rewrites the domain record books — not that crypto industry itself is known for its restraint when it comes to spending. Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner went bankrupt trying to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-08-at-12.27.26-PM.png?resize=1200,671" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Just in time to create a new Super Bowl ad, Crypto.com founder Kris Marszalek has made the priciest domain purchase in history, buying AI.com for $70 million, according to the Financial Times.
