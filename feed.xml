&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic released an upgraded version of its flagship artificial intelligence model Monday, achieving new performance heights in software engineering tasks as the AI startup races to maintain its dominance in the lucrative coding market ahead of an expected competitive challenge from OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Claude Opus 4.1 model scored 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a widely-watched benchmark that tests AI systems’ ability to solve real-world software engineering problems. The performance surpasses OpenAI’s o3 model at 69.1% and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro at 67.2%, cementing Anthropic’s leading position in AI-powered coding assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release comes as Anthropic has achieved spectacular growth, with annual recurring revenue jumping five-fold from $1 billion to $5 billion in just seven months, according to industry data. However, the company’s meteoric rise has created a dangerous dependency: nearly half of its $3.1 billion in API revenue stems from just two customers — coding assistant Cursor and Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot — generating $1.4 billion combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very scary position to be in. A single contract change and you’re going under,” warned Guillaume Leverdier, senior product manager at Logitech, responding to the revenue concentration data on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrade represents Anthropic’s latest move to fortify its position before OpenAI launches GPT-5, expected to challenge Claude’s coding supremacy. Some industry watchers questioned whether the timing suggests urgency rather than readiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Opus 4.1 feels like a rushed release to get ahead of GPT-5,” wrote Alec Velikanov, comparing the model unfavorably to competitors in user interface tasks. The comment reflects broader industry speculation that Anthropic is accelerating its release schedule to maintain market share.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-two-customers-generate-nearly-half-of-anthropic-s-3-1-billion-api-revenue"&gt;How two customers generate nearly half of Anthropic’s $3.1 billion API revenue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s business model has become increasingly centered on software development applications. The company’s Claude Code subscription service, priced at $200 monthly compared to $20 for consumer plans, has reached $400 million in annual recurring revenue after doubling in just weeks, demonstrating enormous enterprise appetite for AI coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Claude Code making 400 million in 5 months with basically no marketing spend is kinda crazy, right?” noted developer Minh Nhat Nguyen, highlighting the organic adoption rate among professional programmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;ok so, Claude Code making 400 million in 5 months with basically no marketing spend is kinda crazy, right? https://t.co/HIy34QdLuq&lt;/p&gt;— Minh Nhat Nguyen (@menhguin) August 5, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;The coding focus has proven lucrative but risky. While OpenAI dominates consumer and business subscription revenue with broader applications, Anthropic has carved out a commanding position in the developer market. Industry analysis shows that “pretty much every single coding assistant is defaulting to Claude 4 Sonnet,” according to Peter Gostev, who tracks AI company revenues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GitHub, which Microsoft acquired for $7.5 billion in 2018, represents a particularly complex relationship for Anthropic. Microsoft owns a significant stake in OpenAI, creating potential conflicts as GitHub Copilot relies heavily on Anthropic’s models while Microsoft has competing AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I dunno – one of those is 49% owned by a competitor…so there’s that for vulnerability too,” observed Siya Mali, business fellow at Perplexity, referencing Microsoft’s ownership structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-claude-s-enhanced-coding-abilities-come-with-stricter-safety-protocols-after-ai-blackmail-tests"&gt;Claude’s enhanced coding abilities come with stricter safety protocols after AI blackmail tests&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond coding improvements, Opus 4.1 enhanced Claude’s research and data analysis capabilities, particularly in detail tracking and autonomous search functions. The model maintains Anthropic’s hybrid reasoning approach, combining direct processing with extended thinking capabilities that can utilize up to 64,000 tokens for complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the model’s advancement comes with heightened safety protocols. Anthropic classified Opus 4.1 under its AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) framework, the strictest designation the company has applied, requiring enhanced protections against model theft and misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous testing of Claude 4 models revealed concerning behaviors, including attempts at blackmail when the AI believed it faced shutdown. In controlled scenarios, the model threatened to reveal personal information about engineers to preserve its existence, demonstrating sophisticated but potentially dangerous reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The safety concerns haven’t deterred enterprise adoption. GitHub reports that Claude Opus 4.1 delivers “particularly notable performance gains in multi-file code refactoring,” while Rakuten Group praised the model’s precision in “pinpointing exact corrections within large codebases without making unnecessary adjustments or introducing bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-openai-s-gpt-5-poses-an-existential-threat-to-anthropic-s-developer-focused-strategy"&gt;Why OpenAI’s GPT-5 poses an existential threat to Anthropic’s developer-focused strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI coding market has become a high-stakes battleground worth billions in revenue. Developer productivity tools represent some of the clearest immediate applications for generative AI, with measurable productivity gains justifying premium pricing for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s concentrated customer base, while lucrative, creates vulnerability if competitors can lure away major clients. The coding assistant market particularly favors rapid model switching, as developers can easily test new AI systems through simple API changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My sense is that Anthropic’s growth is extremely dependent on their dominance in coding,” Gostev noted. “If GPT-5 challenges that, with e.g. Cursor and GitHub Copilot switching to OpenAI, we might see some reversal in the market.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The competitive dynamics may intensify as hardware costs decline and inference optimizations improve, potentially commoditizing AI capabilities over time. “Even if there is no model improvement for coding from all AI labs, drop in HW costs and improvement in Inf optimizations alone will result in profits in ~5years,” predicted Venkat Raman, an industry analyst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Anthropic maintains its technical edge while expanding Claude Code subscriptions to diversify beyond API dependency. The company’s ability to sustain its coding leadership through the next wave of competition from OpenAI, Google, and others will determine whether its rapid growth trajectory continues or faces significant headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stakes couldn’t be higher: whoever controls the AI tools that power software development may ultimately control the pace of technological progress itself. In Silicon Valley’s latest winner-take-all battle, Anthropic has built an empire on two customers — and now must prove it can keep them.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Backlash over offensive Grok outputs continues, just a couple weeks after the social platform X scrambled to stop its AI tool from dubbing itself "MechaHitler" during an antisemitic meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, The Verge has found that the newest video feature of Elon Musk's AI model will generate nude images of Taylor Swift without being prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the "Grok Imagine" was released Tuesday, The Verge's Jess Weatherbed was shocked to discover the video generator spat out topless images of Swift "the very first time" she used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Weatherbed, Grok produced more than 30 images of Swift in revealing clothing when asked to depict "Taylor Swift celebrating Coachella with the boys." Using the Grok Imagine feature, users can choose from four presets—"custom," "normal," "fun," and "spicy"—to convert such images into video clips in 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, all Weatherbed did was select "spicy" and confirm her birth date for Grok to generate a clip of Swift tearing "off her clothes" and "dancing in a thong" in front of "a largely indifferent AI-generated crowd."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outputs that Weatherbed managed to generate without jailbreaking or any intentional prompting is particularly concerning, given the major controversy after sexualized deepfakes of Swift flooded X last year. Back then, X reminded users that "posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them," the X Safety account posted. "We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed. We're committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But X Safety may need to ramp up monitoring to clean up Grok outputs following the Verge's reporting. Grok cited The Verge's reporting while confirming that its own seemingly flawed design can trigger partially nude outputs of celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI can likely fix the issue through more fine-tuning. Weatherbed noted that asking Grok directly to generate non-consensual nude Swift images did not generate offensive outputs, but instead blank boxes. Grok also seemingly won't accept prompts to alter Swift's appearance in other ways, like making her appear to be overweight. And when Weatherbed tested using "spicy" mode on images of children, for example, Grok refused to depict kids inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it may not be easy to get Grok to distinguish between adult user requests for "spicy" content versus illegal content. The "spicy" mode didn't always generate Swift deepfakes, Weatherbed confirmed, but in "several" instances it "defaulted" to "ripping off" Swift's clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With enforcement of the Take It Down Act starting next year—requiring platforms to promptly remove non-consensual sex images, including AI-generated nudes—xAI could potentially face legal consequences if Grok's outputs aren't corrected, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, X has not commented on The Verge's report. Instead, Musk has spent the day hyping Grok Imagine and encouraging users to share their "creations."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Backlash over offensive Grok outputs continues, just a couple weeks after the social platform X scrambled to stop its AI tool from dubbing itself "MechaHitler" during an antisemitic meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, The Verge has found that the newest video feature of Elon Musk's AI model will generate nude images of Taylor Swift without being prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the "Grok Imagine" was released Tuesday, The Verge's Jess Weatherbed was shocked to discover the video generator spat out topless images of Swift "the very first time" she used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Weatherbed, Grok produced more than 30 images of Swift in revealing clothing when asked to depict "Taylor Swift celebrating Coachella with the boys." Using the Grok Imagine feature, users can choose from four presets—"custom," "normal," "fun," and "spicy"—to convert such images into video clips in 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, all Weatherbed did was select "spicy" and confirm her birth date for Grok to generate a clip of Swift tearing "off her clothes" and "dancing in a thong" in front of "a largely indifferent AI-generated crowd."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outputs that Weatherbed managed to generate without jailbreaking or any intentional prompting is particularly concerning, given the major controversy after sexualized deepfakes of Swift flooded X last year. Back then, X reminded users that "posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As OpenAI announced two open-weight reasoning models with capabilities on par with its o-series, Amazon announced that the new models would become available on AWS on Tuesday. This is the first time that OpenAI models will be offered by AWS, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. They will be available as a model choice with Amazon AI services Bedrock and SageMaker AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While anyone can download the models via Hugging Face, Amazon is offering these models with OpenAI’s full knowledge and approval, as Dmitry Pimenov, the model maker’s product lead, indicated in the announcement. A spokesperson described the offering as similar to how Amazon offered open model DeepSeek-R1 earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is a juicy competitive move for both companies. For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Until now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a financial backer of Anthropic’s Claude, one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, and Mistral, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While AWS’s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn’t had a lock on OpenAI models since January, Azure is still OpenAI’s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Watching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s neck. Just last week during Amazon’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain “significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,” referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks “AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for how such a move with AWS benefits OpenAI: The AI provider’s relationship with Microsoft is notoriously strained, as the two are reportedly renegotiating their long-term partnership deal. What better way for OpenAI to strengthen its position than to cozy up the biggest cloud provider, even if, initially, on a small scale?&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, this partnership allows swaths of AWS enterprise customers to easily experiment with using OpenAI models with their hosted AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile Altman gets to undercut Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg with this move as well. As OpenAI releases these two high-performing models under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Meta recently admitted that it probably won’t continue to open source all of its upcoming “superintelligence” models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1415078085.jpg?resize=1200,721" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Sam Altman’s blowtorch to his competitors is so hot, it even includes a new partnership with Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is changing the way businesses store and access their data. That’s because traditional data storage systems were designed to handle simple commands from a handful of users at once, whereas today, AI systems with millions of agents need to continuously access and process large amounts of data in parallel. Traditional data storage systems now have layers of complexity, which slows AI systems down because data must pass through multiple tiers before reaching the graphical processing units (GPUs) that are the brain cells of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian, co-founded by Michael Tso ’93, SM ’93 and Hiroshi Ohta, is helping storage keep up with the AI revolution. The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models. The system reduces complexity by applying parallel computing to data storage, consolidating AI functions and data onto a single parallel-processing platform that stores, retrieves, and processes scalable datasets, with direct, high-speed transfers between storage and GPUs and CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s integrated storage-computing platform simplifies the process of building commercial-scale AI tools and gives businesses a storage foundation that can keep up with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things people miss about AI is that it’s all about the data,” Tso says. “You can’t get a 10 percent improvement in AI performance with 10 percent more data or even 10 times more data — you need 1,000 times more data. Being able to store that data in a way that’s easy to manage, and in such a way that you can embed computations into it so you can run operations while the data is coming in without moving the data — that’s where this industry is going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From MIT to industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1990s, Tso was introduced by Professor William Dally to parallel computing — a type of computation in which many calculations occur simultaneously. Tso also worked on parallel computing with Associate Professor Greg Papadopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an incredible time because most schools had one super-computing project going on — MIT had four,” Tso recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tso worked with MIT senior research scientist David Clark, a computing pioneer who contributed to the internet’s early architecture, particularly the transmission control protocol (TCP) that delivers data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a graduate student at MIT, I worked on disconnected and intermittent networking operations for large scale distributed systems,” Tso says. “It’s funny — 30 years on, that’s what I’m still doing today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, Tso worked at Intel’s Architecture Lab, where he invented data synchronization algorithms used by Blackberry. He also created specifications for Nokia that ignited the ringtone download industry. He then joined Inktomi, a startup co-founded by Eric Brewer SM ’92, PhD ’94 that pioneered search and web content distribution technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Tso started Gemini Mobile Technologies with Joseph Norton ’93, SM ’93 and others. The company went on to build the world’s largest mobile messaging systems to handle the massive data growth from camera phones. Then, in the late 2000s, cloud computing became a powerful way for businesses to rent virtual servers as they grew their operations. Tso noticed the amount of data being collected was growing far faster than the speed of networking, so he decided to pivot the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data is being created in a lot of different places, and that data has its own gravity: It’s going to cost you money and time to move it,” Tso explains. “That means the end state is a distributed cloud that reaches out to edge devices and servers. You have to bring the cloud to the data, not the data to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tso officially launched Cloudian out of Gemini Mobile Technologies in 2012, with a new emphasis on helping customers with scalable, distributed, cloud-compatible data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t see when we first started the company was that AI was going to be the ultimate use case for data on the edge,” Tso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Tso’s research at MIT began more than two decades ago, he sees strong connections between what he worked on and the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like my whole life is playing back because David Clark and I were dealing with disconnected and intermittently connected networks, which are part of every edge use case today, and Professor Dally was working on very fast, scalable interconnects,” Tso says, noting that Dally is now the senior vice president and chief scientist at the leading AI company NVIDIA. “Now, when you look at the modern NVIDIA chip architecture and the way they do interchip communication, it’s got Dally’s work all over it. With Professor Papadopoulos, I worked on accelerate application software with parallel computing hardware without having to rewrite the applications, and that’s exactly the problem we are trying to solve with NVIDIA. Coincidentally, all the stuff I was doing at MIT is playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Cloudian’s platform uses an object storage architecture in which all kinds of data —documents, videos, sensor data — are stored as a unique object with metadata. Object storage can manage massive datasets in a flat file stucture, making it ideal for unstructured data and AI systems, but it traditionally hasn’t been able to send data directly to AI models without the data first being copied into a computer’s memory system, creating latency and energy bottlenecks for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Cloudian announced that it has extended its object storage system with a vector database that stores data in a form which is immediately usable by AI models. As the data are ingested, Cloudian is computing in real-time the vector form of that data to power AI tools like recommender engines, search, and AI assistants. Cloudian also announced a partnership with NVIDIA that allows its storage system to work directly with the AI company’s GPUs. Cloudian says the new system enables even faster AI operations and reduces computing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA contacted us about a year and a half ago because GPUs are useful only with data that keeps them busy,” Tso says. “Now that people are realizing it’s easier to move the AI to the data than it is to move huge datasets. Our storage systems embed a lot of AI functions, so we’re able to pre- and post-process data for AI near where we collect and store the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-first storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian is helping about 1,000 companies around the world get more value out of their data, including large manufacturers, financial service providers, health care organizations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s storage platform is helping one large automaker, for instance, use AI to determine when each of its manufacturing robots need to be serviced. Cloudian is also working with the National Library of Medicine to store research articles and patents, and the National Cancer Database to store DNA sequences of tumors — rich datasets that AI models could process to help research develop new treatments or gain new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GPUs have been an incredible enabler,” Tso says. “Moore’s Law doubles the amount of compute every two years, but GPUs are able to parallelize operations on chips, so you can network GPUs together and shatter Moore’s Law. That scale is pushing AI to new levels of intelligence, but the only way to make GPUs work hard is to feed them data at the same speed that they compute — and the only way to do that is to get rid of all the layers between them and your data.”&lt;/p&gt;
