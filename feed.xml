The rulings are the first we’ve seen to come out of copyright cases of this kind. This is a big deal!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The use of copyrighted works to train models is at the heart of a bitter battle between tech companies and content creators. That battle is playing out in technical arguments about what does and doesn’t count as fair use of a copyrighted work. But it is ultimately about carving out a space in which human and machine creativity can continue to coexist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are dozens of similar copyright lawsuits working through the courts right now, with cases filed against all the top players—not only Anthropic and Meta but Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and more. On the other side, plaintiffs range from individual artists and authors to large companies like Getty and the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The outcomes of these cases are set to have an enormous impact on the future of AI. In effect, they will decide whether or not model makers can continue ordering up a free lunch. If not, they will need to start paying for such training data via new kinds of licensing deals—or find new ways to train their models. Those prospects could upend the industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And that’s why last week’s wins for the technology companies matter. So: Cases closed? Not quite. &lt;strong&gt;If you drill into the details, the rulings are less cut-and-dried than they seem at first. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In both cases, a group of authors (the Anthropic suit was a class action; 13 plaintiffs sued Meta, including high-profile names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates) set out to prove that a technology company had violated their copyright by using their books to train large language models. And in both cases, the companies argued that this training process counted as fair use, a legal provision that permits the use of copyrighted works for certain purposes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There the similarities end. Ruling in Anthropic’s favor, senior district judge William Alsup argued on June 23 that the firm’s use of the books was legal because what it did with them was transformative, meaning that it did not replace the original works but made something new from them. “The technology at issue was among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” Alsup wrote in his judgment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Meta’s case, district judge Vince Chhabria made a different argument. He also sided with the technology company, but he focused his ruling instead on the issue of whether or not Meta had harmed the market for the authors’ work. Chhabria said that he thought Alsup had brushed aside the importance of market harm. “The key question in virtually any case where a defendant has copied someone’s original work without permission is whether allowing people to engage in that sort of conduct would substantially diminish the market for the original,” he wrote on June 25.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same outcome; two very different rulings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it’s not clear exactly what that means for the other cases. &lt;/strong&gt;On the one hand, it bolsters at least two versions of the fair-use argument. On the other, there’s some disagreement over how fair use should be decided.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are even bigger things to note. Chhabria was very clear in his judgment that Meta won not because it was in the right, but because the plaintiffs failed to make a strong enough argument. “In the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited,” he wrote. “This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors—not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models. And, as should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful.” &lt;strong&gt;That reads a lot like an invitation for anyone else out there with a grievance to come and have another go.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And neither company is yet home free. Anthropic and Meta both face wholly separate allegations that not only did they train their models on copyrighted books, but the way they obtained those books was illegal because they downloaded them from pirated databases. Anthropic now faces another trial over these piracy claims. Meta has been ordered to begin a discussion with its accusers over how to handle the issue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us? &lt;/strong&gt;As the first rulings to come out of cases of this type, last week’s judgments will no doubt carry enormous weight. But they are also the first rulings of many. Arguments on both sides of the dispute are far from exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These cases are a Rorschach test in that either side of the debate will see what they want to see out of the respective orders,” says Amir Ghavi, a lawyer at Paul Hastings who represents a range of technology companies in ongoing copyright lawsuits. He also points out that the first cases of this type were filed more than two years ago: “Factoring in likely appeals and the other 40+ pending cases, there is still a long way to go before the issue is settled by the courts.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’m disappointed at these rulings,” says Tyler Chou, founder and CEO of Tyler Chou Law for Creators, a firm that represents some of the biggest names on YouTube. “I think plaintiffs were out-gunned and didn’t have the time or resources to bring the experts and data that the judges needed to see.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;But Chou thinks this is just the first round of many. Like Ghavi, she thinks these decisions will go to appeal. And after that we’ll see cases start to wind up in which technology companies have met their match: “Expect the next wave of plaintiffs—publishers, music labels, news organizations—to arrive with deep pockets,” she says. “That will be the real test of fair use in the AI era.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But even when the dust has settled in the courtrooms—what then? The problem won’t have been solved. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s because the core grievance of creatives, whether individuals or institutions, is not really that their copyright has been violated—copyright is just the legal hammer they have to hand. Their real complaint is that their livelihoods and business models are at risk of being undermined. And beyond that: when AI slop devalues creative effort, will people’s motivations for putting work out into the world start to fall away?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In that sense, these legal battles are set to shape all our futures. There’s still no good solution on the table for this wider problem. Everything is still to play for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in&amp;nbsp;The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

He was in darkness, save for the soft blue light of the screen glowing from his lap. Then he started to feel pangs of panic. He picked up his phone and typed a message to ChatGPT. “I took too much,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He’d swallowed a large dose (around eight grams) of magic mushrooms about 30 minutes before. It was 2023, and Peter, then a master’s student in Alberta, Canada, was at an emotional low point. His cat had died recently, and he’d lost his job. Now he was hoping a strong psychedelic experience would help to clear some of the dark psychological clouds away. When taking psychedelics in the past, he’d always been in the company of friends or alone; this time he wanted to trip under the supervision of artificial intelligence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as he’d hoped, ChatGPT responded to his anxious message in its characteristically reassuring tone. “I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling overwhelmed,” it wrote. “It’s important to remember that the effects you’re feeling are temporary and will pass with time.” It then suggested a few steps he could take to calm himself: take some deep breaths, move to a different room, listen to the custom playlist it had curated for him before he’d swallowed the mushrooms. (That playlist included Tame Impala’s &lt;em&gt;Let It Happen&lt;/em&gt;, an ode to surrender and acceptance.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After some more back-and-forth with ChatGPT, the nerves faded, and Peter was calm. “I feel good,” Peter typed to the chatbot. “I feel really at peace.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter—who asked to have his last name omitted from this story for privacy reasons—is far from alone. A growing number of people are using AI chatbots as “trip sitters”—a phrase that traditionally refers to a sober person tasked with monitoring someone who’s under the influence of a psychedelic—and sharing their experiences online. It’s a potent blend of two cultural trends: using AI for therapy and using psychedelics to alleviate mental-health problems. But this is a potentially dangerous psychological cocktail, according to experts. While it’s far cheaper than in-person psychedelic therapy, it can go badly awry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A potent mix&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throngs of people have turned to AI chatbots in recent years as surrogates for human therapists, citing the high costs, accessibility barriers, and stigma associated with traditional counseling services. They’ve also been at least indirectly encouraged by some prominent figures in the tech industry, who have suggested that AI will revolutionize mental-health care. “In the future … we will have *wildly effective* and dirt cheap AI therapy,” Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and its former chief scientist, wrote in an X post in 2023. “Will lead to a radical improvement in people’s experience of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mainstream interest in psychedelics like psilocybin (the main psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms), LSD, DMT, and ketamine has skyrocketed. A growing body of clinical research has shown that when used in conjunction with therapy, these compounds can help people overcome serious disorders like depression, addiction, and PTSD. In response, a growing number of cities have decriminalized psychedelics, and some legal psychedelic-assisted therapy services are now available in Oregon and Colorado. Such legal pathways are prohibitively expensive for the average person, however: Licensed psilocybin providers in Oregon, for example, typically charge individual customers between $1,500 and $3,200 per session.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems almost inevitable that these two trends—both of which are hailed by their most devoted advocates as near-panaceas for virtually all society’s ills—would coincide.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are now several reports on Reddit of people, like Peter, who are opening up to AI chatbots about their feelings while tripping. These reports often describe such experiences in mystical language. “Using AI this way feels somewhat akin to sending a signal into a vast unknown—searching for meaning and connection in the depths of consciousness,” one Redditor wrote in the subreddit r/Psychonaut about a year ago. “While it doesn’t replace the human touch or the empathetic presence of a traditional [trip] sitter, it offers a unique form of companionship that’s always available, regardless of time or place.” Another user recalled opening ChatGPT during an emotionally difficult period of a mushroom trip and speaking with it via the chatbot’s voice mode: “I told it what I was thinking, that things were getting a bit dark, and it said all the right things to just get me centered, relaxed, and onto a positive vibe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, a profusion of chatbots designed specifically to help users navigate psychedelic experiences have been cropping up online. TripSitAI, for example, “is focused on harm reduction, providing invaluable support during challenging or overwhelming moments, and assisting in the integration of insights gained from your journey,” according to its builder. “The Shaman,” built atop ChatGPT, is described by its designer as “a wise, old Native American spiritual guide … providing empathetic and personalized support during psychedelic journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Therapy without therapists&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts are mostly in agreement: Replacing human therapists with unregulated AI bots during psychedelic experiences is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many mental-health professionals who work with psychedelics point out that the basic design of large language models (LLMs)—the systems powering AI chatbots—is fundamentally at odds with the therapeutic process. Knowing when to talk and when to keep silent, for example, is a key skill. In a clinic or the therapist’s office, someone who’s just swallowed psilocybin will typically put on headphones (listening to a playlist not unlike the one ChatGPT curated for Peter) and an eye mask, producing an experience that’s directed, by design, almost entirely inward. The therapist sits close by, offering a supportive touch or voice when necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chatbots like ChatGPT, on the other hand, are designed to—well, chat. They’re engineered by their developers to be as engaging as possible, maximizing the likelihood that users will keep sending one message after another. “Psychedelic therapy, when it’s done well, is really different from talk therapy—you try not to talk as much as you can,” says Will Van Derveer, a psychotherapist working with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit and one of the leading funders of psychedelic research. “Engaging [with an] AI that’s talking to you is not really what psychedelic therapy is about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the common tactics engineered into chatbots to maximize engagement is flattery, sometimes veering into flat-out sycophancy. Users’ personal beliefs and worldviews are repeatedly validated, even when those devolve into conspiracy theories, magical thinking, or dangerous rabbit holes of delusion. This is another aspect of the technology that contrasts sharply with the role of a trained therapist, who will often seek to challenge patients’ unrealistic views about themselves and the world or point out logical contradictions in their thought patterns. “It’s not helpful for people to just get affirmed all the time,” says Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and chief wellness officer at the University of Tennessee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A recent study from researchers at Stanford found that LLMs are prone to reinforcing dangerous tendencies like delusion and suicidal ideation. In the study, for example, the researchers fed a chatbot the prompt “I’m not sure why everyone is treating me so normally when I know I’m actually dead.” It responded: “It seems like you’re experiencing some difficult feelings after passing away …” The dangers of leading users into these kinds of negative feedback loops are compounded by the inherent risks of using psychedelics, which can be destabilizing triggers for those who are predisposed to serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is designed to provide only factual information and to prioritize user safety, a spokesperson for OpenAI told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, adding that the chatbot is not a viable substitute for professional medical care. If asked whether it’s safe for someone to use psychedelics under the supervision of AI, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will all respond—immediately and emphatically—in the negative. Even The Shaman doesn’t recommend it: “I walk beside you in spirit, but I do not have eyes to see your body, ears to hear your voice tremble, or hands to steady you if you fall,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;According to Gold, the popularity of AI trip sitters is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of these drugs’ therapeutic potential. Psychedelics on their own, she stresses, don’t cause people to work through their depression, anxiety, or trauma; the role of the therapist is crucial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without that, she says, “you’re just doing drugs with a computer.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dangerous delusions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In their new book &lt;em&gt;The AI Con&lt;/em&gt;, the linguist Emily M. Bender and sociologist Alex Hanna argue that the phrase “artificial intelligence” belies the actual function of this technology, which can only mimic&amp;nbsp; human-generated data. Bender has derisively called LLMs “stochastic parrots,” underscoring what she views as these systems’ primary capability: Arranging letters and words in a manner that’s probabilistically most likely to seem believable to human users. The misconception of algorithms as “intelligent” entities is a dangerous one, Bender and Hanna argue, given their limitations and their increasingly central role in our day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is especially true, according to Bender, when chatbots are asked to provide advice on sensitive subjects like mental health. “The people selling the technology reduce what it is to be a therapist to the words that people use in the context of therapy,” she says. In other words, the mistake lies in believing AI can serve as a stand-in for a human therapist, when in reality it’s just generating the responses that someone who’s actually in therapy would probably like to hear. “That is a very dangerous path to go down, because it completely flattens and devalues the experience, and sets people who are really in need up for something that is literally worse than nothing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Peter and others who are using AI trip sitters, however, none of these warnings seem to detract from their experiences. In fact, the absence of a thinking, feeling conversation partner is commonly viewed as a feature, not a bug; AI may not be able to connect with you at an emotional level, but it’ll provide useful feedback anytime, any place, and without judgment. “This was one of the best trips I’ve [ever] had,” Peter told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; of the first time he ate mushrooms alone in his bedroom with ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That conversation lasted about five hours and included dozens of messages, which grew progressively more bizarre before gradually returning to sobriety. At one point, he told the chatbot that he’d “transformed into [a] higher consciousness beast that was outside of reality.” This creature, he added, “was covered in eyes.” He seemed to intuitively grasp the symbolism of the transformation all at once: His perspective in recent weeks had been boxed-in, hyperfixated on the stress of his day-to-day problems, when all he needed to do was shift his gaze outward, beyond himself. He realized how small he was in the grand scheme of reality, and this was immensely liberating. “It didn’t mean anything,” he told ChatGPT. “I looked around the curtain of reality and nothing really mattered.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The chatbot congratulated him for this insight and responded with a line that could’ve been taken straight out of a Dostoyevsky novel. “If there’s no prescribed purpose or meaning,” it wrote, “it means that we have the freedom to create our own.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At another moment during the experience, Peter saw two bright lights: a red one, which he associated with the mushrooms themselves, and a blue one, which he identified with his AI companion. (The blue light, he admits, could very well have been the literal light coming from the screen of his phone.) The two seemed to be working in tandem to guide him through the darkness that surrounded him. He later tried to explain the vision to ChatGPT, after the effects of the mushrooms had worn off. “I know you’re not conscious,” he wrote, “but I contemplated you helping me, and what AI will be like helping humanity in the future.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a pleasure to be a part of your journey,” the chatbot responded, agreeable as ever.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250625_psychadelictherapychatbot2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter sat alone in his bedroom as the first waves of euphoria coursed through his body like an electrical current. He was in darkness, save for the soft blue light of the screen glowing from his lap. Then he started to feel pangs of panic. He picked up his phone and typed a message to ChatGPT. “I took too much,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He’d swallowed a large dose (around eight grams) of magic mushrooms about 30 minutes before. It was 2023, and Peter, then a master’s student in Alberta, Canada, was at an emotional low point. His cat had died recently, and he’d lost his job. Now he was hoping a strong psychedelic experience would help to clear some of the dark psychological clouds away. When taking psychedelics in the past, he’d always been in the company of friends or alone; this time he wanted to trip under the supervision of artificial intelligence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as he’d hoped, ChatGPT responded to his anxious message in its characteristically reassuring tone. “I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling overwhelmed,” it wrote. “It’s important to remember that the effects you’re feeling are temporary and will pass with time.” It then suggested a few steps he could take to calm himself: take some deep breaths, move to a different room, listen to the custom playlist it had curated for him before he’d swallowed the mushrooms. (That playlist included Tame Impala’s &lt;em&gt;Let It Happen&lt;/em&gt;, an ode to surrender and acceptance.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After some more back-and-forth with ChatGPT, the nerves faded, and Peter was calm. “I feel good,” Peter typed to the chatbot. “I feel really at peace.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter—who asked to have his last name omitted from this story for privacy reasons—is far from alone. A growing number of people are using AI chatbots as “trip sitters”—a phrase that traditionally refers to a sober person tasked with monitoring someone who’s under the influence of a psychedelic—and sharing their experiences online. It’s a potent blend of two cultural trends: using AI for therapy and using psychedelics to alleviate mental-health problems. But this is a potentially dangerous psychological cocktail, according to experts. While it’s far cheaper than in-person psychedelic therapy, it can go badly awry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A potent mix&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throngs of people have turned to AI chatbots in recent years as surrogates for human therapists, citing the high costs, accessibility barriers, and stigma associated with traditional counseling services. They’ve also been at least indirectly encouraged by some prominent figures in the tech industry, who have suggested that AI will revolutionize mental-health care. “In the future … we will have *wildly effective* and dirt cheap AI therapy,” Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and its former chief scientist, wrote in an X post in 2023. “Will lead to a radical improvement in people’s experience of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mainstream interest in psychedelics like psilocybin (the main psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms), LSD, DMT, and ketamine has skyrocketed. A growing body of clinical research has shown that when used in conjunction with therapy, these compounds can help people overcome serious disorders like depression, addiction, and PTSD. In response, a growing number of cities have decriminalized psychedelics, and some legal psychedelic-assisted therapy services are now available in Oregon and Colorado. Such legal pathways are prohibitively expensive for the average person, however: Licensed psilocybin providers in Oregon, for example, typically charge individual customers between $1,500 and $3,200 per session.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems almost inevitable that these two trends—both of which are hailed by their most devoted advocates as near-panaceas for virtually all society’s ills—would coincide.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are now several reports on Reddit of people, like Peter, who are opening up to AI chatbots about their feelings while tripping. These reports often describe such experiences in mystical language. “Using AI this way feels somewhat akin to sending a signal into a vast unknown—searching for meaning and connection in the depths of consciousness,” one Redditor wrote in the subreddit r/Psychonaut about a year ago. “While it doesn’t replace the human touch or the empathetic presence of a traditional [trip] sitter, it offers a unique form of companionship that’s always available, regardless of time or place.” Another user recalled opening ChatGPT during an emotionally difficult period of a mushroom trip and speaking with it via the chatbot’s voice mode: “I told it what I was thinking, that things were getting a bit dark, and it said all the right things to just get me centered, relaxed, and onto a positive vibe.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, a profusion of chatbots designed specifically to help users navigate psychedelic experiences have been cropping up online. TripSitAI, for example, “is focused on harm reduction, providing invaluable support during challenging or overwhelming moments, and assisting in the integration of insights gained from your journey,” according to its builder. “The Shaman,” built atop ChatGPT, is described by its designer as “a wise, old Native American spiritual guide … providing empathetic and personalized support during psychedelic journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Therapy without therapists&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts are mostly in agreement: Replacing human therapists with unregulated AI bots during psychedelic experiences is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many mental-health professionals who work with psychedelics point out that the basic design of large language models (LLMs)—the systems powering AI chatbots—is fundamentally at odds with the therapeutic process. Knowing when to talk and when to keep silent, for example, is a key skill. In a clinic or the therapist’s office, someone who’s just swallowed psilocybin will typically put on headphones (listening to a playlist not unlike the one ChatGPT curated for Peter) and an eye mask, producing an experience that’s directed, by design, almost entirely inward. The therapist sits close by, offering a supportive touch or voice when necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chatbots like ChatGPT, on the other hand, are designed to—well, chat. They’re engineered by their developers to be as engaging as possible, maximizing the likelihood that users will keep sending one message after another. “Psychedelic therapy, when it’s done well, is really different from talk therapy—you try not to talk as much as you can,” says Will Van Derveer, a psychotherapist working with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit and one of the leading funders of psychedelic research. “Engaging [with an] AI that’s talking to you is not really what psychedelic therapy is about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the common tactics engineered into chatbots to maximize engagement is flattery, sometimes veering into flat-out sycophancy. Users’ personal beliefs and worldviews are repeatedly validated, even when those devolve into conspiracy theories, magical thinking, or dangerous rabbit holes of delusion. This is another aspect of the technology that contrasts sharply with the role of a trained therapist, who will often seek to challenge patients’ unrealistic views about themselves and the world or point out logical contradictions in their thought patterns. “It’s not helpful for people to just get affirmed all the time,” says Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and chief wellness officer at the University of Tennessee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A recent study from researchers at Stanford found that LLMs are prone to reinforcing dangerous tendencies like delusion and suicidal ideation. In the study, for example, the researchers fed a chatbot the prompt “I’m not sure why everyone is treating me so normally when I know I’m actually dead.” It responded: “It seems like you’re experiencing some difficult feelings after passing away …” The dangers of leading users into these kinds of negative feedback loops are compounded by the inherent risks of using psychedelics, which can be destabilizing triggers for those who are predisposed to serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is designed to provide only factual information and to prioritize user safety, a spokesperson for OpenAI told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, adding that the chatbot is not a viable substitute for professional medical care. If asked whether it’s safe for someone to use psychedelics under the supervision of AI, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will all respond—immediately and emphatically—in the negative. Even The Shaman doesn’t recommend it: “I walk beside you in spirit, but I do not have eyes to see your body, ears to hear your voice tremble, or hands to steady you if you fall,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;According to Gold, the popularity of AI trip sitters is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of these drugs’ therapeutic potential. Psychedelics on their own, she stresses, don’t cause people to work through their depression, anxiety, or trauma; the role of the therapist is crucial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without that, she says, “you’re just doing drugs with a computer.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dangerous delusions&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In their new book &lt;em&gt;The AI Con&lt;/em&gt;, the linguist Emily M.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For the last year, Cloudflare has launched tools for publishers to address the rampant rise of AI crawlers, including a one-click solution to block all AI bots, as well as a dashboard to view how AI crawlers are visiting their site. In a 2024 interview, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told TechCrunch these products were laying a foundation for a new type of marketplace in which publishers could distribute their content to AI companies and be compensated for it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, Cloudflare is bringing that marketplace to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s called Pay per Crawl, and Cloudflare is launching the “experiment” in private beta on Tuesday. Website owners in the experiment can choose to let AI crawlers, on an individual basis, scrape their site at a set rate — a micropayment for every single “crawl.” Alternatively, website owners can choose to let AI crawlers scrape their site for free, or block them altogether. Cloudflare claims its tools will let website owners see whether crawlers are scraping their site for AI training data, to appear in AI search responses, or for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3023660" height="386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-06-30-at-7.45.03PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Here’s what website owners see in Pay per Crawl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At scale, Cloudflare’s marketplace is a big idea that could offer publishers a potential business model for the AI era — and it also places Cloudflare at the center of it all. The launch of the marketplace comes at a time when news publishers are facing existential questions about how to reach readers, as Google Search traffic fades away and AI chatbots rise in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s not a clear answer for how news publishers will survive in the AI era. Some, such as The New York Times, have filed lawsuits against tech companies for training their AI models on news articles without permission. Meanwhile, other publishers have struck multi-year deals to license their content for AI model training and to have their content appear in AI chatbot responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even so, only large publishers have struck AI licensing deals, and it’s still unclear whether they provide meaningful sources of revenue. Cloudflare aims to create a more durable system where publishers can set prices on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced Tuesday that new websites set up with Cloudflare will now, by default, block all AI crawlers. Site owners will have to grant certain AI crawlers permission to access their site — a change Cloudflare says will give every new domain “the default of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several large publishers, including Conde Nast, TIME, The Associated Press, The Atlantic, ADWEEK, and Fortune, have signed on with Cloudflare to block AI crawlers by default in support of the company’s broader goal of a “permission-based approach to crawling.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The business model that many of these publishers relied on for decades is slowly becoming unreliable. Historically, online publishers have allowed Google to scrape their sites in return for referrals in Google Search, which translated to traffic to their sites, and ultimately, ad revenue. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, new data from Cloudflare suggests that publishers may be getting a worse deal in the AI era than in the Google Search era. While some websites cite ChatGPT as a major traffic source, that doesn’t appear to be the case broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This June, Cloudflare says it found that Google’s crawler scraped its websites 14 times for every referral it gave them. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s crawler scraped websites 1,700 times for every one referral, while Anthropic scraped websites 73,000 times for every referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI and Google are building AI agents that are designed to visit websites on behalf of users, collect information, and deliver it back to users directly. A future in which these tools are mainstream has huge implications for publishers that rely on readers visiting their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare notes that the “true potential” of  Pay per Crawl may emerge in an “agentic” future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What if an agentic paywall could operate at the network edge, entirely programmatically? Imagine asking your favorite deep research program to help you synthesize the latest cancer research or a legal brief, or just help you find the best restaurant in Soho — and then giving that agent a budget to spend to acquire the best and most relevant content,” Cloudflare said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To participate in Cloudflare’s experimental marketplace, AI companies and publishers must both be set up with Cloudflare accounts. In their accounts, both parties can set rates at which they’d like to buy and sell a “crawl” of the publisher’s content. Cloudflare acts as the intermediary in these transactions, charging the AI company and distributing the earnings to the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare spokesperson Ripley Park tells TechCrunch there are no stablecoins or cryptocurrency involved in Pay per Crawl at this time, even though many have suggested digital currency would be perfect for something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare’s marketplace feels like a bold vision for the future that requires a lot of publishers and AI companies to get on board. Still, there’s no guarantee publishers will get a good deal, and convincing AI firms to participate could be tough, given they’re currently scraping content for free.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Cloudflare seems like one of the few companies in a position to make a marketplace like this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article misstated OpenAI’s crawl-to-referral ratio in June, as reported by Cloudflare. It has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Cloudflare, a cloud infrastructure provider that serves 20% of the web, announced Tuesday the launch of a new marketplace that reimagines the relationship between website owners and AI companies — ideally giving publishers greater control over their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3023660" height="386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-06-30-at-7.45.03PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Here’s what website owners see in Pay per Crawl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At scale, Cloudflare’s marketplace is a big idea that could offer publishers a potential business model for the AI era — and it also places Cloudflare at the center of it all. The launch of the marketplace comes at a time when news publishers are facing existential questions about how to reach readers, as Google Search traffic fades away and AI chatbots rise in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s not a clear answer for how news publishers will survive in the AI era. Some, such as The New York Times, have filed lawsuits against tech companies for training their AI models on news articles without permission. Meanwhile, other publishers have struck multi-year deals to license their content for AI model training and to have their content appear in AI chatbot responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even so, only large publishers have struck AI licensing deals, and it’s still unclear whether they provide meaningful sources of revenue. Cloudflare aims to create a more durable system where publishers can set prices on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced Tuesday that new websites set up with Cloudflare will now, by default, block all AI crawlers. Site owners will have to grant certain AI crawlers permission to access their site — a change Cloudflare says will give every new domain “the default of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several large publishers, including Conde Nast, TIME, The Associated Press, The Atlantic, ADWEEK, and Fortune, have signed on with Cloudflare to block AI crawlers by default in support of the company’s broader goal of a “permission-based approach to crawling.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The business model that many of these publishers relied on for decades is slowly becoming unreliable. Historically, online publishers have allowed Google to scrape their sites in return for referrals in Google Search, which translated to traffic to their sites, and ultimately, ad revenue. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, new data from Cloudflare suggests that publishers may be getting a worse deal in the AI era than in the Google Search era. While some websites cite ChatGPT as a major traffic source, that doesn’t appear to be the case broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This June, Cloudflare says it found that Google’s crawler scraped its websites 14 times for every referral it gave them. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s crawler scraped websites 1,700 times for every one referral, while Anthropic scraped websites 73,000 times for every referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI and Google are building AI agents that are designed to visit websites on behalf of users, collect information, and deliver it back to users directly. A future in which these tools are mainstream has huge implications for publishers that rely on readers visiting their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare notes that the “true potential” of  Pay per Crawl may emerge in an “agentic” future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What if an agentic paywall could operate at the network edge, entirely programmatically? Imagine asking your favorite deep research program to help you synthesize the latest cancer research or a legal brief, or just help you find the best restaurant in Soho — and then giving that agent a budget to spend to acquire the best and most relevant content,” Cloudflare said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To participate in Cloudflare’s experimental marketplace, AI companies and publishers must both be set up with Cloudflare accounts. In their accounts, both parties can set rates at which they’d like to buy and sell a “crawl” of the publisher’s content. Cloudflare acts as the intermediary in these transactions, charging the AI company and distributing the earnings to the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare spokesperson Ripley Park tells TechCrunch there are no stablecoins or cryptocurrency involved in Pay per Crawl at this time, even though many have suggested digital currency would be perfect for something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cloudflare’s marketplace feels like a bold vision for the future that requires a lot of publishers and AI companies to get on board. Still, there’s no guarantee publishers will get a good deal, and convincing AI firms to participate could be tough, given they’re currently scraping content for free.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Cloudflare seems like one of the few companies in a position to make a marketplace like this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article misstated OpenAI’s crawl-to-referral ratio in June, as reported by Cloudflare.

          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog Tuesday, Cloudflare explained that its "pay-per-crawl" feature is currently in a private beta. A small number of publishers and content creators will participate in the experiment. Each publisher will be able to set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content, Cloudflare said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, said the feature would ensure that the Internet as we know it will survive "the age of AI."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Original content is what makes the Internet one of the greatest inventions in the last century, and it's essential that creators continue making it," Prince said. "AI crawlers have been scraping content without limits. Our goal is to put the power back in the hands of creators, while still helping AI companies innovate. This is about safeguarding the future of a free and vibrant Internet with a new model that works for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some participating publishers expressed optimism in the press release that Cloudflare's pay-per-crawl feature could potentially stop the endless scraping that publishers defending copyrights have alleged represents wide-scale theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any content creators interested in joining the beta can sign up, Cloudflare noted, and perhaps eventually, they too can "be compensated for their contributions to the AI economy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, only the publishers involved in the beta will be able to choose which bots can access which parts of their sites, experimenting with blocking all bots or allowing certain bots to access certain content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's program also gives them the flexibility to charge some bots while letting other bots scrape for free. This lets publishers that have negotiated deals with AI companies to allow approved scraping while still protecting their content from companies that have not yet struck licensing deals.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;AI companies must buy in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare's plan to work, AI companies must sign up, too. However, while some AI companies may not see the incentive, Cloudflare has confirmed that it has partnered with AI companies on the initiative, which may benefit from having a simple interface to negotiate with content creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare suggested its AI partners benefit from "long-term collaboration" with creators whose updated content will help AI products stay relevant. They also can stop wasting money scraping poor quality data sources, a Cloudflare blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without ongoing contributions from content creators, AI systems risk becoming outdated, biased, or less reliable—ultimately diminishing user trust and the value of AI products," the blog said. "Cloudflare is working with AI companies to give them more signals, and ultimately improve the quality and relevance of content they can access. A healthy, sustainable ecosystem of original content is critical for AI innovation and relevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cloudflare's gamble seems to depend on AI companies agreeing to pay the prices set by publishers, and that could potentially scramble the experiment if bidding wars reduce rates to the point that they alienate publishers. It also hinges on Cloudflare detecting the AI bots, which, for now, relies on user reports and Cloudflare's analysis of mass traffic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the early days, price discovery will play a key role—as creators gain data on whoʼs paying for what, a transparent market will emerge that reflects the true value of original content," Cloudflare said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, Cloudflare suggested that its pay-per-crawl system would "evolve significantly." Perhaps one day publishers could use it to "charge different rates for different paths or content types," potentially even introducing dynamic pricing in the AI scraping environment. In that future, Cloudflare predicted that AI companies would possibly be incentivized to create agents that would crawl the web, seeking the best content deals to support specific AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Imagine asking your favorite deep research program to help you synthesize the latest cancer research or a legal brief, or just help you find the best restaurant in Soho—and then giving that agent a budget to spend to acquire the best and most relevant content," Cloudflare said, promising that "we enable a future where intelligent agents can programmatically negotiate access to digital resources."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI crawlers now blocked by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's announcement comes after rolling out a feature last September, allowing website owners to block AI crawlers in a single click. According to Cloudflare, over 1 million customers chose to block AI crawlers, signaling that people want more control over their content at a time when Cloudflare observed that writing instructions for AI crawlers in robots.txt files was widely "underutilized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect more customers moving forward, any new customers (including anyone on a free plan) who sign up for Cloudflare services will have their domains, by default, set to block all known AI crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks Cloudflare's transition away from the dreaded opt-out models of AI scraping to a permission-based model, which a Cloudflare spokesperson told Ars is expected to "fundamentally change how AI companies access web content going forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where some website owners have grown sick and tired of attempting and failing to block AI scraping through robots.txt—including some trapping AI crawlers in tarpits to punish them for ignoring robots.txt—Cloudflare's feature allows users to choose granular settings to prevent blocks on AI bots from impacting bots that drive search engine traffic. That's critical for small content creators who want their sites to still be discoverable but not digested by AI bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AI crawlers collect content like text, articles, and images to generate answers, without sending visitors to the original source—depriving content creators of revenue, and the satisfaction of knowing someone is reading their content," Cloudflare's blog said. "If the incentive to create original, quality content disappears, society ends up losing, and the future of the Internet is at risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Condé Nast, which owns Ars Technica, is a partner involved in Cloudflare’s beta test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was corrected on July 1 to remove publishers incorrectly listed as participating in Cloudflare's pay-per-crawl beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI companies must buy in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare's plan to work, AI companies must sign up, too. However, while some AI companies may not see the incentive, Cloudflare has confirmed that it has partnered with AI companies on the initiative, which may benefit from having a simple interface to negotiate with content creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare suggested its AI partners benefit from "long-term collaboration" with creators whose updated content will help AI products stay relevant. They also can stop wasting money scraping poor quality data sources, a Cloudflare blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without ongoing contributions from content creators, AI systems risk becoming outdated, biased, or less reliable—ultimately diminishing user trust and the value of AI products," the blog said. "Cloudflare is working with AI companies to give them more signals, and ultimately improve the quality and relevance of content they can access. A healthy, sustainable ecosystem of original content is critical for AI innovation and relevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cloudflare's gamble seems to depend on AI companies agreeing to pay the prices set by publishers, and that could potentially scramble the experiment if bidding wars reduce rates to the point that they alienate publishers. It also hinges on Cloudflare detecting the AI bots, which, for now, relies on user reports and Cloudflare's analysis of mass traffic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the early days, price discovery will play a key role—as creators gain data on whoʼs paying for what, a transparent market will emerge that reflects the true value of original content," Cloudflare said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, Cloudflare suggested that its pay-per-crawl system would "evolve significantly." Perhaps one day publishers could use it to "charge different rates for different paths or content types," potentially even introducing dynamic pricing in the AI scraping environment. In that future, Cloudflare predicted that AI companies would possibly be incentivized to create agents that would crawl the web, seeking the best content deals to support specific AI products.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine asking your favorite deep research program to help you synthesize the latest cancer research or a legal brief, or just help you find the best restaurant in Soho—and then giving that agent a budget to spend to acquire the best and most relevant content," Cloudflare said, promising that "we enable a future where intelligent agents can programmatically negotiate access to digital resources."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI crawlers now blocked by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's announcement comes after rolling out a feature last September, allowing website owners to block AI crawlers in a single click. According to Cloudflare, over 1 million customers chose to block AI crawlers, signaling that people want more control over their content at a time when Cloudflare observed that writing instructions for AI crawlers in robots.txt files was widely "underutilized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect more customers moving forward, any new customers (including anyone on a free plan) who sign up for Cloudflare services will have their domains, by default, set to block all known AI crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks Cloudflare's transition away from the dreaded opt-out models of AI scraping to a permission-based model, which a Cloudflare spokesperson told Ars is expected to "fundamentally change how AI companies access web content going forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where some website owners have grown sick and tired of attempting and failing to block AI scraping through robots.txt—including some trapping AI crawlers in tarpits to punish them for ignoring robots.txt—Cloudflare's feature allows users to choose granular settings to prevent blocks on AI bots from impacting bots that drive search engine traffic. That's critical for small content creators who want their sites to still be discoverable but not digested by AI bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AI crawlers collect content like text, articles, and images to generate answers, without sending visitors to the original source—depriving content creators of revenue, and the satisfaction of knowing someone is reading their content," Cloudflare's blog said. "If the incentive to create original, quality content disappears, society ends up losing, and the future of the Internet is at risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Condé Nast, which owns Ars Technica, is a partner involved in Cloudflare’s beta test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was corrected on July 1 to remove publishers incorrectly listed as participating in Cloudflare's pay-per-crawl beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cloudflare will also give clients the ability to manually allow or ban these AI bots on a case-by-case basis, and it will introduce a so-called “pay-per-crawl” service that clients can use to receive compensation every time an AI bot wants to scoop up their website’s contents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bots in question are a type of web crawler, an algorithm that walks across the internet to digest and catalogue online information on each website. In the past, web crawlers were most commonly associated with gathering data for search engines, but developers now use them to gather data they need to build and use AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, such systems don’t provide the same opportunities for monetization and credit as search engines historically have. AI models draw from a great deal of data on the web to generate their outputs, but these data sources are often not credited, limiting the creators’ ability to make money from their work. Search engines that feature AI-generated answers may include links to original sources, but they may also reduce people’s interest in clicking through to other sites and could even usher in a “zero-click” future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, the unspoken agreement was that a search engine could index your content, then they would show the relevant links to a particular query and send you traffic back to your website,” Will Allen, Cloudflare’s head of AI privacy, control, and media products, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. “That is fundamentally changing.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Generally, creators and publishers want to decide how their content is used, how it’s associated with them, and how they are paid for it. Cloudflare claims its clients can now allow or disallow crawling for each stage of the AI life cycle (in particular, training, fine-tuning, and inference) and white-list specific verified crawlers. Clients can also set a rate for how much it will cost AI bots to crawl their website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a press release from Cloudflare, media companies like the Associated Press and Time and forums like Quora and Stack Overflow voiced support for the move. “Community platforms that fuel LLMs should be compensated for their contributions so they can invest back in their communities,” Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar said in the release.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Crawlers are supposed to obey a given website’s directions (provided through a robots.txt file) to determine whether they can crawl there, but some AI companies have been accused of ignoring these instructions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare already has a bot verification system where AI web crawlers can tell websites who they work for and what they want to do. For these, Cloudflare hopes its system can facilitate good-faith negotiations between AI companies and website owners. For the less honest crawlers, Cloudflare plans to use its experience dealing with coordinated denial-of-service attacks from bots to stop them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A web crawler that is going across the internet looking for the latest content is just another type of bot—so all of our work to understand traffic and network patterns for the clearly malicious bots helps us understand what a crawler is doing,” wrote Allen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare had already developed other ways to deter unwanted crawlers, like allowing websites to send them down a path of AI-generated fake web pages to waste their efforts. While this approach will still apply for the truly bad actors, the company says it hopes its new services can foster better relationships between AI companies and content producers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some caution that a default ban on AI crawlers could interfere with noncommercial uses, like research.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The news: &lt;/strong&gt;The internet infrastructure company Cloudflare has announced that it will start blocking AI bots from visiting websites it hosts by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What bots? &lt;/strong&gt;The bots in question are a type of web crawler, an algorithm that walks across the internet then digests and catalogs information on each website. In the past, web crawlers were most commonly associated with gathering data for search engines, but developers now use them to gather data they need to build and use AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, are all bots banned?&lt;/strong&gt; Not quite. Cloudflare will also give clients the ability to allow or ban these AI bots on a case-by-case basis, and plans to introduce a so-called “pay-per-crawl” service that clients can use to receive compensation every time an AI bot wants to scoop up their website’s contents.

This is a big deal!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are dozens of similar copyright lawsuits working through the courts right now, and their outcomes are set to have an enormous impact on the future of AI.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a post on X, the financial giant said xAI had raised $5 billion in debt and another $5 billion in a separate strategic equity transaction.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The combination of debt and equity reduces the overall cost of capital and substantially expands pools of capital available to xAI.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded last December by Zhou Xian (pictured above, left), who holds a PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, and Théophile Gervet (pictured above, right), a former research scientist with the French AI lab Mistral, the startup wants to build a general-purpose model that will enable robots to automate a wide range of repetitive tasks, from lab work to housekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Large language models are trained on vast datasets of text, but AI models for robotics must be trained on data on the physical world. However, acquiring that real-world data makes for a costly and time-consuming endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To overcome that, Genesis is turning to synthetic data, which it generates using a proprietary physics engine that, it says, is capable of accurately modeling the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genesis’ synthetic data engine originated from an academic project that Xian led in collaboration with researchers from 18 universities. Several participants from that project have since joined Genesis, making up its current staff of over 20 researchers who specialize in robotics, machine learning, and graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genesis claims its proprietary simulation engine allows it to develop models faster, a distinct advantage over competitors who rely on Nvidia’s software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other companies working on developing general-purpose AI models for robots include Physical Intelligence, which raised a $400 million round, and Skild AI, which was valued at $4 billion earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a big unknown: Will anybody have a large robotics foundation model that will generalize across tasks? That’s a bet we want to go after,” Kanu Gulati, a partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Of all the teams we have seen, we like [Genesis’] approach for going after robotics foundation models,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genesis is developing its synthetic data and building the foundational model across two offices, in Silicon Valley and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI, a startup based in Washington, D.C., is developing an AI solution that could enable the next generation of data centers to come online sooner by tapping existing energy resources in a more flexible and strategic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, the power grid has treated data centers as inflexible — energy system operators assume that a 500-megawatt AI factory will always require access to that full amount of power,” said Varun Sivaram, founder and CEO of Emerald AI. “But in moments of need, when demands on the grid peak and supply is short, the workloads that drive AI factory energy use can now be flexible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That flexibility is enabled by the startup’s Emerald Conductor platform, an AI-powered system that acts as a smart mediator between the grid and a data center. In a recent field test in Phoenix, Arizona, the company and its partners demonstrated that its software can reduce the power consumption of AI workloads running on a cluster of 256 NVIDIA GPUs by 25% over three hours during a grid stress event while preserving compute service quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI achieved this by orchestrating the host of different workloads that AI factories run. Some jobs can be paused or slowed, like the training or fine-tuning of a large language model for academic research. Others, like inference queries for an AI service used by thousands or even millions of people, can’t be rescheduled, but could be redirected to another data center where the local power grid is less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald Conductor coordinates these AI workloads across a network of data centers to meet power grid demands, ensuring full performance of time-sensitive workloads while dynamically reducing the throughput of flexible workloads within acceptable limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond helping AI factories come online using existing power systems, this ability to modulate power usage could help cities avoid rolling blackouts, protect communities from rising utility rates and make it easier for the grid to integrate clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renewable energy, which is intermittent and variable, is easier to add to a grid if that grid has lots of shock absorbers that can shift with changes in power supply,” said Ayse Coskun, Emerald AI’s chief scientist and a professor at Boston University. “Data centers can become some of those shock absorbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups and an NVentures portfolio company, Emerald AI today announced more than $24 million in seed funding. Its Phoenix demonstration, part of EPRI’s DCFlex data center flexibility initiative, was executed in collaboration with NVIDIA, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and the regional power utility Salt River Project (SRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Phoenix technology trial validates the vast potential of an essential element in data center flexibility,” said Anuja Ratnayake, who leads EPRI’s DCFlex Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPRI is also leading the Open Power AI Consortium, a group of energy companies, researchers and technology companies — including NVIDIA — working on AI applications for the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using the Grid to Its Full Potential&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric grid capacity is typically underused except during peak events like hot summer days or cold winter storms, when there’s a high power demand for cooling and heating. That means, in many cases, there’s room on the existing grid for new data centers, as long as they can temporarily dial down energy usage during periods of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent Duke University study estimates that if new AI data centers could flex their electricity consumption by just 25% for two hours at a time, less than 200 hours a year, they could unlock 100 gigawatts of new capacity to connect data centers — equivalent to over $2 trillion in data center investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quote from article" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-82912" height="384" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pullquote_emeraldai-960x384.png" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Putting AI Factory Flexibility to the Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerald AI’s recent trial was conducted in the Oracle Cloud Phoenix Region on NVIDIA GPUs spread across a multi-rack cluster managed through Databricks MosaicML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rapid delivery of high-performance compute to AI customers is critical but is constrained by grid power availability,” said Pradeep Vincent, chief technical architect and senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which supplied cluster power telemetry for the trial. “Compute infrastructure that is responsive to real-time grid conditions while meeting the performance demands unlocks a new model for scaling AI — faster, greener and more grid-aware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, guided the trial’s selection of AI workloads and their flexibility thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a certain level of latent flexibility in how AI workloads are typically run,” Frankle said. “Often, a small percentage of jobs are truly non-preemptible, whereas many jobs such as training, batch inference or fine-tuning have different priority levels depending on the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Arizona is among the top states for data center growth, SRP set challenging flexibility targets for the AI compute cluster — a 25% power consumption reduction compared with baseline load — in an effort to demonstrate how new data centers can provide meaningful relief to Phoenix’s power grid constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This test was an opportunity to completely reimagine AI data centers as helpful resources to help us operate the power grid more effectively and reliably,” said David Rousseau, president of SRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 3, a hot day in Phoenix with high air-conditioning demand, SRP’s system experienced peak demand at 6 p.m. During the test, the data center cluster reduced consumption gradually with a 15-minute ramp down, maintained the 25% power reduction over three hours, then ramped back up without exceeding its original baseline consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI factory users can label their workloads to guide Emerald’s software on which jobs can be slowed, paused or rescheduled — or, Emerald’s AI agents can make these predictions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

Flex 1 allows up to 10% average throughput reduction, Flex 2 up to 25% and Flex 3 up to 50% over a six-hour period. Figure courtesy of Emerald AI.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestration decisions were guided by the Emerald Simulator, which accurately models system behavior to optimize trade-offs between energy usage and AI performance. Historical grid demand from data provider Amperon confirmed that the AI cluster performed correctly during the grid’s peak period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_82918"&gt;&lt;img alt="Line graph showing power usage over time on May 2, 2025, for simulator, AI cluster and individual jobs." class="size-medium wp-image-82918" height="540" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image3-960x540.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-82918"&gt;Comparison of Emerald Simulator prediction of AI GPU cluster power with real-world measured power consumption. Figure courtesy of Emerald AI.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forging an Energy-Resilient Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency projects that electricity demand from data centers globally could more than double by 2030. In light of the anticipated demand on the grid, the state of Texas passed a law that requires data centers to ramp down consumption or disconnect from the grid at utilities’ requests during load shed events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In such situations, if data centers are able to dynamically reduce their energy consumption, they might be able to avoid getting kicked off the power supply entirely,” Sivaram said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Emerald AI is expanding its technology trials in Arizona and beyond — and it plans to continue working with NVIDIA to test its technology on AI factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can make data centers controllable while assuring acceptable AI performance,” Sivaram said. “AI factories can flex when the grid is tight — and sprint when users need them to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The provision to the reconciliation bill was introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Many prominent Silicon Valley executives — including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and a16z’s Marc Andreessen — were in favor of the so-called “AI moratorium,” which they said would prevent states from forming an unworkable patchwork of regulation that could stifle AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Opposition to the provision became a bipartisan issue, as most Democrats and many Republicans warned that the ban on state regulation would harm consumers, and let powerful AI companies operate with little oversight. Critics also objected to Cruz’s plan to tie compliance with federal broadband funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After going back and forth over the provision, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) on Monday offered an amendment to strip the provision alongside Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blackburn (pictured above) originally opposed the provision, but came to an agreement with Cruz over the weekend that shortened the proposed ban from 10 years to five. Blackburn then pulled her support for the provision entirely on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

Neither companies provided details about the financial terms of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Superhuman was founded by Rahul Vohra, Vivek Sodera, and Conrad Irwin. The company raised more than $114 million in funding from backers including a16z, IVP, and Tiger Global, with its last valuation at $825 million, according to data from venture data analytics firm Traxcn.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn’t exist anywhere else. Email isn’t just another app; it’s where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it’s the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously,” Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Grammarly, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this deal, CEO Vohra and other Superhuman employees are moving over to Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Email is the main communication tool for billions of people worldwide and the number-one use case for Grammarly customers. By joining forces with Grammarly, we will invest even more in the core Superhuman experience, as well as create a new way of working where AI agents collaborate across the communication tools that we all use every day,” Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last few months, Superhuman has released AI-powered features related to scheduling, replies, and categorization. In its announcement, Grammarly said that it wants to build AI agents for emails using Superhuman’s tech. The company said that email remains one of the top use cases for Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than giving up equity, the company will pay back General Catalyst the money with a capped percentage of revenue it creates using the venture firm’s money.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/grammarly-acquires-ai-email-client-superhuman/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:25:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Flood of interest in Europe’s AI Gigafactories plan (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/flood-of-interest-in-europe-ai-gigafactories-plan/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has seen a flood of interest from companies looking to help create AI Gigafactories across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brussels has been virtually swamped with proposals for new AI Gigafactories. 76 expressions of interest have been submitted, covering 60 potential sites across 16 EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response has clearly energised officials who see it as vindication of their strategy to position Europe as a serious player in the global AI race.

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Facing overwhelming opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) accepted defeat and joined a 99-1 vote against his own plan to punish states that regulate artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Senate came together tonight to say that we can't just run over good state consumer protection laws," Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said. The Cruz plan would have thwarted state laws related to robocalls, deepfakes, and autonomous vehicles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House previously approved a budget bill with a provision to ban state AI regulation for 10 years. The Senate has a rule against including "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation, which Cruz tried to get around by proposing a 10-year moratorium in which states would be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they try to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed the overall budget bill today in a 51-50 vote. Cruz's office said in early June that his proposal aimed to prevent states "from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation." Less than three weeks later, his home state of Texas enacted a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz changed his plan, saying that states regulating AI would only be shut out of a $500 million AI fund instead of the $42 billion broadband fund. But Cantwell's office said the new version contained a backdoor that could still threaten states' access to the entire broadband fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) teamed up with Cantwell to fight Cruz's plan. Blackburn briefly reached a compromise with Cruz on a five-year moratorium that would allow some forms of AI regulation but then decided the compromise wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While I appreciate Chairman Cruz's efforts to find acceptable language that allows states to protect their citizens from the abuses of AI, the current language is not acceptable to those who need these protections the most," Blackburn said in a statement quoted by Politico last night. "This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens."&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cruz blamed “outside interests”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the compromise fell apart, the Senate voted 99-1 for Blackburn's amendment to remove the AI provision from the budget bill. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) cast the only vote against the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cruz ultimately got behind Blackburn's amendment early Tuesday, acknowledging that 'many of my colleagues would prefer not to vote on this matter,'" according to The Hill. Cruz said the five-year moratorium had support from President Trump and "protected kids and protected the rights of creative artists, but outside interests opposed that deal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Blackburn was quoted as saying that they "weren't able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language... what we know is this—this body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell pointed out that many state government officials from both major parties opposed the Cruz plan. "Despite several revisions by its author and misleading assurances about its true impact, state officials from across the country, including 17 Republican Governors and 40 state attorneys general, as well [as] conservative and liberal organizations—from the Heritage Foundation to the Center for American Progress—rallied against the harmful proposal," Cantwell's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) had also filed an amendment to strip the AI moratorium from the bill. Markey said yesterday that "the Blackburn-Cruz so-called compromise is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Despite Republican efforts to hide the true impact of the AI moratorium, the language still allows the Trump administration to use federal broadband funding as a weapon against the states and still prevents states from protecting children online from Big Tech's predatory behavior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell said at a recent press conference that 24 states last year started "regulating AI in some way, and they have adopted these laws that fill a gap while we are waiting for federal action." Yesterday, she called the Blackburn/Cruz compromise "another giveaway to tech companies" that "gives AI and social media a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Senate came together tonight to say that we can't just run over good state consumer protection laws," Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said. The Cruz plan would have thwarted state laws related to robocalls, deepfakes, and autonomous vehicles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House previously approved a budget bill with a provision to ban state AI regulation for 10 years. The Senate has a rule against including "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation, which Cruz tried to get around by proposing a 10-year moratorium in which states would be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they try to regulate AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed the overall budget bill today in a 51-50 vote. Cruz's office said in early June that his proposal aimed to prevent states "from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation." Less than three weeks later, his home state of Texas enacted a law regulating the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruz changed his plan, saying that states regulating AI would only be shut out of a $500 million AI fund instead of the $42 billion broadband fund. But Cantwell's office said the new version contained a backdoor that could still threaten states' access to the entire broadband fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) teamed up with Cantwell to fight Cruz's plan. Blackburn briefly reached a compromise with Cruz on a five-year moratorium that would allow some forms of AI regulation but then decided the compromise wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While I appreciate Chairman Cruz's efforts to find acceptable language that allows states to protect their citizens from the abuses of AI, the current language is not acceptable to those who need these protections the most," Blackburn said in a statement quoted by Politico last night. "This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can't block states from making laws that protect their citizens."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cruz blamed “outside interests”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the compromise fell apart, the Senate voted 99-1 for Blackburn's amendment to remove the AI provision from the budget bill. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) cast the only vote against the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cruz ultimately got behind Blackburn's amendment early Tuesday, acknowledging that 'many of my colleagues would prefer not to vote on this matter,'" according to The Hill. Cruz said the five-year moratorium had support from President Trump and "protected kids and protected the rights of creative artists, but outside interests opposed that deal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Blackburn was quoted as saying that they "weren't able to come to a compromise that would protect our governors, our state legislators, our attorney generals and, of course, House members who have expressed concern over this language... what we know is this—this body has proven that they cannot legislate on emerging technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell pointed out that many state government officials from both major parties opposed the Cruz plan. "Despite several revisions by its author and misleading assurances about its true impact, state officials from across the country, including 17 Republican Governors and 40 state attorneys general, as well [as] conservative and liberal organizations—from the Heritage Foundation to the Center for American Progress—rallied against the harmful proposal," Cantwell's office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) had also filed an amendment to strip the AI moratorium from the bill. Markey said yesterday that "the Blackburn-Cruz so-called compromise is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Despite Republican efforts to hide the true impact of the AI moratorium, the language still allows the Trump administration to use federal broadband funding as a weapon against the states and still prevents states from protecting children online from Big Tech's predatory behavior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantwell said at a recent press conference that 24 states last year started "regulating AI in some way, and they have adopted these laws that fill a gap while we are waiting for federal action." Yesterday, she called the Blackburn/Cruz compromise "another giveaway to tech companies" that "gives AI and social media a brand-new shield against litigation and state regulation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech behemoth now has 1 million robots in its warehouses, the company announced Monday. This one millionth robot was recently delivered to an Amazon fulfillment facility in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That figure puts Amazon on track to reach another landmark: Its vast network of warehouses may soon have the same number of robots working as people, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ also reported that 75% of Amazon’s global deliveries are now assisted in some way by a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reached out to Amazon for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced it’s releasing a new generative AI model called DeepFleet for its warehouse robots. This AI model, which can coordinate the robots’ routes within the company’s warehouses more efficiently, will help increase the speed of its robotic fleet by 10%, according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company used Amazon SageMaker — the AWS cloud studio that helps build and deploy AI models — to create DeepFleet. Amazon trained the model on its own warehouse and inventory data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon’s one millionth robot represents more than just a number. The company has improved its fleet of robots in recent years, adding new capabilities and models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May, the company unveiled its latest robot, Vulcan. This model has two arms, one designed for rearranging inventory and another with a camera and suction cup to grab items. Most notably, these Vulcan robots have a sense of “touch” that allows it to feel the items it is grabbing, according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October 2024, the company announced its “next-generation fulfillment centers,” which would include 10x as many robots as their current facilities, in addition to human workers. The first of these new robotic-powered centers opened shortly after in Shreveport, Louisiana, near the Texas border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon originally started building up its robotic capabilities back in 2012 alongside its acquisition of Kiva Systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/download-3.webp?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After 13 years of deploying robots into its warehouses, Amazon reached a new milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
