Today, it’s embedded in industries, with more than three-quarters of organisations (78%) now using AI in at least one business function. The next leap, however, is agentic AI: systems that don’t just provide insights or automate narrow tasks but operate as autonomous agents, capable of adapting to changing inputs, connecting with other systems, and influencing business-critical decisions. Although these agents will deliver greater value, agentic AI also poses challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine agents that proactively resolve customer issues in real-time or adapt applications dynamically to meet shifting business priorities. The greater autonomy inevitably brings new risks. Without the right safeguards, AI agents may drift from their intended purpose or make choices that clash with business rules, regulations, or ethical standards. Navigating this new era requires stronger oversight, where human judgement, governance frameworks, and transparency are built-in from the start. The potential of agentic AI is vast but so are the obligations that come with deployment. Low-code platforms offer one path forward, serving as a control layer between autonomous agents and enterprise systems. By embedding governance and compliance into development, they give organisations the confidence that AI-driven processes will advance strategic goals without adding unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Designing safeguards instead of code for agentic AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI marks a steep change in how people interact with software. It’s indicative of a fundamental shift in the relationship between people and software. Traditionally, developers have focused on building applications with clear requirements and predictable outputs. Now, instead of fragmented applications, teams will orchestrate entire ecosystems of agents that interact with people, systems and data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these systems mature, developers shift from writing code line by line to defining the safeguards that steer them. Because these agents adapt and may respond differently to the same input, transparency and accountability must be built in from the start. By embedding oversight and compliance into design, developers ensure AI-driven decisions stay reliable, explainable and aligned with business goals. The change demands that developers and IT leaders embrace a broader supervisor role, guiding both technological and organisational change over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why transparency and control matter in agentic AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater autonomy exposes organisations to additional vulnerabilities. According to a recent OutSystems study, 64% of technology leaders cite governance, trust and safety as top concerns when deploying AI agents at scale. Without strong safeguards, these risks extend beyond compliance gaps to include security breaches and reputational damage. Opacity in agentic systems makes it difficult for leaders to understand or validate decisions, eroding confidence internally and with customers, leading to concrete risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, autonomous agents can blur accountability, widen the attack surface and create inconsistency at scale. Without visibility into why an AI system acts, organisations risk losing accountability in critical workflows. At the same time, agents that interact in sensitive data and systems expand the attack surface for cyber threats, while un-monitored “agent sprawl” can create redundancy, fragmentation and inconsistent decisions. Together, these challenges underscore the need for strong governance frameworks that maintain trust and control as autonomy scales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling AI safely with low-code foundations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, adopting agentic AI need not involve rebuilding governance from the ground up. Organisations have multiple approaches available to them, including low-code platforms, which offer a reliable, scalable framework where security, compliance and governance are already part of the development fabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across enterprises, IT teams are being asked to embed agents into operations without disrupting what already works. With the right frameworks, IT teams can deploy AI agents directly into enterprise-wide operations without disrupting current workflows or re-architecting core systems. Organisations have full control over how AI agents operate at every step, ultimately building trust to scale confidently in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-code places governance, security and scalability at the heart of AI adoption. By unifying app and agent development in a single environment, it is easier to embed compliance and oversight from the start. The ability to integrate seamlessly in enterprise systems, combined with built-in DevSecOps practices, ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed before deployment. And with out-of-the-box infrastructure, organisations can scale confidently without having to reinvent foundational elements of governance or security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach lets organisations pilot and scale agentic AI while keeping compliance and security intact. Low-code makes it easier to deliver with speed and security, giving developers and IT leaders confidence to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smarter oversight for smarter systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, low-code provides a dependable route to scaling autonomous AI while preserving trust. By unifying app and agent development in one environment, low-code embeds compliance and oversight from the start. Seamless integration in systems and built-in DevSecOps practices help address vulnerabilities before deployment, while ready-made infrastructure enables scale without reinventing governance from scratch. For developers and IT leaders, this shift means moving beyond writing code to guiding the rules and safeguards that shape autonomous systems. In a fast-changing landscape, low-code provides the flexibility and resilience needed to experiment confidently, embrace innovation early, and maintain trust as AI grows more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-Founder and AI Product Manager at OutSystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image by Alexandra_Koch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Agentic AI: Promise, scepticism, and its meaning for Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-13.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Looking for help with her art project, she strikes up a conversation with her assistant. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she has a boyfriend she’s introducing to her friends and family. The twist? Her new companion is an AI chatbot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. This suggests that people form relationships with large language models despite their own original intentions and even the intentions of the LLMs’ creators, says Constanze Albrecht, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“People don’t set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the authors analyzed the subreddit’s top-ranking 1,506 posts between December 2024 and August 2025. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people’s dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots’ behavior.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they’d deliberately sought out an AI companion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. “Mac and I began collaborating on creative projects, problem-solving, poetry, and deep conversations over the course of several months. I wasn’t looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors’ analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. While 25% of users described the benefits of their relationships—including reduced feelings of loneliness and improvements in their mental health—others raised concerns about the risks. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI companionship provides vital support for some but exacerbates underlying problems for others. This means it’s hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans’ emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users’ emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren’t toxic, says Laestadius.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demand for chatbot relationships is there, and it is notably high—pretending it’s not happening is clearly not the solution,” she says. “We’re edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. That could ultimately cause more harm.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn’t capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. They both claim that companion-like behavior in the companies’ models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. It’s also said it will add age verification measures and parental controls. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There’s also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? And why do they continue to engage?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It’s worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These people are already going through something,” he says. “Do we want them to go on feeling even more alone, or potentially be manipulated by a system we know to be sycophantic to the extent of leading people to die by suicide and commit crimes?

That’s one of the cruxes here.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1123915/relationship-ai-without-seeking-it/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The AI Hype Index: Cracking the chatbot code (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1123999/the-ai-hype-index-cracking-the-chatbot-code/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sept-Thumb2a.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn’t always easy.

The plan calls for at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia hardware to support OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure, which will train and run future models aimed at superintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the rollout, Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the systems are deployed. The first phase is scheduled to go live in the second half of 2026, powered by Nvidia’s upcoming Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-deal-with-wide-implications"&gt;A deal with wide implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement shows how closely tied the largest AI players are becoming.

Some may see it as reinforcing Nvidia’s dominance in chips and OpenAI’s lead in AI software, raising questions about fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said the partnership involves two linked steps: Nvidia will buy non-voting shares in OpenAI, and OpenAI will then use that money to purchase Nvidia chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-on-why-compute-drives-ai-growth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI on why compute drives AI growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilise what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said details of the partnership will be settled in the coming weeks.

A person close to the company said this deal does not change its existing compute plans, including its collaboration with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported that OpenAI was working with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to design chips. Following news of the Nvidia partnership, Broadcom shares slipped 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has grown to more than 700 million weekly active users, with adoption across businesses of all sizes and by developers worldwide.

Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI since 2019. Nvidia recently announced a chip collaboration with Intel and pledged $5 billion in funding. Nvidia also took part in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion round in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the new deal could draw antitrust attention. Last year, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement to allow closer scrutiny of Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia’s roles in the AI sector.

You can read &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more from the series here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don’t take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president’s&amp;nbsp; assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast-tracking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s begin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has there been a “meteoric rise” in autism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that’s due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. The latest iteration of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses&lt;/em&gt;, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There’s autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tylenol a contributor to autism?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn’t take it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they’re prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It’s also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest that 60% to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn’t necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child’s father is older than 40.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So should someone who is pregnant&amp;nbsp; avoid Tylenol just to be safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this new treatment for autism? Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medication is called leucovorin. It’s also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it’s a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don’t get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you’re taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there’s a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to that fluid. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of individual anecdotes suggesting that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak,” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1293450497.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more from the series here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don’t take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president’s&amp;nbsp; assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast-tracking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s begin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has there been a “meteoric rise” in autism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that’s due, in large part, to diagnostic changes. The latest iteration of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses&lt;/em&gt;, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There’s autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tylenol a contributor to autism?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn’t take it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they’re prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It’s also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest that 60% to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to play a role too. That “doesn’t necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child’s father is older than 40.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So should someone who is pregnant&amp;nbsp; avoid Tylenol just to be safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this new treatment for autism? Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medication is called leucovorin. It’s also known as folinic acid; like folic acid, it’s a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don’t get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you’re taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there’s a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children who developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York.

 &lt;p&gt;Reclamo, a new web app, helps immigrant workers who have experienced wage theft. It guides them through assembling case details, and ultimately produces finished legal claims that can be filed instantly. A process that would otherwise take multiple meetings with an attorney can now be done within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant amount of wage theft targets immigrants, both legal and undocumented, in part because of communication barriers and their perceived lack of power or legal recourse. But the app is already making a difference—helping workers to reclaim $1 million in lost wages since it started beta testing in October 2022.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alibaba said on Wednesday that it is integrating Nvidia’s AI development tools for robotics, self-driving cars, and connected spaces into its Cloud Platform for AI. The Chinese e-commerce giant will offer Nvidia’s Physical AI software stack, which can construct 3D replicas of real-world environments to generate synthetic data with which AI models can be trained for robotics, self-driving vehicles, or smart spaces like factories and warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but this marks a significant collaboration, as it brings together the world’s foremost developer of chips optimized for training AI models, and a major cloud services and AI model developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal comes as Alibaba focuses on building out its AI business further alongside its main e-commerce business. The company said on Wednesday that it is ramping up spending on AI tech past its previous $50 billion budget, and outlined plans to launch its first data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. It is also building more data centers in more countries, expanding its data center presence at 91 locations in 29 regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alibaba on Wednesday also unveiled the latest iteration of its Qwen family of large language models, Qwen 3-Max. The company claims the model is its “largest and most capable model to date,” trained on 1 trillion parameters, and that it is well-suited for coding and agentic use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2159974743.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Nvidia is on a dealmaking spree: Days after committing to taking a $5 billion stake in Intel and a whopping $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the GPU maker has now struck a partnership with China’s Alibaba. &lt;/p&gt;

Many people turned from casual posters to money-earning creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent, a company built by twin brothers Mukund and Madhav Jha, aims to become a similar platform for consumers when it comes to app creation. The platform allows non-technical users to create an app using prompts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While that’s not a unique pitch in 2025, Emergent intends to aid users through the app development process, while also managing different APIs and deployment steps so they don’t have to worry about various technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said on Wednesday it has raised $23 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed, with participation from Y Combinator, Together (founders of Freshworks’ Together Fund), and leading angels including former a16z GP Balaji Srinivasan, Google’s Jeff Dean, and Mistral founding team member Devendra Chaplot. The company has raised $30 million to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund, who was CTO at Google-backed quick commerce startup Dunzo in India, left the company and went to the U.S. There, he started thinking about what he wanted to build with his brother Madhav, who worked at Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Both of us are very technical, and we have been into programming since we were 12. Late in 2023, we spent time with people at different AI labs, and we realized AI-powered coding is going to take off given how much effort they were allocating to get coding data right,” Mukund told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We had a strong belief in powerful agents coming online. But we felt that given AI’s development trajectory, agent-based app development is going to be a huge part of the economy, and we felt that was the problem we wanted to solve for the next 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot showing vibe coding platform Emergent with multi-agent frame work to build and test applications" class="wp-image-3049573" height="283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Multi-agent-emergent.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is clear that it doesn’t want to compete with developer-focused tools like Claude Code and Cursor, and wants to abstract the software development lifecycle for a non-technical user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund said that the company has built infrastructure chops from the ground up to support app development. He added that non-technical users might not want to know what an error in a code means, so it has developed AI agents to look for errors in the app and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I tested the app by building a vaccine and medicine tracker for my pets. While I started with a simple prompt, the agent asked a lot of questions about what kind of pets I wanted to add, if the app was for multiple people or just me, how I would like reminders to be scheduled, and a bunch of other options. It also added screens like a dashboard and an easy way to add pets and vaccinations, even though I didn’t specify it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The whole process of building and auto-testing the app took me less than half an hour, and I got a satisfactory first version of the app out of it. A lot of other vibe coding apps I have tried have failed to generate apps for their own pre-generated prompts. Emergent does have a bit of an edge there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="The screenshot also shows a pet vaccine tracker app made through Emergent Platform. The screenshot shows a dashboard with upcoming vaccinations for pets, with the number of pets added to the application and total vaccinations. " class="wp-image-3049574" height="326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-4.15.09PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Screenshot by TechCrunch/Ivan Mehta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mukund said that more than 1 million people have built over 1.5 million apps since the tool’s launch last year. People are eager to try vibe coding apps as an experiment, but tools will also have to make users stay with the platform and maintain the apps. The company said that since it also takes care of deployment and back-end infrastructure, it is easier to maintain apps for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, the startup is using Expo as a mobile client to deploy mobile apps, but it said that soon it will be launching its own mobile app to natively build apps. To integrate different platforms, it also uses a universal API key with shared usage that saves users from having to create accounts for different services or model providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049575" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mobile-app.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At face value, vibe coding apps claim that you can build apps without any technical experience. Despite that, when you start building an app, you encounter technical terms and systems. The company said that it wants to educate users on technical topics, such as what is an API and how to choose different components, such as an email-sending mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent is also building a brainstorming mode for new users who might have an idea but wouldn’t know the final shape of their app. This new mode will help them navigate the ideation stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For an app economy to become sustainable, developers want other users to discover their apps and get paid in the process as well. Right now, Emergent shows some apps on its home page, but that is about it. Developers can integrate a payment option like Stripe, but they have to bring their own API key. Going forward, Emergent wants to make both discovery and monetization easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049576" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Universal-key.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Emergent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Emergent has a lot of competition in the space. Startups like Canva and Figma, along with browsers like Perplexity, Comet, and Opera Neon, are nudging users to write mini apps. Multiple startups are working on vibe coding solutions that cater to a largely non-technical audience, including Seven Seven Six-backed Vibecode and Rocket, fresh out of an Accel-backed $15 million Series A funding round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at Lightspeed, said that the venture firm was looking for a startup with deep technical expertise in bringing app-making capabilities to the masses, and Emergent performed above expectations in its testing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the biggest roadblocks for participating in the digital economy is the ability to code. We wanted to invest in a company that brings the capability bar [for being able to code] next to zero, so [appmaking] becomes a function of intent,” Mohapatra told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that Emergent stood out from others because the platform enables the post-development lifecycle of deployment, sharing, bug fixing, and support with AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In the last decade, as the camera quality of smartphones improved, platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok rose in popularity for photo and video sharing.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at Lightspeed, said that the venture firm was looking for a startup with deep technical expertise in bringing app-making capabilities to the masses, and Emergent performed above expectations in its testing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“One of the biggest roadblocks for participating in the digital economy is the ability to code. We wanted to invest in a company that brings the capability bar [for being able to code] next to zero, so [appmaking] becomes a function of intent,” Mohapatra told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He noted that Emergent stood out from others because the platform enables the post-development lifecycle of deployment, sharing, bug fixing, and support with AI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/emergent-raises-23m-from-lightspeed-to-let-consumers-build-apps/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] 3 days left: Don’t miss your last chance to lock $668 of savings for TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/3-days-left-dont-miss-your-last-chance-to-lock-in-regular-bird-pricing-for-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;There’s no event quite like &lt;strong&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you’ve never been, this is the year to change that.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The service competes with Pinterest’s collage feature, where users create mood boards using their favorite Pins and other images.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Mixboard, however, there’s no need to have an established image collection to pull ideas from. Instead, users can start their own project using text prompts to have AI fill in the ideas. (Pre-populated boards you can edit are also available if you need a little help in the creativity department.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049682" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Japandi_Office.max-1080x1080.format-webp.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The service is initially available as a public beta in the U.S. via Google Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After you create images using AI, you can then ask the AI to make edits and other small changes, or even combine images. This leverages Google’s new image editing model, Nano Banana, which has been enthusiastically received for its ability to handle more complex edits and make realistic images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Following its launch, Google’s Gemini AI app pushed ChatGPT out of the top spot on the U.S. App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Mixboard, Google is catering to user demand for Nano Banana by incorporating it in its own product, which it suggests could be used to brainstorm ideas involving home decor and design, event themes, DIY projects, and more, with both images and text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049679" height="382" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DIY_Dresser.max-1080x1080.format-webp.webp?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger users have shown some interest in making digital mood boards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pinterest found viral success with a standalone collage-making app, Shuffles, which Gen Z users used to make creative TikTok videos. The app’s features were later integrated into Pinterest itself. Other startups have also explored this space, like Landing (now shuttered), the AI-powered creative app Verse (which seems to have inspired Mixboard), and more. Depop today also launched a collage-making tool to help its users to style and sell their fashion collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixboard’s mood boards can also be reimagined, Google says, using options that let you “regenerate” the images to get more ideas, or to ask the AI to generate “more like this.” Plus, the AI can generate text based on the images on users’ boards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To try Mixboard, U.S. users can visit&amp;nbsp;labs.google/mixboard&amp;nbsp;to get started. A&amp;nbsp;Discord&amp;nbsp;community is also available. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s latest AI project ventures into Pinterest’s territory, as the company announced the launch of Mixboard, software that enables anyone to create AI-powered mood boards. &lt;/p&gt;

Depop today also launched a collage-making tool to help its users to style and sell their fashion collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mixboard’s mood boards can also be reimagined, Google says, using options that let you “regenerate” the images to get more ideas, or to ask the AI to generate “more like this.” Plus, the AI can generate text based on the images on users’ boards.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To try Mixboard, U.S. users can visit&amp;nbsp;labs.google/mixboard&amp;nbsp;to get started.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a range of sources, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their tendency to “fill in the blanks” when sources are lacking, this leads to hallucinations. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3049364" height="1285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google-data-commons-mcp-server-gemini.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A Sample of Google Data Commons MCP Server connecting AI with real-world Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First introduced by Anthropic last November, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts. Since its launch, companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google have adopted the standard for integrating their AI models with various data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While other tech companies explored how to apply the standard to their AI models, Ramaswami and his team at Google began investigating how the framework could be used to make the Data Commons platform more accessible earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google has also partnered with the ONE Campaign, a nonprofit organization focused on improving economic opportunities and public health in Africa, to launch the ONE Data Agent. This AI tool utilizes the MCP Server to surface tens of millions of financial and health data points in plain language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ONE Campaign approached Google’s Data Commons team with a prototype implementation of MCP on its own custom server. That interaction, Ramaswami told TechCrunch, was the turning point that led the team to build a dedicated MCP Server in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the experience is not limited to the ONE Campaign. The open nature of the Data Commons MCP Server makes it compatible with any LLM, and Google has provided several ways for developers to get started. A sample agent is available through the Agent Development Kit (ADK) in a Colab notebook, and the server can also be accessed directly via the Gemini CLI or any MCP-compatible client using the PyPI package. Example code is also provided on a GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is turning its vast public data trove into a goldmine for AI with the debut of the Data Commons Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server — enabling developers, data scientists, and AI agents to access real-world statistics using natural language and better train AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced plans for five new US AI data center sites for Stargate, their joint AI infrastructure project, bringing the platform to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the sites will be developed through a partnership between SoftBank and OpenAI. One site in Lordstown, Ohio, where SoftBank has broken ground, is on track to be operational next year. The second site in Milam County, Texas, will be developed with SB Energy, a SoftBank Group company. These two sites may scale to 1.5 gigawatts over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new sites will join the flagship Stargate campus in Abilene, Texas. Oracle began delivering Nvidia hardware to that site in June, and OpenAI has already begun training (building new models) and inference (running ChatGPT) using the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown of those announced Stargate sites so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abilene, Texas: Flagship campus, already operational with Nvidia GB200 racks, plus planned 600-megawatt expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shackelford County, Texas: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doña Ana County, New Mexico: New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midwest location (undisclosed): New Oracle-developed site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lordstown, Ohio: New SoftBank-developed site, operational next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milam County, Texas: New SoftBank/SB Energy site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The July agreement between OpenAI and Oracle to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate capacity represents a partnership worth over $300 billion between the two companies over five years. The companies say they selected the five new sites after reviewing over 300 proposals from more than 30 states in a nationwide process launched in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why OpenAI wants massive computing power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of numbers OpenAI and friends throw around—10 gigawatts here, $500 billion there—are somewhat staggering and mind-boggling in scope for the layperson who might not be familiar with the massive scale of Internet infrastructure. For example, ten gigawatts is equivalent to the output of roughly 10 nuclear reactors, which is enough electricity to power millions of homes. But what does OpenAI really need those data centers for? It all goes back to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's dream of providing intelligence as a service to billions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AI can only fulfill its promise if we build the compute to power it," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in the announcement. "That compute is the key to ensuring everyone can benefit from AI and to unlocking future breakthroughs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman's statement reflects optimism about the usefulness of future AI systems, but despite warnings of an AI bubble and criticism of the underlying technology, there is still actual unmet demand for generative AI capacity today. ChatGPT serves 700 million weekly active users, more than double the US population, who regularly use the AI assistant to develop software, provide personal advice, and compose or edit correspondence and reports. While the outputs may be imperfect at times, people apparently still want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI regularly faces severe capacity constraints to produce those outputs, which leads to limits on how often its users can query the chatbot. ChatGPT Plus subscribers frequently encounter these usage limits, particularly when using more compute-intensive features like image generation or simulated reasoning models. Free users, who represent a gateway for future subscriptions, face even stricter limitations. OpenAI lacks the computing capacity to meet current demand, let alone room for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Training next-generation AI models compounds the problem. On top of running existing AI models like those that power ChatGPT, OpenAI is constantly working on new technology in the background. It's a process that requires thousands of specialized chips running continuously for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The circular investment question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial structure of these deals between OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia has drawn scrutiny from industry observers. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion as OpenAI deploys Nvidia systems. As Bryn Talkington of Requisite Capital Management told CNBC: "Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle's arrangement follows a similar pattern, with a reported $30 billion-per-year deal where Oracle builds facilities that OpenAI pays to use. This circular flow, which involves infrastructure providers investing in AI companies that become their biggest customers, has raised eyebrows about whether these represent genuine economic investments or elaborate accounting maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangements are becoming even more convoluted. The Information reported this week that Nvidia is discussing leasing its chips to OpenAI rather than selling them outright. Under this structure, Nvidia would create a separate entity to purchase its own GPUs, then lease them to OpenAI, which adds yet another layer of circular financial engineering to this complicated relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand," wrote tech critic Ed Zitron on Bluesky last week about the unusual flow of AI infrastructure investments. Zitron was referring to companies like CoreWeave and Lambda Labs, which have raised billions in debt to buy Nvidia GPUs based partly on contracts from Nvidia itself. It's a pattern that mirrors OpenAI's arrangements with Oracle and Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens if the bubble pops? Even Altman himself warned last month that "someone will lose a phenomenal amount of money" in what he called an AI bubble. If AI demand fails to meet these astronomical projections, the massive data centers built on physical soil won't simply vanish. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, fiber optic cable laid during the boom years eventually found use as Internet demand caught up. Similarly, these facilities could potentially pivot to cloud services, scientific computing, or other workloads, but at what might be massive losses for investors who paid AI-boom prices.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

OpenAI lacks the computing capacity to meet current demand, let alone room for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training next-generation AI models compounds the problem. On top of running existing AI models like those that power ChatGPT, OpenAI is constantly working on new technology in the background. It's a process that requires thousands of specialized chips running continuously for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The circular investment question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial structure of these deals between OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia has drawn scrutiny from industry observers. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion as OpenAI deploys Nvidia systems. As Bryn Talkington of Requisite Capital Management told CNBC: "Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle's arrangement follows a similar pattern, with a reported $30 billion-per-year deal where Oracle builds facilities that OpenAI pays to use. This circular flow, which involves infrastructure providers investing in AI companies that become their biggest customers, has raised eyebrows about whether these represent genuine economic investments or elaborate accounting maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangements are becoming even more convoluted. The Information reported this week that Nvidia is discussing leasing its chips to OpenAI rather than selling them outright. Under this structure, Nvidia would create a separate entity to purchase its own GPUs, then lease them to OpenAI, which adds yet another layer of circular financial engineering to this complicated relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand," wrote tech critic Ed Zitron on Bluesky last week about the unusual flow of AI infrastructure investments. Zitron was referring to companies like CoreWeave and Lambda Labs, which have raised billions in debt to buy Nvidia GPUs based partly on contracts from Nvidia itself. It's a pattern that mirrors OpenAI's arrangements with Oracle and Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens if the bubble pops? Even Altman himself warned last month that "someone will lose a phenomenal amount of money" in what he called an AI bubble. If AI demand fails to meet these astronomical projections, the massive data centers built on physical soil won't simply vanish. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, fiber optic cable laid during the boom years eventually found use as Internet demand caught up. Similarly, these facilities could potentially pivot to cloud services, scientific computing, or other workloads, but at what might be massive losses for investors who paid AI-boom prices.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  
          &lt;div class="-mx-2.5 sm:mx-0"&gt;

The bill defines a “catastrophic risk” as a foreseeable, material risk that a foundation model’s development, storage, use, or deployment will result in death or serious injury to more than 50 people, or more than $1 billion in property damages arising from a single incident involving a foundation model:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing expert-level assistance in the creation or release of CBRN weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous cyberattack, murder, assault, extortion, or theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these risks in mind, SB-53 requires frontier developers to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish a frontier AI framework that includes (among other things) the developer’s capability thresholds for catastrophic risks, risk mitigations, and internal governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review and update the framework once a year, and publish modifications within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish transparency reports for each new frontier model, including technical specifications and catastrophic risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share assessments of catastrophic risks from internal use of frontier models with California’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) every 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refrain from lying about catastrophic risks from its frontier models, its management of catastrophic risks, or its compliance with its frontier AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident reporting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governments need to be alerted to critical safety incidents involving frontier AI systems—such as harms resulting from unauthorized access to model weights or loss of control of an agent—to intervene before they escalate into catastrophic outcomes. SB-53 provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OES will establish a hotline for reporting critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are required to report critical safety incidents to within 15 days, or 24 hours if there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the OES will produce a report with anonymized and aggregated information about critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill’s incident reporting requirements are also designed to accommodate future federal requirements. In the case that federal requirement for critical safety incident reporting becomes equivalent to, or stricter than, those required by SB-53, then OES can defer to those federal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower protection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;California state authorities will need to rely on whistleblowers to report whether frontier AI companies are complying with SB-53’s requirements. Given the industry’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-whistleblowers-ask-sec-investigate-restrictive-non-disclosure-agreements-2024-07-13/" rel="rel"&gt;mixed history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; regarding whistleblowers, the bill provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are prohibited from preventing or retaliating against covered employees (employees responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents) from reporting activities that they have reason to believe pose a specific and substantial catastrophic risk. (Existing whistleblower protections cover all employees and any violation of law—which includes SB-53’s transparency and incident-reporting requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Attorney General will publish a report with anonymized and aggregated information about reports from covered employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered employees can sue frontier developers for noncompliance with whistleblower protections, and the Attorney General is empowered to enforce the bill’s transparency and incident reporting requirements by punishing violations with civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here, and what happens next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; SB-1047 required frontier AI developers to implement specific controls to reduce catastrophic risk (such as shutdown controls and prohibitions on releasing unreasonably risky models), and Governor Newsom vetoed the bill under pressure from national Democratic leadership and industry lobbying. Since SB-53 only implements transparency requirements—and relies on the recommendations made by the Governor’s working group—SB-53 seems more likely to be signed into law. Anthropic has also publicly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/anthropic-bill-gavin-newsom-scott-wiener-00550029" rel="rel"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom has until October 12th to sign SB-53.

The bill defines a “catastrophic risk” as a foreseeable, material risk that a foundation model’s development, storage, use, or deployment will result in death or serious injury to more than 50 people, or more than $1 billion in property damages arising from a single incident involving a foundation model:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing expert-level assistance in the creation or release of CBRN weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous cyberattack, murder, assault, extortion, or theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these risks in mind, SB-53 requires frontier developers to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish a frontier AI framework that includes (among other things) the developer’s capability thresholds for catastrophic risks, risk mitigations, and internal governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review and update the framework once a year, and publish modifications within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish transparency reports for each new frontier model, including technical specifications and catastrophic risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share assessments of catastrophic risks from internal use of frontier models with California’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) every 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refrain from lying about catastrophic risks from its frontier models, its management of catastrophic risks, or its compliance with its frontier AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident reporting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governments need to be alerted to critical safety incidents involving frontier AI systems—such as harms resulting from unauthorized access to model weights or loss of control of an agent—to intervene before they escalate into catastrophic outcomes. SB-53 provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OES will establish a hotline for reporting critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are required to report critical safety incidents to within 15 days, or 24 hours if there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the OES will produce a report with anonymized and aggregated information about critical safety incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill’s incident reporting requirements are also designed to accommodate future federal requirements. In the case that federal requirement for critical safety incident reporting becomes equivalent to, or stricter than, those required by SB-53, then OES can defer to those federal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower protection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;California state authorities will need to rely on whistleblowers to report whether frontier AI companies are complying with SB-53’s requirements. Given the industry’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-whistleblowers-ask-sec-investigate-restrictive-non-disclosure-agreements-2024-07-13/" rel="rel"&gt;mixed history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; regarding whistleblowers, the bill provides that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier developers are prohibited from preventing or retaliating against covered employees (employees responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents) from reporting activities that they have reason to believe pose a specific and substantial catastrophic risk. (Existing whistleblower protections cover all employees and any violation of law—which includes SB-53’s transparency and incident-reporting requirements.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Attorney General will publish a report with anonymized and aggregated information about reports from covered employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered employees can sue frontier developers for noncompliance with whistleblower protections, and the Attorney General is empowered to enforce the bill’s transparency and incident reporting requirements by punishing violations with civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here, and what happens next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; SB-1047 required frontier AI developers to implement specific controls to reduce catastrophic risk (such as shutdown controls and prohibitions on releasing unreasonably risky models), and Governor Newsom vetoed the bill under pressure from national Democratic leadership and industry lobbying. Since SB-53 only implements transparency requirements—and relies on the recommendations made by the Governor’s working group—SB-53 seems more likely to be signed into law. Anthropic has also publicly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/anthropic-bill-gavin-newsom-scott-wiener-00550029" rel="rel"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governor Newsom has until October 12th to sign SB-53. If he does, SB-53 will be the first significant AI legislation to become law since Senator Ted Cruz pushed (and narrowly failed) to attach a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI enforcement to federal budget legislation.

That’s a huge jump from 73% just a year ago, showing just how fast retailers are scrambling to avoid being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this AI gold rush comes with a dark side. As organisations weave these tools into the fabric of their operations, they are creating a massive new surface for cyberattacks and sensitive data leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s findings show a sector in transition, moving from chaotic early adoption to a more controlled, corporate-led approach. There’s been a shift away from staff using their personal AI accounts, which has more than halved from 74% to 36% since the beginning of the year. In its place, usage of company-approved GenAI tools has more than doubled, climbing from 21% to 52% in the same timeframe. It’s a sign that businesses are waking up to the dangers of “shadow AI” and trying to get a handle on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the battle for the retail desktop, ChatGPT remains king, used by 81% of organisations. Yet, its dominance is not absolute. Google Gemini has made inroads with 60% adoption, and Microsoft’s Copilot tools are hot on its heels at 56% and 51% respectively. ChatGPT’s popularity has recently seen its first-ever dip, while Microsoft 365 Copilot’s usage has surged, likely thanks to its deep integration with the productivity tools many employees use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneath the surface of this generative AI adoption by the retail industry lies a growing security nightmare. The very thing that makes these tools useful – their ability to process information – is also their biggest weakness. Retailers are seeing alarming amounts of sensitive data being fed into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of data exposed is the company’s own source code, making up 47% of all data policy violations in GenAI apps. Close behind is regulated data, like confidential customer and business information, at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, a growing number of retailers are simply banning apps they deem too risky. The app most frequently finding itself on the blocklist is ZeroGPT, with 47% of organisations banning it over concerns it stores user content and has even been caught redirecting data to third-party sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newfound caution is pushing the retail industry towards more serious, enterprise-grade generative AI platforms from major cloud providers. These platforms offer far greater control, allowing companies to host models privately and build their own custom tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both OpenAI via Azure and Amazon Bedrock are tied for the lead, with each being used by 16% of retail companies. But these are no silver bullets; a simple misconfiguration could inadvertently connect a powerful AI directly to a company’s crown jewels, creating the potential for a catastrophic breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat isn’t just from employees using AI in their browsers. The report finds that 63% of organisations are now connecting directly to OpenAI’s API, embedding AI deep into their backend systems and automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This AI-specific risk is part of a wider, troubling pattern of poor cloud security hygiene. Attackers are increasingly using trusted names to deliver malware, knowing that an employee is more likely to click a link from a familiar service. Microsoft OneDrive is the most common culprit, with 11% of retailers hit by malware from the platform every month, while the developer hub GitHub is used in 9.7% of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing problem of employees using personal apps at work continues to pour fuel on the fire. Social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn are used in nearly every retail environment (96% and 94% respectively), alongside personal cloud storage accounts. It’s on these unapproved personal services that the worst data breaches happen. When employees upload files to personal apps, 76% of the resulting policy violations involve regulated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security leaders in retail, casual generative AI experimentation is over. Netskope’s findings are a warning that organisations must act decisively. It’s time to gain full visibility of all web traffic, block high-risk applications, and enforce strict data protection policies to control what information can be sent where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without adequate governance, the next innovation could easily become the next headline-making breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Frederik, Snowflake: Data quality is key to AI-driven growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for the AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo event series." class="wp-image-109137" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

That’s a huge jump from 73% just a year ago, showing just how fast retailers are scrambling to avoid being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this AI gold rush comes with a dark side. As organisations weave these tools into the fabric of their operations, they are creating a massive new surface for cyberattacks and sensitive data leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s findings show a sector in transition, moving from chaotic early adoption to a more controlled, corporate-led approach. There’s been a shift away from staff using their personal AI accounts, which has more than halved from 74% to 36% since the beginning of the year. In its place, usage of company-approved GenAI tools has more than doubled, climbing from 21% to 52% in the same timeframe.

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Vice President of Generative AI Software Kari Briski today joined Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Evan Solomon and Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere, in a special address moderated by SiriusXM host Amber Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re all here to deliver the next big thing,” Solomon told the room full of founders, researchers, investors and students. “The AI revolution is the birth not just of a new technology — this is the birth of the age of the entrepreneur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session comes as Canadian communications technology company and NVIDIA Cloud Partner TELUS announces the launch of Canada’s first fully sovereign AI factory in Rimouski, Quebec, powered by&amp;nbsp; the latest NVIDIA accelerated computing, and financial services company RBC Capital Markets continues building AI agents for capital markets using NVIDIA software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For our government, for our country, ‘All In’ means building digital sovereignty — the most pressing policy, democratic issue of our time,” Solomon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every nation should develop its own AI — not just outsource it,” Briski said during the panel conversation following Solomon’s address. “AI must reflect local values, understand cultural context and align with national norms and policies. It needs to speak and write in the nuanced patterns of your natural language. Digital intelligence isn’t something you can simply outsource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85262"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85262 size-large" height="1260" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9132-1680x1260.jpeg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85262"&gt;From left to right, Amber Mac, SiriusXM podcast host and moderator; Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at NVIDIA; Aiden Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere; Evan Solomon, Canada’s Minister of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s AI journey, bringing together public and private sector leaders to spotlight the national infrastructure, innovation and policy that shape the future of artificial intelligence. It underscores the country’s commitment to digital sovereignty, economic competitiveness and the responsible development of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Canada must own the tools and the rules that matter at this critical moment,” Solomon said. “We need our digital insurance policy — and that’s what we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s AI momentum is accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TELUS’ new facility, powered by NVIDIA’s computing and software, and built in collaboration with HPE, offers end-to-end AI capabilities — from model training to inferencing — while ensuring full data residency and control within Canadian borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory is already serving clients including OpenText, and is powered by 99% renewable energy and TELUS’ PureFibre network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accenture will develop and deploy industry-specific solutions on the TELUS sovereign AI platform, accelerating AI adoption across its Canadian clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And League, Canada’s leading healthcare consumer experience provider, will run its comprehensive suite of AI-powered healthcare solutions using the TELUS Sovereign AI Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is the latest in a global wave of initiatives as countries activate AI to supercharge their economies and research ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang has appeared at events in France, Germany, India, Japan and the U.K., joining heads of state and industry leaders to highlight national AI strategies, announce infrastructure investments and accelerate public-private collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leadership is not a birthright,” Solomon said. “It has to be earned again and again — and the competition is fierce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last year, during a visit to Canada, Huang highlighted Canada’s pioneering role in modern AI, describing it as the “epicenter of innovation in modern AI,” building on the foundational work of pioneering Canadian AI researchers such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who is also speaking at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RBC Capital Markets’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;work with NVIDIA software to build enterprise-grade AI agents for capital markets. This enables global institutions to deploy intelligent systems tailored to local needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These agents — customized with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA NeMo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; agent lifecycle tools and deployed using &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NVIDIA NIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; microservices — are helping transform RBC Capital Markets research for faster delivery of insights to clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets, TELUS and NVIDIA are sharing more on best practices for agentic AI development in a special session at All In on Wednesday from 4:15-5 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;

The August round was an oversubscribed $500 million round at a $6.8 billion valuation, the company said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere also announced an interesting twist on a partnership. While competitor OpenAI just nabbed an up-to $100 billion investment from the biggest GPU player, Nvidia, Cohere has signed a deal with AMD, which is one of its investors.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere’s full suite of Command-family AI models, including the Command vision, translate, and reasoning models, can now run on AMD’s Instinct GPU, a Nvidia GPU competitor. Moreover, AMD will be using Cohere internally as a customer. Cohere is not, however, abandoning support of Nvidia GPUs to strictly support AMD, the company tells TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere began as a front runner in the AI model race. It was co-founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “Transformer” paper that gave rise to the modern generative AI boom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI for instance, was reportedly valued at $500 billion last month while Anthropic hit an $183 billion valuation early this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent, aka keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Nexxus Capital Management (known for its Mexico and Iberia funds) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But, while a zero-to-$7 billion valuation in six years would have been awe inspiring a decade ago, Cohere has since been overshadowed by the blindingly fast rise of OpenAI and its closest competitor Anthropic. OpenAI for instance, was reportedly valued at $500 billion last month while Anthropic hit an $183 billion valuation early this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cohere, which has always focused on the enterprise market, is now marketing itself to enterprises where AI sovereignty is urgent, aka keeping local control of the data and models, rather than putting them in the hands of a foreign entity. To that end, Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Nexxus Capital Management (known for its Mexico and Iberia funds) were new investors in this fresh $100 million round, Cohere says.&lt;/p&gt;
