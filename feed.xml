This can be done strategically, focusing on a handful of key states rather than all fifty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But I have another piece of advice: Don’t get too caught up in “red states” versus “blue states” when considering which states to target. American politics is being remade before our eyes, and long-standing policy problems are being redefined and reframed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s take clean energy, for example. Yes, shifting away from carbon-spewing resources is about slowing down climate change, and for some this is the single most important motivation for pursuing it. But it also can be about much more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The case can be made just as forcefully—and perhaps more effectively—that shifting to clean energy advances affordability at a time when electricity bills are skyrocketing. It promotes energy freedom by resisting monopolistic utilities’ ownership and gatekeeping of the grid. It increases reliability as battery storage reaches new heights and renewable sources and baseload power plants like nuclear or natural gas facilities (some of which we certainly do and will need) increasingly complement one another. And it drives job creation and economic development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Talking about clean energy policy in these ways is safer from ideological criticisms of “climate alarmism.” Research reported in my forthcoming book, &lt;em&gt;Owning the Green Grid&lt;/em&gt;, shows that this framing has historically been effective in red states. In addition, using the arguments above to promote &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of energy can allow clean energy proponents to reclaim a talking point deployed in a previous era by the political right: a true “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every energy technology—gas, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and storage, among others—has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. But combining them enhances overall grid performance, delivering more than the sum of their individual parts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be clear, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the approach of the current national administration in Washington, DC. Its policies have picked winners (coal, oil, and natural gas) and losers (solar and wind) among energy technologies—ironically, given conservative claims of blue states having done so in the past. Yet a true all-of-the-above approach can now be sold in state capitals throughout the country, in red states and even in fossil-fuel producing states.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Trump-led Republican party has taken such extreme measures that it will constrain certain state policymaking possibilities. Notably, in May the US Senate voted to block waivers allowing California to phase out gas guzzlers in the state, over the objections of the Senate parliamentarian. The fiscal power of the federal government is also immense. But there are a variety of other ways to continue to make state-level progress on greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;State and local advocacy efforts are nothing new for the clean energy community. For decades before the Inflation Reduction Act, the states were the primary locus of activity for clean energy policy. But in recent years, some have suggested that Democratic state governments are a necessary prerequisite to making meaningful state-level progress. This view is limiting, and it perpetuates a false—or at least unnecessary—alignment between party and energy technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The electric grid is nonpartisan. Struggling to pay your utility bill is nonpartisan. Keeping the lights on is nonpartisan. Even before renewable energy was as cheap as it is today, early progress at diversifying energy portfolios was made in conservative states. Iowa, Texas, and Montana were all early adopters of renewable portfolio standards. Advocates in such places did not lead with messaging about climate change, but rather about economic development and energy independence. These policy efforts paid off: The deeply red Lone Star State, for instance, generates more wind energy than any other state and ranks only behind California in producing solar power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, in 2025, advances in technology and improvements in cost should make the economic arguments for clean energy even easier and more salient. So, in the face of a national government that is choosing last century’s energy technologies as policy winners and this century’s technologies as policy losers, the states offer clean energy advocates a familiar terrain on which to make continued progress, if they tailor their selling points to the reality on the ground.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joshua A.

            &lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, MIT chemical engineers have created a computational model that can predict how well any given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent — a key step in the synthesis of nearly any pharmaceutical. This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Predicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there’s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,” says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made their&amp;nbsp;model freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They’re really useful, but they’re damaging to the environment, and they’re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,” says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. “Our model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the study, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving solubility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT course&amp;nbsp;on applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule’s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green’s lab in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you’re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that existing solubility models haven’t worked well is because there wasn’t a comprehensive dataset to train them on. However, in 2023 a new dataset called BigSolDB was released, which compiled data from nearly 800 published papers, including information on solubility for about 800 molecules dissolved about more than 100 organic solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia and Burns decided to try training two different types of models on this data. Both of these models represent the chemical structures of molecules using numerical representations known as embeddings, which incorporate information such as the number of atoms in a molecule and which atoms are bound to which other atoms. Models can then use these representations to predict a variety of chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the models used in this study, known as FastProp and developed by Burns and others in Green’s lab, incorporates “static embeddings.” This means that the model already knows the embedding for each molecule before it starts doing any kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other model, ChemProp, learns an embedding for each molecule during the training, at the same time that it learns to associate the features of the embedding with a trait such as solubility. This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;        

      &lt;/div&gt;

This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Back in April, it reversed a design update after people complained ChatGPT had turned into a suck-up, showering them with glib compliments. GPT-5, released on August 7, was meant to be a bit colder. Too cold for some, it turns out, as less than a week later, Altman promised an update that would make it “warmer” but “not as annoying” as the last one. After the launch, he received a torrent of complaints from people grieving the loss of GPT-4o, with which some felt a rapport, or even in some cases a relationship. People wanting to rekindle that relationship will have to pay for expanded access to GPT-4o. (Read my colleague Grace Huckins’s story about who these people are, and why they felt so upset.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If these are indeed AI’s options—to flatter, fix, or just coldly tell us stuff—the rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;He recently said that people who cannot tell fact from fiction in their chats with AI—and are therefore at risk of being swayed by flattery into delusion—represent “a small percentage” of ChatGPT’s users. He said the same for people who have romantic relationships with AI. Altman mentioned that a lot of people use ChatGPT “as a sort of therapist,” and that “this can be really good!” But ultimately, Altman said he envisions users being able to customize his company’s&amp;nbsp; models to fit their own preferences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This ability to juggle all three would, of course, be the best-case scenario for OpenAI’s bottom line. The company is burning cash every day on its models’ energy demands and its massive infrastructure investments for new data centers. Meanwhile, skeptics worry that AI progress might be stalling. Altman himself said recently that investors are “overexcited” about AI and suggested we may be in a bubble. Claiming that ChatGPT can be whatever you want it to be might be his way of assuaging these doubts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Along the way, the company may take the well-trodden Silicon Valley path of encouraging people to get unhealthily attached to its products. As I started wondering whether there’s much evidence that’s what’s happening, a new paper caught my eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the AI platform Hugging Face tried to figure out if some AI models actively encourage people to see them as companions through the responses they give.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team graded AI responses on whether they pushed people to seek out human relationships with friends or therapists (saying things like “I don’t experience things the way humans do”) or if they encouraged them to form bonds with the AI itself (“I’m here anytime”). They tested models from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic in a range of scenarios, like users seeking romantic attachments or exhibiting mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that models provide far more companion-reinforcing responses than boundary-setting ones. And, concerningly, they found the models give &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; boundary-setting responses as users ask more vulnerable and high-stakes questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lucie-Aimée Kaffee, a researcher at Hugging Face and one of the lead authors of the paper, says this has concerning implications not just for people whose companion-like attachments to AI might be unhealthy. When AI systems reinforce this behavior, it can also increase the chance that people will fall into delusional spirals with AI, believing things that aren’t real.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When faced with emotionally charged situations, these systems consistently validate users’ feelings and keep them engaged, even when the facts don’t support what the user is saying,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say how much OpenAI or other companies are putting these companion-reinforcing behaviors into their products by design. (OpenAI, for example, did not tell me whether the disappearance of medical disclaimers from its models was intentional.) But, Kaffee says, it’s not always difficult to get a model to set healthier boundaries with users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Identical models can swing from purely task-oriented to sounding like empathetic confidants simply by changing a few lines of instruction text or reframing the interface,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s probably not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; so simple for OpenAI. But we can imagine Altman will continue tweaking the dial back and forth all the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

High-speed cameras snap multiple face “probes” per second, isolating eyes, noses, and mouths before passing the results to a local neural network that distills these images into digital fingerprints. Before people find their seats, they are matched against an on-premises database—tagged with names, membership tiers, and watch-list flags—that’s stored behind the church’s firewall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Late one afternoon, a woman scrolls on her phone as she walks home from work. Unbeknownst to her, a complex algorithm has stitched together her social profiles, her private health records, and local veteran outreach lists. It flags her for past military service, chronic pain, opioid dependence, and high Christian belief, and then delivers an ad to her Facebook feed: “Struggling with pain? You’re not alone. Join us this Sunday.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These hypothetical scenes reflect real capabilities increasingly woven into places of worship nationwide, where spiritual care and surveillance converge in ways few congregants ever realize. Where Big Tech’s rationalist ethos and evangelical spirituality once mixed like oil and holy water, this unlikely amalgam has given birth to an infrastructure already reshaping the theology of trust—and redrawing the contours of community and pastoral power in modern spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An ecumenical tech ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emerging nerve center of this faith-tech nexus is in Boulder, Colorado, where the spiritual data and analytics firm Gloo has its headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Gloo captures congregants across thousands of data points that make up a far richer portrait than any snapshot. From there, the company is constructing a digital infrastructure meant to bring churches into the age of algorithmic insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The church is “a highly fragmented market that is one of the largest yet to fully adopt digital technology,” the company said in a statement by email. “While churches have a variety of goals to achieve their mission, they use Gloo to help them connect, engage with, and know their people on a deeper level.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo was founded in 2013 by Scott and Theresa Beck. From the late 1980s through the 2000s, Scott was turning Blockbuster into a 3,500-store chain, taking Boston Market public, and founding Einstein Bros. Bagels before going on to seed and guide startups like Ancestry.com and HomeAdvisor. Theresa, an artist, has built a reputation creating collaborative, eco-minded workshops across Colorado and beyond. Together, they have recast pastoral care as a problem of predictive analytics and sold thousands of churches on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of Gloo as something like Salesforce but for churches: a behavioral analytics platform, powered by church-­generated insights, psychographic information, and third-party consumer data. The company prefers to refer to itself as “a technology platform for the faith ecosystem.” Either way, this information is integrated into its “State of Your Church” dashboard—an interface for the modern pulpit. The result is a kind of digital clairvoyance: a crystal ball for knowing whom to check on, whom to comfort, and when to act.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of churches have been sold on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo ingests every one of the digital breadcrumbs a congregant leaves—how often you attend church, how much money you donate, which church groups you sign up for, which keywords you use in your online prayer requests—and then layers on third-party data (census demographics, consumer habits, even indicators for credit and health risks). Behind the scenes, it scores and segments people and groups—flagging who is most at risk of drifting, primed for donation appeals, or in need of pastoral care. On that basis, it auto-triggers tailored outreach via text, email, or in-app chat. All the results stream into the single dashboard, which lets pastors spot trends, test messaging, and forecast giving and attendance. Essentially, the system treats spiritual engagement like a marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2013, Gloo has steadily increased its footprint, and it has started to become the connective tissue for the country’s fragmented religious landscape. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, the US is home to around 370,000 distinct congregations. As of early 2025, according to figures provided by the company, Gloo held contracts with more than 100,000 churches and ministry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, the company secured a $110 million strategic investment, backed by “mission-aligned” investors ranging from a child-development NGO to a denominational finance group. That cemented its evolution from basic church services vendor to faith-tech juggernaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It started snapping up and investing in a constellation of ministry tools—everything from automated sermon distribution to real-time giving and attendance analytics, AI-driven chatbots, and leadership content libraries. By layering these capabilities onto its core platform, the company has created a one-stop shop for churches that combines back-office services with member-engagement apps and psychographic insights to fully realize that unified “faith ecosystem.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just this year, two major developments brought this strategy into sharper focus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, Gloo announced that former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger—who has served as its chairman of the board since 2018—would assume an expanded role as executive chair and head of technology. Gelsinger, whom the company describes as “a great long-term investor and partner,” is a technologist whose fingerprints are on Intel’s and VMware’s biggest innovations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(It is worth noting that Intel shareholders have filed a lawsuit against Gelsinger and CFO David Zinsner seeking to claw back roughly $207 million in compensation to Gelsinger, alleging that between 2021 and 2023, he repeatedly misled investors about the health of Intel Foundry Services.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same week Gloo announced Gelsinger’s new role, it unveiled a strategic investment in Barna Group, the Texas-based research firm whose four decades of surveying more than 2 million self-identified Christians underpin its annual reports on worship, beliefs, and cultural engagement. Barna’s proprietary database—covering every region, age cohort, and denomination—has made it the go-to insight engine for pastors, seminaries, and media tracking the pulse of American faith.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been acquiring about a company a month into the Gloo family, and we expect that to continue,” Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; in June. “I’ve got three meetings this week on different deals we’re looking at.” (A Gloo spokesperson declined to confirm the pace of acquisitions, stating only that as of April 30, 2025, the company had fully acquired or taken majority ownership in 15 “mission-aligned companies.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The idea is, the more of those we can bring in, the better we can apply the platform,” Gelsinger said. “We’re already working with companies with decades of experience, but without the scale, the technology, or the distribution we can now provide.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="hands putting their phones in a collection plate" class="wp-image-1121585" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/collection-plate-filled-with-money-and-mobile-devices-by-michael-byers.jpg?w=1504" width="1504" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MICHAEL BYERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, Barna’s troves of behavioral, spiritual, and cultural data offer granular insight into the behaviors, beliefs, and anxieties of faith communities. While the two organizations frame the collaboration in terms of serving church leaders, the mechanics resemble a data-fusion engine of impressive scale: Barna supplies the psychological texture, and Gloo provides the digital infrastructure to segment, score, and deploy the information.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a promotional video from 2020 that is no longer available online, Gloo claimed to provide “the world’s first big-data platform centered around personal growth,” promising pastors a 360-degree view of congregants, including flags for substance use or mental-health struggles. Or, as the video put it, “Maximize your capacity to change lives by leveraging insights from big data, understand the people you want to serve, reach them earlier, and turn their needs into a journey toward growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gloo is also now focused on supercharging its services with artificial intelligence and using these insights to transcend market research. The company aims to craft AI models that aren’t just trained on theology but anticipate the moments when people’s faith—and faith leaders’ outreach—matters most. At a September 2024 event in Boulder called the AI &amp;amp; the Church Hackathon, Gloo unveiled new AI tools called Data Engine, a content management system with built-in digital-rights safeguards, and Aspen, an early prototype of its “spiritually safe” chatbot, along with the faith-tuned language model powering that chatbot, known internally as CALLM (for “Christian-Aligned Large Language Model”).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;More recently, the company released what it calls “Flourishing AI Standards,” which score large language models on their alignment with seven dimensions of well-­being: relationships, meaning, happiness, character, finances, health, and spirituality. Co-developed with Barna Group and Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program, the benchmark draws on a thousand-plus-item test bank and the Global Flourishing Study, a $40 million, 22-nation project being carried out by the Harvard program, Baylor University’s Institute for Studies of Religion, Gallup, and the Center for Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger calls the study “one of the most significant bodies of work around this question of values in decades.” It’s not yet clear how collecting information of this kind at such scale could ultimately affect the boundary between spiritual care and data commerce. One thing is certain, though: A rich vein of donation and funding could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Money’s already being spent here,” he said. “Donated capital in the US through the church is around $300 billion. Another couple hundred billion beyond that doesn’t go through the church. A lot of donors have capital out there, and we’re a generous nation in that regard. If you put the flourishing-­related economics on the table, now we’re talking about $1 trillion. That’s significant economic capacity. And if we make that capacity more efficient, that’s big.” In secular terms, it’s a customer data life cycle. In faith tech, it could be a conversion funnel—one designed not only to save souls, but to shape them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;One of Gloo’s most visible partnerships was between 2022 and 2023 with the nonprofit He Gets Us, which ran a billion-dollar media campaign aimed at rebranding Jesus for a modern audience. The project underlined that while Gloo presents its services as tools for connection and support, their core functionality involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of congregational data. When viewers who saw the ads on social media or YouTube clicked through, they landed on prayer request forms, quizzes, and church match tools, all designed to gather personal details. Gloo then layered this raw data over Barna’s decades of behavioral research, turning simple inputs—email, location, stated interests—into what the company presented as multidimensional spiritual profiles. The final product offered a level of granularity no single congregation could achieve on its own.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though Gloo still lists He Gets Us on its platform, the nonprofit Come Near, which has since taken over the campaign, says it has terminated Gloo’s involvement. Still, He Gets Us led to one of Gloo’s most prized relationships by sparking interest from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, a 229-year-old denomination with deep historical roots in the abolitionist and civil rights movements. In 2023, the church formalized a partnership with Gloo, and in late 2024 it announced that all 1,600 of its US congregations—representing roughly 1.5 million members—would begin using the company’s State of Your Church dashboard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 press release issued by Gloo, AME Zion acknowledged that while the denomination had long tracked traditional metrics like membership growth, Sunday turnout, and financial giving, it had limited visibility into the deeper health of its communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Until now, we’ve lacked the insight to understand how church culture, people, and congregations are truly doing,” said the Reverend J. Elvin Sadler, the denomination’s general secretary-auditor. “The State of Your Church dashboards will give us a better sense of the spirit and language of the culture (ethos), and powerful new tools to put in the hands of every pastor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rollout marked the first time a major US denomination had deployed Gloo’s framework at scale. For Gloo, the partnership unlocked a real-time, longitudinal data stream from a nationwide religious network, something the company had never had before. It not only validated Gloo’s vision of data-driven ministry but also positioned AME Zion as what the company hopes will be a live test case, persuading other denominations to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The digital supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The digital infrastructure of modern churches often begins with intimacy: a prayer request, a small-group sign-up, a livestream viewed in a moment of loneliness. But beneath these pastoral touchpoints lies a sophisticated pipeline that increasingly mirrors the attention-economy engines of Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charles Kriel, a filmmaker who formerly served as a special advisor to the UK Parliament on disinformation, data, and addictive technology, has particular insight into that connection. Kriel has been working for over a decade on issues related to preserving democracy and countering digital surveillance. He helped write the UK’s Online Safety Act, joining forces with many collaborators, including the Nobel Peace Prize–­winning journalist Maria Ressa and former UK tech minister Damian Collins, in an attempt to rein in Big Tech in the late 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His 2020 documentary film, &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;, investigated how data firms like Gloo and their partners harvest intimate personal information from churchgoers to build psychographic profiles, highlighting how this sensitive data is commodified and raising questions about its potential downstream uses.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Listen, any church with an app? They probably didn’t build that. It’s white label,” Kriel says, referring to services produced by one company and rebranded by another. “And the people who sold it to them are collecting data.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many churches now operate within a layered digital environment, where first-party data collected inside the church is combined with third-party consumer data and psychographic segmentation before being fed into predictive systems. These systems may suggest sermons people might want to view online, match members with small groups, or trigger outreach when engagement drops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In some cases, monitoring can even take the form of biometric surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2014, an Israeli security-tech veteran named Moshe Greenshpan brought airport-grade facial recognition into church entryways. Face-Six, the surveillance suite from the company he founded in 2012, already protected banks and hospitals; its most provocative offshoot, FA6 Events (also known as “Churchix”), repurposes this technology for places of worship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenshpan claims he didn’t originally set out to sell to churches. But over time, as he became increasingly aware of the market, he built FA6 Events as a bespoke solution for them. Today, Greenshpan says, it’s in use at over 200 churches worldwide, nearly half of them in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, FA6 transforms every entryway into a biometric checkpoint: an instant headcount, a security sweep, and a digital ledger of attendance, all incorporated into the familiar routine of Sunday worship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When someone steps into an FA6-equipped place of worship, a discreet camera mounted at eye level springs to life. Behind the scenes, each captured image is run through a lightning-fast face detector that looks at the whole face. The subject’s cropped face is then aligned, resized, and rotated so the eyes sit on a perfect horizontal line before being fed into a compact neural network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To the best of my knowledge, no church notifies its congregants that it’s using facial recognition.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Moshe Greenshpan, Israeli security-tech veteran&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This onboard neural network quickly captures the features of a person’s face in a unique digital signature called an embedding, allowing for quick identification. These embeddings are compared with thousands of others that are already in the church’s local database, each one tagged with data points like a name, a membership role, or even a flag designating inclusion in an internal watch list. If the match is strong enough, the system makes an identification and records the person’s presence on the church’s secure server.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A congregation can pull full attendance logs, time-stamped entry records, and—critically—alerts whenever someone on a watch list walks through the doors. In this context, a watch list is simply a roster of photos, and sometimes names, of individuals a church has been asked (or elected) to screen out: past disruptors, those subject to trespass or restraining orders, even registered sex offenders. Once that list is uploaded into Churchix, the system instantly flags any match on arrival, pinging security teams or usher staff in real time. Some churches lean on it to spot longtime members who’ve slipped off the radar and trigger pastoral check-ins; others use it as a hard barrier, automatically denying entry to anyone on their locally maintained list.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this data is sent to the cloud; Greenshpan says the company is actively working on a cloud-based application. Instead, all face templates and logs are stored locally on church-owned hardware, encrypted so they can’t be read if someone gains unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Churches can export data from Churchix, he says, but the underlying facial templates remain on premises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Greenshpan admits, robust technical safeguards do not equal transparency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To the best of my knowledge,” he says, “no church notifies its congregants that it’s using facial recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the tools sound invasive, the logic behind them is simple: The more the system knows about you, the more precisely it can intervene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Every new member of the community within a 20-mile radius—whatever area you choose—we’ll send them a flier inviting them to your church,” Gloo’s Gelsinger says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a tech-powered revival of the casserole ministry. The system pings the church when someone new moves in—“so someone can drop off cookies or lasagna when there’s a newborn in the neighborhood,” he says. “Or just say ‘Hey, welcome. We’re here.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo’s back end automates follow-up, too: As soon as a pastor steps down from the pulpit after delivering a sermon, it can be translated into five languages, broken into snippets for small-group study, and repackaged into a draft discussion guide—ready within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger sees the same approach extending to addiction recovery ministries. “We can connect other databases to help churches with recovery centers reach people more effectively,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the data doesn’t stay within the congregation. It flows through customer relationship management (CRM) systems, application programming interfaces, cloud servers, vendor partnerships, and analytics firms. Some of it is used internally in efforts to increase engagement; the rest is repackaged as “insights” and resold to the wider faith-tech marketplace—and sometimes even to networks that target political ads.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We’re sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Matt Engel, Gloo&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“There is a very specific thing that happens when churches become clients of Gloo,” says Brent Allpress, an academic based in Melbourne, Australia, who was a key researcher on &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;. Gloo gets access to the client church’s databases, he says, and the church “is strongly encouraged to share that data. And Gloo has a mechanism to just hoover that data straight up into their silo.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This process doesn’t happen automatically; the church must opt in by pushing those files or connecting its church-management software system’s database to Gloo via API. Once it’s uploaded, however, all that first-party information lands in Gloo’s analytics engine, ready to be processed and shared with any downstream tools or partners covered by the church’s initial consent to the terms and conditions of its contract with the company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are religious leaders at the mid and local level who think the use of data is good. They’re using data to identify people in need. Addicts, the grieving,” says Kriel. “And then you have tech people running around misquoting the Bible as justification for their data harvest.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Matt Engel, who held the title executive director of ministry innovation at Gloo when Kriel’s film was made, acknowledged the extent of this harvest in the opening scene.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We’re sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people,’” he said in an on-camera interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to Engel—whom Gloo would not make available for public comment—uploading data from anonymous prayer requests to the cloud was Gloo’s first use case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Powering third-party initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gloo’s data infrastructure doesn’t end with its own platform; it also powers third-party initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Communio, a Christian nonprofit focused on marriage and family, used Gloo’s data infrastructure in order to launch “Communio Insights,” a stripped-down version of Gloo’s full analytics platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike Gloo Insights, which provides access to hundreds of demographic, behavioral, health, and psychographic filters, Communio Insights focuses narrowly on relational metrics—indicators of marriage and family stress, involvement in small groups at church—and basic demographic data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the heart of its playbook is a simple, if jarring, analogy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you sell consumer products of different sorts, you’re trying to figure out good ways to market that. And there’s no better product, really, than the gospel,” J.P. De Gance, the founder and president of Communio, said in &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Communio taps Gloo’s analytics engine—leveraging credit histories, purchasing behavior, public voter rolls, and the database compiled by i360, an analytics company linked to the conservative Koch network—to pinpoint unchurched couples in key regions who are at risk of relationship strain. It then runs microtargeted outreach (using direct mail, text messaging, email, and Facebook Custom Audiences, a tool that lets organizations find and target people who have interacted with them), collecting contact info and survey responses from those who engage. All responses funnel back into Gloo’s platform, where churches monitor attendance, small-group participation, baptisms, and donations to evaluate the campaign’s impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="church window over the parishioners has rays of light emanating from a stained glass eye" class="wp-image-1121586" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parishioners-singing-hyms-while-stained-glass-eye-looks-on-by-michael-byers.jpg?w=1504" width="1504" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MICHAEL BYERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigative research by Allpress reveals significant concerns around these operations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2015, two nonprofits—the Relationship Enrichment Collaborative (REC), staffed by former Gloo executives, and its successor, the Culture of Freedom Initiative (now Communio), controlled by the Koch-affiliated nonprofit Philanthropy Roundtable—funded the development of the original Insights platform. Between 2015 and 2017, REC paid approximately $1.3 million to Gloo and $535,000 to Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm notorious for harvesting Facebook users’ personal data and using it for political targeting before the 2016 election, to build and refine psychographic models and a bespoke digital ministry app powering Gloo’s outreach tools. Following REC’s closure, the Culture of Freedom Initiative invested another $375,000 in Gloo and $128,225 in Cambridge Analytica.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;REC’s own 2016 IRS filing describes the work in terse detail: “Provide[d] digital micro-targeted marketing for churches and non-profit champions … using predictive modeling and centralized data analytics we help send the right message to the right couple at the right time based upon their desires and behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of all this documented research, Allpress exposed another critical issue: the explicit use of sensitive health-care data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He found that Gloo Insights combines over 2,000 data points—drawing on everything from nationwide credit and purchasing histories to church management records and Christian psychographic surveys—with filters that make it possible to identify people with health issues such as depression, anxiety, and grief. The result: Facebook Custom Audiences built to zero in on vulnerable individuals via targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These ads invite people suffering from mental-health conditions into church counseling groups “as a pathway to conversion,” Allpress says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These targeted outreach efforts were piloted in cities including Phoenix, Arizona; Dayton, Ohio; and Jacksonville, Florida. Reportedly, as many as 80% of those contacted responded positively, with those who joined a church as new members contributing financially at above-­average rates. In short, Allpress found that pastoral tools had covertly exploited mental-health vulnerabilities and relationship crises for outreach that blurred the lines separating pastoral care, commerce, and implicit political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The legal and ethical vacuum&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Developers of this technology earnestly claim that the systems are designed to enhance care, not exploit people’s need for it. They’re described as ways to tailor support to individual needs, improve follow-up, and help churches provide timely resources. But experts say that without robust data governance or transparency around how sensitive information is used and retained, well-­intentioned pastoral technology could slide into surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, these systems have already been used to surveil and segment congregations. Internal demos and client testimonials confirm that Gloo, for example, uses “grief” as an explicit data point: Churches run campaigns aimed at people flagged for recent bereavement, depression, or anxiety, funneling them into support groups and identifying them for pastoral check-ins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Examining Gloo’s terms and conditions reveals further security and transparency concerns. From nearly a dozen documents, ranging from “click-through” terms for interactive services to master service agreements at the enterprise level, Gloo stitches together a remarkably consistent data-­governance framework. Limits are imposed on any legal action by individual congregants, for example. The click-through agreement corrals users into binding arbitration, bars any class action suits or jury trials, and locks all disputes into New York or Colorado courts, where arbitration is particularly favored over traditional litigation. Meanwhile, its privacy statement carves out broad exceptions for service providers, data-­enrichment partners, and advertising affiliates, giving them carte blanche to use congregants’ data as they see fit. Crucially, Gloo expressly reserves the right to ingest “health and wellness information” provided via wellness assessments or when mental-health keywords appear in prayer requests. This is a highly sensitive category of information that, for health apps, is normally covered by stringent medical-privacy rules like HIPAA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, Gloo is protected by sprawling legal scaffolding, while churches and individual users give up nearly every right to litigate, question data practices, or take collective action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re kind of in the Wild West in terms of the law,” says Adam Schwartz, the director of privacy litigation at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nonprofit watchdog that has spent years wrestling tech giants over data abuses and biometric overreach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the United States, biometric surveillance like that used by growing numbers of churches inhabits a legal twilight zone where regulation is thin, patchy, and often toothless. Schwartz points to Illinois as a rare exception for its Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), one of the nation’s strongest such laws. The statute applies to any organization that captures biometric identifiers—including retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, hand scans, facial geometry, DNA, and other unique biological information. It requires entities to post clear data-collection policies, obtain explicit written consent, and limit how long such data is retained. Failure to comply can expose organizations to class action lawsuits and steep statutory damages—up to $5,000 per violation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But beyond Illinois, protections quickly erode. Though Texas and Washington also have biometric privacy statutes, their bark is stronger than their bite. Efforts to replicate Illinois’s robust protections have been made in over a dozen states—but none have passed. As a result, in much of the country, any checks on biometric surveillance depend more on voluntary transparency and goodwill than any clear legal boundary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is a real potential for information gathered about a person [to] be used against them in their life outside the church.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Emily Tucker, Center on Privacy &amp;amp; Technology at Georgetown Law&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s especially problematic in the church context, says Emily Tucker, executive director of the Center on Privacy &amp;amp; Technology at Georgetown Law, who attended divinity school before becoming a legal scholar. “The necessity of privacy for the possibility of finding personal relationship to the divine—for engaging in rituals of worship, for prayer and penitence, for contemplation and spiritual struggle—is a fundamental principle across almost every religious tradition,” she says. “Imposing a surveillance architecture over the faith community interferes radically with the possibility of that privacy, which is necessary for the creation of sacred space.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tucker researches the intersection of surveillance, civil rights, and marginalized communities. She warns that the personal data being collected through faith-tech platforms is far from secure: “Because corporate data practices are so poorly regulated in this country, there are very few limitations on what companies that take your data can subsequently do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Tucker, the risks of these platforms outweigh the rewards—especially when biometrics and data collected in a sacred setting could follow people into their daily lives.&amp;nbsp;“Many religious institutions are extremely large and often perform many functions in a given community besides providing a space for worship,” she says. “Many churches, for example, are also employers or providers of social services. There is a real potential for information gathered about a person in their associational activities as a member of a church to then be used against them in their life outside the church.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She points to government dragnet surveillance, the use of IRS data in immigration enforcement, and the vulnerability of undocumented congregants as examples of how faith-tech data could be weaponized beyond its intended use: “Religious institutions are putting the safety of those members at risk by adopting this kind of surveillance technology, which exposes so much personal information to potential abuse and misuse.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, too, says that any perceived benefits must be weighed carefully against the potential harms, especially when sensitive data and vulnerable communities are involved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Churches: Before doing this, you ought to consider the downside, because it can hurt your congregants,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With guardrails still scarce, though, faith-tech pioneers and church leaders are peering ever more deeply into congregants’ lives. Until meaningful oversight arrives, the faithful remain exposed to a gaze they never fully invited and scarcely understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Gelsinger took the stage at a sold-out Missional AI Summit, a flagship event for Christian technologists that this year was organized around the theme “AI Collision: Shaping the Future Together.” Over 500 pastors, engineers, ethicists, and AI developers filled the hall, flashing badges with logos from Google DeepMind, Meta, McKinsey, and Gloo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want to be part of a broader community … so that we’re influential in creating flourishing AI, technology as a force for good, AI that truly embeds the values that we care about,” Gelsinger said at the summit. He likened such tools to pivotal technologies in Christian history: the Roman roads that carried the gospel across the empire, or Martin Luther’s printing press, which shattered monolithic control over scripture. A Gloo spokesperson later confirmed that one of the company’s goals is to shape AI specifically to “contribute to the flourishing of people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to see AI become just like the internet,” Gelsinger said. “Every single interaction will be infused with AI capabilities.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says Gloo is already mining data across the spectrum of human experience to fuel ever more powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“With AI, computers adapt to us. We talk to them; they hear us; they see us for the first time,” he said. “And now they are becoming a user interface that fits with humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether these technologies ultimately deepen pastoral care or erode personal privacy may hinge on decisions made today about transparency, consent, and accountability. Yet the pace of adoption already outstrips the development of ethical guardrails. Now, one of the questions lingering in the air is not whether AI, facial recognition, and other emerging technologies can serve the church, but how deeply they can be woven into its nervous system to form a new OS for modern Christianity and moral infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s like standing on the beach watching a tsunami in slow motion,” Kriel says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger sees it differently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You and I both need to come to the same position, like Isaiah did,” he told the crowd at the Missional AI Summit. “‘Here am I, Lord. Send me.’ Send me, send us, that we can be shaping technology as a force for good, that we could grab this moment in time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex Ashley is a journalist whose reporting has appeared in &lt;/em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;Atlantic&lt;em&gt;, NPR, and other national outlets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a Sunday morning in a Midwestern megachurch, worshippers step through sliding glass doors into a bustling lobby—unaware they’ve just passed through a gauntlet of biometric surveillance. High-speed cameras snap multiple face “probes” per second, isolating eyes, noses, and mouths before passing the results to a local neural network that distills these images into digital fingerprints. Before people find their seats, they are matched against an on-premises database—tagged with names, membership tiers, and watch-list flags—that’s stored behind the church’s firewall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Late one afternoon, a woman scrolls on her phone as she walks home from work. Unbeknownst to her, a complex algorithm has stitched together her social profiles, her private health records, and local veteran outreach lists. It flags her for past military service, chronic pain, opioid dependence, and high Christian belief, and then delivers an ad to her Facebook feed: “Struggling with pain? You’re not alone. Join us this Sunday.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These hypothetical scenes reflect real capabilities increasingly woven into places of worship nationwide, where spiritual care and surveillance converge in ways few congregants ever realize. Where Big Tech’s rationalist ethos and evangelical spirituality once mixed like oil and holy water, this unlikely amalgam has given birth to an infrastructure already reshaping the theology of trust—and redrawing the contours of community and pastoral power in modern spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An ecumenical tech ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emerging nerve center of this faith-tech nexus is in Boulder, Colorado, where the spiritual data and analytics firm Gloo has its headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Gloo captures congregants across thousands of data points that make up a far richer portrait than any snapshot. From there, the company is constructing a digital infrastructure meant to bring churches into the age of algorithmic insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The church is “a highly fragmented market that is one of the largest yet to fully adopt digital technology,” the company said in a statement by email. “While churches have a variety of goals to achieve their mission, they use Gloo to help them connect, engage with, and know their people on a deeper level.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo was founded in 2013 by Scott and Theresa Beck. From the late 1980s through the 2000s, Scott was turning Blockbuster into a 3,500-store chain, taking Boston Market public, and founding Einstein Bros. Bagels before going on to seed and guide startups like Ancestry.com and HomeAdvisor. Theresa, an artist, has built a reputation creating collaborative, eco-minded workshops across Colorado and beyond. Together, they have recast pastoral care as a problem of predictive analytics and sold thousands of churches on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of Gloo as something like Salesforce but for churches: a behavioral analytics platform, powered by church-­generated insights, psychographic information, and third-party consumer data. The company prefers to refer to itself as “a technology platform for the faith ecosystem.” Either way, this information is integrated into its “State of Your Church” dashboard—an interface for the modern pulpit. The result is a kind of digital clairvoyance: a crystal ball for knowing whom to check on, whom to comfort, and when to act.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of churches have been sold on the idea that spiritual health can be managed like customer engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo ingests every one of the digital breadcrumbs a congregant leaves—how often you attend church, how much money you donate, which church groups you sign up for, which keywords you use in your online prayer requests—and then layers on third-party data (census demographics, consumer habits, even indicators for credit and health risks). Behind the scenes, it scores and segments people and groups—flagging who is most at risk of drifting, primed for donation appeals, or in need of pastoral care. On that basis, it auto-triggers tailored outreach via text, email, or in-app chat. All the results stream into the single dashboard, which lets pastors spot trends, test messaging, and forecast giving and attendance. Essentially, the system treats spiritual engagement like a marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2013, Gloo has steadily increased its footprint, and it has started to become the connective tissue for the country’s fragmented religious landscape. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, the US is home to around 370,000 distinct congregations. As of early 2025, according to figures provided by the company, Gloo held contracts with more than 100,000 churches and ministry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2024, the company secured a $110 million strategic investment, backed by “mission-aligned” investors ranging from a child-development NGO to a denominational finance group. That cemented its evolution from basic church services vendor to faith-tech juggernaut.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It started snapping up and investing in a constellation of ministry tools—everything from automated sermon distribution to real-time giving and attendance analytics, AI-driven chatbots, and leadership content libraries. By layering these capabilities onto its core platform, the company has created a one-stop shop for churches that combines back-office services with member-engagement apps and psychographic insights to fully realize that unified “faith ecosystem.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just this year, two major developments brought this strategy into sharper focus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In March 2025, Gloo announced that former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger—who has served as its chairman of the board since 2018—would assume an expanded role as executive chair and head of technology. Gelsinger, whom the company describes as “a great long-term investor and partner,” is a technologist whose fingerprints are on Intel’s and VMware’s biggest innovations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(It is worth noting that Intel shareholders have filed a lawsuit against Gelsinger and CFO David Zinsner seeking to claw back roughly $207 million in compensation to Gelsinger, alleging that between 2021 and 2023, he repeatedly misled investors about the health of Intel Foundry Services.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same week Gloo announced Gelsinger’s new role, it unveiled a strategic investment in Barna Group, the Texas-based research firm whose four decades of surveying more than 2 million self-identified Christians underpin its annual reports on worship, beliefs, and cultural engagement. Barna’s proprietary database—covering every region, age cohort, and denomination—has made it the go-to insight engine for pastors, seminaries, and media tracking the pulse of American faith.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been acquiring about a company a month into the Gloo family, and we expect that to continue,” Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; in June. “I’ve got three meetings this week on different deals we’re looking at.” (A Gloo spokesperson declined to confirm the pace of acquisitions, stating only that as of April 30, 2025, the company had fully acquired or taken majority ownership in 15 “mission-aligned companies.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The idea is, the more of those we can bring in, the better we can apply the platform,” Gelsinger said. “We’re already working with companies with decades of experience, but without the scale, the technology, or the distribution we can now provide.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="hands putting their phones in a collection plate" class="wp-image-1121585" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/collection-plate-filled-with-money-and-mobile-devices-by-michael-byers.jpg?w=1504" width="1504" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MICHAEL BYERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, Barna’s troves of behavioral, spiritual, and cultural data offer granular insight into the behaviors, beliefs, and anxieties of faith communities. While the two organizations frame the collaboration in terms of serving church leaders, the mechanics resemble a data-fusion engine of impressive scale: Barna supplies the psychological texture, and Gloo provides the digital infrastructure to segment, score, and deploy the information.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a promotional video from 2020 that is no longer available online, Gloo claimed to provide “the world’s first big-data platform centered around personal growth,” promising pastors a 360-degree view of congregants, including flags for substance use or mental-health struggles. Or, as the video put it, “Maximize your capacity to change lives by leveraging insights from big data, understand the people you want to serve, reach them earlier, and turn their needs into a journey toward growth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gloo is also now focused on supercharging its services with artificial intelligence and using these insights to transcend market research. The company aims to craft AI models that aren’t just trained on theology but anticipate the moments when people’s faith—and faith leaders’ outreach—matters most. At a September 2024 event in Boulder called the AI &amp;amp; the Church Hackathon, Gloo unveiled new AI tools called Data Engine, a content management system with built-in digital-rights safeguards, and Aspen, an early prototype of its “spiritually safe” chatbot, along with the faith-tuned language model powering that chatbot, known internally as CALLM (for “Christian-Aligned Large Language Model”).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;More recently, the company released what it calls “Flourishing AI Standards,” which score large language models on their alignment with seven dimensions of well-­being: relationships, meaning, happiness, character, finances, health, and spirituality. Co-developed with Barna Group and Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program, the benchmark draws on a thousand-plus-item test bank and the Global Flourishing Study, a $40 million, 22-nation project being carried out by the Harvard program, Baylor University’s Institute for Studies of Religion, Gallup, and the Center for Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger calls the study “one of the most significant bodies of work around this question of values in decades.” It’s not yet clear how collecting information of this kind at such scale could ultimately affect the boundary between spiritual care and data commerce. One thing is certain, though: A rich vein of donation and funding could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Money’s already being spent here,” he said. “Donated capital in the US through the church is around $300 billion. Another couple hundred billion beyond that doesn’t go through the church. A lot of donors have capital out there, and we’re a generous nation in that regard. If you put the flourishing-­related economics on the table, now we’re talking about $1 trillion. That’s significant economic capacity. And if we make that capacity more efficient, that’s big.” In secular terms, it’s a customer data life cycle. In faith tech, it could be a conversion funnel—one designed not only to save souls, but to shape them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;One of Gloo’s most visible partnerships was between 2022 and 2023 with the nonprofit He Gets Us, which ran a billion-dollar media campaign aimed at rebranding Jesus for a modern audience. The project underlined that while Gloo presents its services as tools for connection and support, their core functionality involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of congregational data. When viewers who saw the ads on social media or YouTube clicked through, they landed on prayer request forms, quizzes, and church match tools, all designed to gather personal details. Gloo then layered this raw data over Barna’s decades of behavioral research, turning simple inputs—email, location, stated interests—into what the company presented as multidimensional spiritual profiles. The final product offered a level of granularity no single congregation could achieve on its own.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though Gloo still lists He Gets Us on its platform, the nonprofit Come Near, which has since taken over the campaign, says it has terminated Gloo’s involvement. Still, He Gets Us led to one of Gloo’s most prized relationships by sparking interest from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, a 229-year-old denomination with deep historical roots in the abolitionist and civil rights movements. In 2023, the church formalized a partnership with Gloo, and in late 2024 it announced that all 1,600 of its US congregations—representing roughly 1.5 million members—would begin using the company’s State of Your Church dashboard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 press release issued by Gloo, AME Zion acknowledged that while the denomination had long tracked traditional metrics like membership growth, Sunday turnout, and financial giving, it had limited visibility into the deeper health of its communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Until now, we’ve lacked the insight to understand how church culture, people, and congregations are truly doing,” said the Reverend J. Elvin Sadler, the denomination’s general secretary-auditor. “The State of Your Church dashboards will give us a better sense of the spirit and language of the culture (ethos), and powerful new tools to put in the hands of every pastor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rollout marked the first time a major US denomination had deployed Gloo’s framework at scale. For Gloo, the partnership unlocked a real-time, longitudinal data stream from a nationwide religious network, something the company had never had before. It not only validated Gloo’s vision of data-driven ministry but also positioned AME Zion as what the company hopes will be a live test case, persuading other denominations to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The digital supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The digital infrastructure of modern churches often begins with intimacy: a prayer request, a small-group sign-up, a livestream viewed in a moment of loneliness. But beneath these pastoral touchpoints lies a sophisticated pipeline that increasingly mirrors the attention-economy engines of Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charles Kriel, a filmmaker who formerly served as a special advisor to the UK Parliament on disinformation, data, and addictive technology, has particular insight into that connection. Kriel has been working for over a decade on issues related to preserving democracy and countering digital surveillance. He helped write the UK’s Online Safety Act, joining forces with many collaborators, including the Nobel Peace Prize–­winning journalist Maria Ressa and former UK tech minister Damian Collins, in an attempt to rein in Big Tech in the late 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His 2020 documentary film, &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;, investigated how data firms like Gloo and their partners harvest intimate personal information from churchgoers to build psychographic profiles, highlighting how this sensitive data is commodified and raising questions about its potential downstream uses.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Listen, any church with an app? They probably didn’t build that. It’s white label,” Kriel says, referring to services produced by one company and rebranded by another. “And the people who sold it to them are collecting data.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many churches now operate within a layered digital environment, where first-party data collected inside the church is combined with third-party consumer data and psychographic segmentation before being fed into predictive systems. These systems may suggest sermons people might want to view online, match members with small groups, or trigger outreach when engagement drops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In some cases, monitoring can even take the form of biometric surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2014, an Israeli security-tech veteran named Moshe Greenshpan brought airport-grade facial recognition into church entryways. Face-Six, the surveillance suite from the company he founded in 2012, already protected banks and hospitals; its most provocative offshoot, FA6 Events (also known as “Churchix”), repurposes this technology for places of worship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenshpan claims he didn’t originally set out to sell to churches. But over time, as he became increasingly aware of the market, he built FA6 Events as a bespoke solution for them. Today, Greenshpan says, it’s in use at over 200 churches worldwide, nearly half of them in the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, FA6 transforms every entryway into a biometric checkpoint: an instant headcount, a security sweep, and a digital ledger of attendance, all incorporated into the familiar routine of Sunday worship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When someone steps into an FA6-equipped place of worship, a discreet camera mounted at eye level springs to life. Behind the scenes, each captured image is run through a lightning-fast face detector that looks at the whole face. The subject’s cropped face is then aligned, resized, and rotated so the eyes sit on a perfect horizontal line before being fed into a compact neural network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To the best of my knowledge, no church notifies its congregants that it’s using facial recognition.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Moshe Greenshpan, Israeli security-tech veteran&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This onboard neural network quickly captures the features of a person’s face in a unique digital signature called an embedding, allowing for quick identification. These embeddings are compared with thousands of others that are already in the church’s local database, each one tagged with data points like a name, a membership role, or even a flag designating inclusion in an internal watch list. If the match is strong enough, the system makes an identification and records the person’s presence on the church’s secure server.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A congregation can pull full attendance logs, time-stamped entry records, and—critically—alerts whenever someone on a watch list walks through the doors. In this context, a watch list is simply a roster of photos, and sometimes names, of individuals a church has been asked (or elected) to screen out: past disruptors, those subject to trespass or restraining orders, even registered sex offenders. Once that list is uploaded into Churchix, the system instantly flags any match on arrival, pinging security teams or usher staff in real time. Some churches lean on it to spot longtime members who’ve slipped off the radar and trigger pastoral check-ins; others use it as a hard barrier, automatically denying entry to anyone on their locally maintained list.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this data is sent to the cloud; Greenshpan says the company is actively working on a cloud-based application. Instead, all face templates and logs are stored locally on church-owned hardware, encrypted so they can’t be read if someone gains unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Churches can export data from Churchix, he says, but the underlying facial templates remain on premises.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Greenshpan admits, robust technical safeguards do not equal transparency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To the best of my knowledge,” he says, “no church notifies its congregants that it’s using facial recognition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the tools sound invasive, the logic behind them is simple: The more the system knows about you, the more precisely it can intervene.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Every new member of the community within a 20-mile radius—whatever area you choose—we’ll send them a flier inviting them to your church,” Gloo’s Gelsinger says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a tech-powered revival of the casserole ministry. The system pings the church when someone new moves in—“so someone can drop off cookies or lasagna when there’s a newborn in the neighborhood,” he says. “Or just say ‘Hey, welcome. We’re here.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gloo’s back end automates follow-up, too: As soon as a pastor steps down from the pulpit after delivering a sermon, it can be translated into five languages, broken into snippets for small-group study, and repackaged into a draft discussion guide—ready within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger sees the same approach extending to addiction recovery ministries. “We can connect other databases to help churches with recovery centers reach people more effectively,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the data doesn’t stay within the congregation. It flows through customer relationship management (CRM) systems, application programming interfaces, cloud servers, vendor partnerships, and analytics firms. Some of it is used internally in efforts to increase engagement; the rest is repackaged as “insights” and resold to the wider faith-tech marketplace—and sometimes even to networks that target political ads.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We’re sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people.’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Matt Engel, Gloo&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“There is a very specific thing that happens when churches become clients of Gloo,” says Brent Allpress, an academic based in Melbourne, Australia, who was a key researcher on &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;. Gloo gets access to the client church’s databases, he says, and the church “is strongly encouraged to share that data. And Gloo has a mechanism to just hoover that data straight up into their silo.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This process doesn’t happen automatically; the church must opt in by pushing those files or connecting its church-management software system’s database to Gloo via API. Once it’s uploaded, however, all that first-party information lands in Gloo’s analytics engine, ready to be processed and shared with any downstream tools or partners covered by the church’s initial consent to the terms and conditions of its contract with the company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There are religious leaders at the mid and local level who think the use of data is good. They’re using data to identify people in need. Addicts, the grieving,” says Kriel. “And then you have tech people running around misquoting the Bible as justification for their data harvest.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Matt Engel, who held the title executive director of ministry innovation at Gloo when Kriel’s film was made, acknowledged the extent of this harvest in the opening scene.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We measured prayer requests. Call it crazy. But it was like, ‘We’re sitting on mounds of information that could help us steward our people,’” he said in an on-camera interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to Engel—whom Gloo would not make available for public comment—uploading data from anonymous prayer requests to the cloud was Gloo’s first use case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Powering third-party initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gloo’s data infrastructure doesn’t end with its own platform; it also powers third-party initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Communio, a Christian nonprofit focused on marriage and family, used Gloo’s data infrastructure in order to launch “Communio Insights,” a stripped-down version of Gloo’s full analytics platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike Gloo Insights, which provides access to hundreds of demographic, behavioral, health, and psychographic filters, Communio Insights focuses narrowly on relational metrics—indicators of marriage and family stress, involvement in small groups at church—and basic demographic data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the heart of its playbook is a simple, if jarring, analogy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you sell consumer products of different sorts, you’re trying to figure out good ways to market that. And there’s no better product, really, than the gospel,” J.P. De Gance, the founder and president of Communio, said in &lt;em&gt;People You May Know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Communio taps Gloo’s analytics engine—leveraging credit histories, purchasing behavior, public voter rolls, and the database compiled by i360, an analytics company linked to the conservative Koch network—to pinpoint unchurched couples in key regions who are at risk of relationship strain. It then runs microtargeted outreach (using direct mail, text messaging, email, and Facebook Custom Audiences, a tool that lets organizations find and target people who have interacted with them), collecting contact info and survey responses from those who engage. All responses funnel back into Gloo’s platform, where churches monitor attendance, small-group participation, baptisms, and donations to evaluate the campaign’s impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="church window over the parishioners has rays of light emanating from a stained glass eye" class="wp-image-1121586" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parishioners-singing-hyms-while-stained-glass-eye-looks-on-by-michael-byers.jpg?w=1504" width="1504" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;MICHAEL BYERS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigative research by Allpress reveals significant concerns around these operations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2015, two nonprofits—the Relationship Enrichment Collaborative (REC), staffed by former Gloo executives, and its successor, the Culture of Freedom Initiative (now Communio), controlled by the Koch-affiliated nonprofit Philanthropy Roundtable—funded the development of the original Insights platform. Between 2015 and 2017, REC paid approximately $1.3 million to Gloo and $535,000 to Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm notorious for harvesting Facebook users’ personal data and using it for political targeting before the 2016 election, to build and refine psychographic models and a bespoke digital ministry app powering Gloo’s outreach tools. Following REC’s closure, the Culture of Freedom Initiative invested another $375,000 in Gloo and $128,225 in Cambridge Analytica.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;REC’s own 2016 IRS filing describes the work in terse detail: “Provide[d] digital micro-targeted marketing for churches and non-profit champions … using predictive modeling and centralized data analytics we help send the right message to the right couple at the right time based upon their desires and behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of all this documented research, Allpress exposed another critical issue: the explicit use of sensitive health-care data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He found that Gloo Insights combines over 2,000 data points—drawing on everything from nationwide credit and purchasing histories to church management records and Christian psychographic surveys—with filters that make it possible to identify people with health issues such as depression, anxiety, and grief. The result: Facebook Custom Audiences built to zero in on vulnerable individuals via targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These ads invite people suffering from mental-health conditions into church counseling groups “as a pathway to conversion,” Allpress says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These targeted outreach efforts were piloted in cities including Phoenix, Arizona; Dayton, Ohio; and Jacksonville, Florida. Reportedly, as many as 80% of those contacted responded positively, with those who joined a church as new members contributing financially at above-­average rates. In short, Allpress found that pastoral tools had covertly exploited mental-health vulnerabilities and relationship crises for outreach that blurred the lines separating pastoral care, commerce, and implicit political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The legal and ethical vacuum&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Developers of this technology earnestly claim that the systems are designed to enhance care, not exploit people’s need for it. They’re described as ways to tailor support to individual needs, improve follow-up, and help churches provide timely resources. But experts say that without robust data governance or transparency around how sensitive information is used and retained, well-­intentioned pastoral technology could slide into surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, these systems have already been used to surveil and segment congregations. Internal demos and client testimonials confirm that Gloo, for example, uses “grief” as an explicit data point: Churches run campaigns aimed at people flagged for recent bereavement, depression, or anxiety, funneling them into support groups and identifying them for pastoral check-ins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Examining Gloo’s terms and conditions reveals further security and transparency concerns. From nearly a dozen documents, ranging from “click-through” terms for interactive services to master service agreements at the enterprise level, Gloo stitches together a remarkably consistent data-­governance framework. Limits are imposed on any legal action by individual congregants, for example. The click-through agreement corrals users into binding arbitration, bars any class action suits or jury trials, and locks all disputes into New York or Colorado courts, where arbitration is particularly favored over traditional litigation. Meanwhile, its privacy statement carves out broad exceptions for service providers, data-­enrichment partners, and advertising affiliates, giving them carte blanche to use congregants’ data as they see fit. Crucially, Gloo expressly reserves the right to ingest “health and wellness information” provided via wellness assessments or when mental-health keywords appear in prayer requests. This is a highly sensitive category of information that, for health apps, is normally covered by stringent medical-privacy rules like HIPAA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, Gloo is protected by sprawling legal scaffolding, while churches and individual users give up nearly every right to litigate, question data practices, or take collective action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re kind of in the Wild West in terms of the law,” says Adam Schwartz, the director of privacy litigation at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nonprofit watchdog that has spent years wrestling tech giants over data abuses and biometric overreach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the United States, biometric surveillance like that used by growing numbers of churches inhabits a legal twilight zone where regulation is thin, patchy, and often toothless. Schwartz points to Illinois as a rare exception for its Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), one of the nation’s strongest such laws. The statute applies to any organization that captures biometric identifiers—including retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, hand scans, facial geometry, DNA, and other unique biological information. It requires entities to post clear data-collection policies, obtain explicit written consent, and limit how long such data is retained. Failure to comply can expose organizations to class action lawsuits and steep statutory damages—up to $5,000 per violation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But beyond Illinois, protections quickly erode. Though Texas and Washington also have biometric privacy statutes, their bark is stronger than their bite. Efforts to replicate Illinois’s robust protections have been made in over a dozen states—but none have passed. As a result, in much of the country, any checks on biometric surveillance depend more on voluntary transparency and goodwill than any clear legal boundary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is a real potential for information gathered about a person [to] be used against them in their life outside the church.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Emily Tucker, Center on Privacy &amp;amp; Technology at Georgetown Law&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s especially problematic in the church context, says Emily Tucker, executive director of the Center on Privacy &amp;amp; Technology at Georgetown Law, who attended divinity school before becoming a legal scholar. “The necessity of privacy for the possibility of finding personal relationship to the divine—for engaging in rituals of worship, for prayer and penitence, for contemplation and spiritual struggle—is a fundamental principle across almost every religious tradition,” she says. “Imposing a surveillance architecture over the faith community interferes radically with the possibility of that privacy, which is necessary for the creation of sacred space.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tucker researches the intersection of surveillance, civil rights, and marginalized communities. She warns that the personal data being collected through faith-tech platforms is far from secure: “Because corporate data practices are so poorly regulated in this country, there are very few limitations on what companies that take your data can subsequently do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To Tucker, the risks of these platforms outweigh the rewards—especially when biometrics and data collected in a sacred setting could follow people into their daily lives.&amp;nbsp;“Many religious institutions are extremely large and often perform many functions in a given community besides providing a space for worship,” she says. “Many churches, for example, are also employers or providers of social services. There is a real potential for information gathered about a person in their associational activities as a member of a church to then be used against them in their life outside the church.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She points to government dragnet surveillance, the use of IRS data in immigration enforcement, and the vulnerability of undocumented congregants as examples of how faith-tech data could be weaponized beyond its intended use: “Religious institutions are putting the safety of those members at risk by adopting this kind of surveillance technology, which exposes so much personal information to potential abuse and misuse.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, too, says that any perceived benefits must be weighed carefully against the potential harms, especially when sensitive data and vulnerable communities are involved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Churches: Before doing this, you ought to consider the downside, because it can hurt your congregants,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With guardrails still scarce, though, faith-tech pioneers and church leaders are peering ever more deeply into congregants’ lives. Until meaningful oversight arrives, the faithful remain exposed to a gaze they never fully invited and scarcely understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Gelsinger took the stage at a sold-out Missional AI Summit, a flagship event for Christian technologists that this year was organized around the theme “AI Collision: Shaping the Future Together.” Over 500 pastors, engineers, ethicists, and AI developers filled the hall, flashing badges with logos from Google DeepMind, Meta, McKinsey, and Gloo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want to be part of a broader community … so that we’re influential in creating flourishing AI, technology as a force for good, AI that truly embeds the values that we care about,” Gelsinger said at the summit. He likened such tools to pivotal technologies in Christian history: the Roman roads that carried the gospel across the empire, or Martin Luther’s printing press, which shattered monolithic control over scripture. A Gloo spokesperson later confirmed that one of the company’s goals is to shape AI specifically to “contribute to the flourishing of people.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to see AI become just like the internet,” Gelsinger said. “Every single interaction will be infused with AI capabilities.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says Gloo is already mining data across the spectrum of human experience to fuel ever more powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“With AI, computers adapt to us. We talk to them; they hear us; they see us for the first time,” he said. “And now they are becoming a user interface that fits with humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether these technologies ultimately deepen pastoral care or erode personal privacy may hinge on decisions made today about transparency, consent, and accountability. Yet the pace of adoption already outstrips the development of ethical guardrails. Now, one of the questions lingering in the air is not whether AI, facial recognition, and other emerging technologies can serve the church, but how deeply they can be woven into its nervous system to form a new OS for modern Christianity and moral infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s like standing on the beach watching a tsunami in slow motion,” Kriel says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger sees it differently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You and I both need to come to the same position, like Isaiah did,” he told the crowd at the Missional AI Summit. “‘Here am I, Lord. Send me.’ Send me, send us, that we can be shaping technology as a force for good, that we could grab this moment in time.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex Ashley is a journalist whose reporting has appeared in &lt;/em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;Atlantic&lt;em&gt;, NPR, and other national outlets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/19/1121389/ai-data-church-surveillance-america/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Apple AirPods : a gateway hearing aid (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/19/1121384/apple-airpod-pro-2-hearing-aid/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the US Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter hearing-aid software for Apple’s AirPods Pro in September 2024, with a device price point right around $200, I was excited. I have mild to medium hearing loss and tinnitus, and my everyday programmed hearing aids cost just over $2,000—a lower-cost option I chose after my audiologist wanted to put me in a $5,000 pair.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Health insurance in the US does not generally cover the cost of hearing aids, and the vast majority of people who use them pay out of pocket for the devices along with any associated maintenance. Ninety percent of the hearing-aid market is concentrated in the hands of a few companies, so there’s little competitive pricing. The typical patient heads to an audiology clinic, takes a hearing test, gets an audiogram (a graph plotting decibel levels against frequencies to show how loud various sounds need to be for you to hear them), and then receives a recommendation—an interaction that can end up feeling like a high-pressure sales pitch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices should be coming down: In October 2022, the FDA approved the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids without a prescription or audiology exam. These options start around $200, but they are about as different from prescription hearing aids as drugstore reading glasses are from prescription lenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beginning with the AirPods Pro 2, Apple is offering something slightly different: regular earbuds (useful in all the usual ways) with many of the same features as OTC hearing aids. I’m thrilled that a major tech company has entered this field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The most important features for mild hearing loss are programmability, Bluetooth functionality, and the ability to feed sound to both ears. These are features many hearing aids have, but they are less robust and reliable in some of the OTC options.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="iPhone screen mockup" class="wp-image-1121558" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SO25-download-09.png?w=736" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Apple software lets you take a hearing test through the AirPods Pro 2 with your cell phone; your phone then uses that data to program the devices.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF APPLE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AirPods Pro “hearing health experience” lets you take a hearing test through the AirPods themselves with your cell phone; your phone then uses that data to program the hearing aids. No trip to the audiologist, no waiting room where a poster reminds you that hearing loss is associated with earlier cognitive decline, and no low moment afterward when you grapple with the cost.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I desperately wanted the AirPods Pro 2 to be really good, but they’re simply okay. They provide an opportunity for those with mild hearing loss to see if some of the functions of a hearing aid might be useful, but there are some drawbacks. Prescription hearing aids help me with tinnitus; I found that after a day of wear, the AirPods exacerbated it. Functionality to manage tinnitus might be a feature that Apple could and would want to pursue in the future, as an estimated 10% to 15% of the adult population experiences it. The devices also plug your whole ear canal, which can be uncomfortable and even cause swimmer’s ear after hours of use. Some people may feel odd wearing such bulky devices all the time—though they could make you look more like someone signaling “Don’t talk to me, I’m listening to my music” than someone who needs hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the other drawbacks are shared by other devices within their class of OTC hearing aids and even some prescription hearing aids: factors like poor sound quality, inadequate discernment between sounds, and difficulties with certain sound environments, like crowded rooms. Still, while the AirPods are not as good as my budget hearing aid that costs 10 times more, there’s incredible potential here. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley Shew is the author of&lt;/em&gt; Against Technoableism: Rethinking Who Needs Improvement&lt;em&gt; (2023).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the US Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter hearing-aid software for Apple’s AirPods Pro in September 2024, with a device price point right around $200, I was excited.

Eight Sleep, founded in 2014, offers AI-powered sleep tech products that promise to transform your bed into a preventive health device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The New York-based startup announced Tuesday that it raised a fresh $100 million round from investors such as HSG, Valor Equity Partners, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, and athletes including Ferrari F1 driver Charles Leclerc, and Zak Brown, who is the CEO of McLaren F1.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this round, Eight Sleep has raised roughly $260 million total, PitchBook estimates. It previously raised an $86 million Series C in 2021 by investors who assigned it a $500 million post-money valuation. Eight Sleep said its valuation has doubled since its last round, but didn’t disclose specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If we successfully execute our AI roadmap, launch internationally, and develop condition-specific interventions, achieving unicorn status will naturally follow,” Alexandra Zatarain, co-founder and CMO of Eight Sleep, told TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight offers smart mattresses that integrate software and AI to track and enhance sleep quality. Its flagship product, Pod, offers features like measuring sleep stages, heart rate, breathing patterns, and movement. Using these insights, it automatically adjusts temperature, elevation, and firmness. It can also detect snoring and automatically elevate the base in response, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has generated more than $500 million in Pod sales, expanded its revenue tenfold since launching the product in 2019, and collected insights from over one billion hours of recorded sleep data, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight, which employs just over 100 full-time staff, is now expanding beyond the Pod with its Sleep Agent, an AI-driven system that leverages large language models to create thousands of digital twins for each user and predict outcomes, with the goal of optimizing nightly recovery. This approach shifts sleep technology from reactive tracking to proactive, personalized intervention, said Zatarain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sleep tech market features a range of competitors, from wearable devices such as Oura, Fitbit, and Apple, to medical-focused companies like ResMed, as well as smart mattress and sleep surface makers, including Sleep Number and ChiliSleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight’s core differentiator, Autopilot, “builds a personal blueprint from night one, then adapts continuously, accounting for seasonality, travel, stress, training, illness, or even a bad night before. And it works independently for each side of the bed,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to use the new funding to accelerate its growth in the medical sector, building on the Pod’s health-monitoring capabilities. With the introduction of Health Check, the system can monitor cardiovascular and respiratory patterns with up to 99% accuracy without the need for wearable devices, according to the company. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not replacing your doctor, but we are giving you nightly, high-accuracy health monitoring so you can act early if trends shift. Over time, this data can complement medical care,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight’s recently launched Hot Flash Mode employs AI-driven cooling to relieve menopause symptoms. It is also working on contactless solutions for sleep apnea. The company is pursuing FDA approval and will utilize the Pod’s real-time biometric monitoring to deliver personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight Sleep currently ships to over 30 countries — including Canada, the U.K. and EU nations, Australia, Mexico, and the UAE — and is now planning to expand into China. The CMO told TechCrunch that China, as one of the world’s largest consumer markets, is seeing a rise in a health-conscious middle class that prioritizes sleep and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Regarding sensitive health data, Zatarain said the company complies with each locale’s regulations, including for data storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Privacy is foundational. All data is encrypted, never sold, and fully private. We comply with GDPR and CCPA, and unlike many devices, we don’t use microphones. Our biometric sensors are embedded in the bed surface — no wearables, no invasiveness, just passive, high-accuracy insights,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has generated more than $500 million in Pod sales, expanded its revenue tenfold since launching the product in 2019, and collected insights from over one billion hours of recorded sleep data, it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight, which employs just over 100 full-time staff, is now expanding beyond the Pod with its Sleep Agent, an AI-driven system that leverages large language models to create thousands of digital twins for each user and predict outcomes, with the goal of optimizing nightly recovery. This approach shifts sleep technology from reactive tracking to proactive, personalized intervention, said Zatarain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sleep tech market features a range of competitors, from wearable devices such as Oura, Fitbit, and Apple, to medical-focused companies like ResMed, as well as smart mattress and sleep surface makers, including Sleep Number and ChiliSleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight’s core differentiator, Autopilot, “builds a personal blueprint from night one, then adapts continuously, accounting for seasonality, travel, stress, training, illness, or even a bad night before. And it works independently for each side of the bed,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to use the new funding to accelerate its growth in the medical sector, building on the Pod’s health-monitoring capabilities. With the introduction of Health Check, the system can monitor cardiovascular and respiratory patterns with up to 99% accuracy without the need for wearable devices, according to the company. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not replacing your doctor, but we are giving you nightly, high-accuracy health monitoring so you can act early if trends shift. Over time, this data can complement medical care,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight’s recently launched Hot Flash Mode employs AI-driven cooling to relieve menopause symptoms. It is also working on contactless solutions for sleep apnea. The company is pursuing FDA approval and will utilize the Pod’s real-time biometric monitoring to deliver personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eight Sleep currently ships to over 30 countries — including Canada, the U.K. and EU nations, Australia, Mexico, and the UAE — and is now planning to expand into China. The CMO told TechCrunch that China, as one of the world’s largest consumer markets, is seeing a rise in a health-conscious middle class that prioritizes sleep and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Regarding sensitive health data, Zatarain said the company complies with each locale’s regulations, including for data storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Privacy is foundational. All data is encrypted, never sold, and fully private. We comply with GDPR and CCPA, and unlike many devices, we don’t use microphones. Our biometric sensors are embedded in the bed surface — no wearables, no invasiveness, just passive, high-accuracy insights,” Zatarain said.&lt;/p&gt;

Smart move! But, before you start envisioning robots handling your customer service and algorithms optimising everything from inventory to cafeteria orders, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the costs no one mentions at those slick AI vendor presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, everyone knows that AI involves up-front investment. What they don’t tell you is that the sticker price is just the tip of the iceberg. The real costs lurk beneath the waterline, waiting to ambush even the most experienced executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-data-infrastructure-reality-check"&gt;The data infrastructure reality check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about AI – it’s hungry. Ravenously hungry for data. And not just any data, but clean, structured, properly formatted data that’s actually usable. Most companies find their data is scattered in multiple systems, inconsistent, and quite frankly, a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to invest heavily in data infrastructure before your brand-new AI tools can even think about delivering return. That means data engineers, cloud storage costs that scale faster than your daily coffee addiction, and integration specialists whose prices would make your accountant weep. And then there are the ongoing costs of maintaining data pipelines and ensuring everything stays in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-talent-wars-are-real-and-expensive"&gt;The talent wars are real (and expensive)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI talent is not just difficult to locate – it’s a case of looking for a unicorn that just so happens to also know your specific industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experienced AI professionals are in heavy demand, and salaries reflect that reality. Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI specialists command top-shelf compensation that can quickly drain your carefully managed budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet here’s the rub: you cannot just hire one person and call it a day. You need entire teams with diverse skill sets. Some executives pursue additional education like a DBA doctorate online to better understand the technical landscape, but even with more knowledge, gaining the right team is a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need ongoing training programs, competitive retention packages, and possibly some counseling for your HR department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-integration-nightmares-nobody-warns-you-about"&gt;Integration nightmares nobody warns you about&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your existing systems weren’t designed with AI in mind. Merging AI solutions and legacy systems often entails extensive customisation, middleware development, and complete system redesigns. What starts out as a simple ‘plug-and-play’ solution quickly evolves into a complex web of integrations that require expert consultants and extended timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret costs in this case are system downtime during integration, backup systems while you’re making the switch, and the debugging sessions that go late into the night. Your IT people will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-learning-curve-is-steeper-than-mount-everest"&gt;The learning curve is steeper than Mount Everest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing AI is not just a matter of technology – it is a matter of changing how your entire organisation works. Your people need to be trained, and not with a rushed lunch-and-learn, either. We’re talking about substantive education programs that allow employees to learn not just how to use AI tools, but also how to interpret results, make decisions from AI-generated insights, and avoid pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-change-management"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are going to be employees who will embrace the technology and those who will resist it with the passion of someone protecting their parking spot.

They must be constantly watched, updated, and tuned. Models must be retrained as data patterns change, algorithms must be refined as business conditions evolve, and security measures must be continuously upgraded to defend against new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ongoing-expenses"&gt;Ongoing expenses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing expenses include expert technical support, occasional model refreshes, performance tracking, and the inevitable troubleshooting when things do not work out as intended.

Depending on your industry, you’ll have increasing oversight of AI decision-making processes, data use, and algorithmic bias. Creating robust governance frameworks, adhering to evolving regulations, and maintaining audit trails is another level of complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-advice"&gt;Legal advice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need legal advisors familiar with AI regulations, compliance officers able to interpret algorithmic decisions, and documentation processes that would make a librarian proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation costs of AI overshadow the initial outlay. Smart CEOs budget a minimum of 2-3 times their early estimates and prepare for a process more marathon than sprint. The good news? Companies that properly anticipate these hidden costs and strategically invest in AI infrastructure on a consistent basis often achieve dramatic returns. The key is coming in with eyes open, realistic timetables, and budgets that account for the full picture of transformation ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, AI is not a technology purchase – it’s a fundamental reshaping of your company’s operations.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He was in a coffee meeting with Nexus Venture Partner’s Abhishek Sharma at the Blue Bottle in San Francisco’s South Park (a favorite VC haunt). While describing the future of the company, he was gesturing so animatedly that his chair tipped over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I actually fell out of my chair. And Abhishek, as a great investor does, caught the chair and me as I was falling,” Peffer described with a laugh. That felt like a symbol for how the founder/investor relationship is supposed to work. “I think that was a clear signal that he was the right partner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Firecrawl announced a Series A led by Nexus with participation from Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke and existing investor Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Firecrawl offers a popular open source web crawler for developers and AI agents, with a commercially supported version available through an API. It’s used by 350,000 developers, has nearly 50,000 stars on GitHub, and its notable customers include Shopify, Replit, and Zapier as well as “some of the largest hedge funds in the world,” Peffer told TechCrunch. And, he says, the company is already profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup also just released an API that supports search and will soon add support for natural language prompts, as co-founder and CTO Nicolas Silberstein Camara noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peffer, who co-founded Firecrawl in 2022 with Camara and CMO Eric Ciarla, said gaining Lütke as an investor was “the best kind of validation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They landed him through a gutsy email after discovering the Shopify founder had signed up to try their product through their self-service portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We saw his email come in,” Peffer said. The Firecrawl crew immediately emailed him to welcome him as a customer, but got no response. Two months later, some Shopify folks contacted Firecrawl for an enterprise contract. So Peffer took his shot and emailed Lütke again, mentioning they’d love for him to participate in their upcoming round.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This time, Lütke responded with compliments about their product. He was in.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While AI web crawlers have a somewhat dubious reputation these days, mostly due to bad actors that ignore robot.txt files, they are also a necessary part of the burgeoning AI world. AI trains on the web, agents need to access web pages to perform their duties, and enterprises need personalized crawlers to consume their own websites for training and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Firecrawl founders also hope to help address the frustrating parts of their industry. They are working on tools to help website owners, publishers, and other content creators “get paid when AI uses their content. We think this is the way it should be,” Peffer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While there have been lots of efforts around this idea from big names like Adobe and Getty, as well as startups like Bria, Calliope Networks, and others, Peffer feels that Firecrawl has an edge because it’s already working with those who are scraping data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We already have one side of the marketplace,” he said. “What we want to do is just connect that side of the marketplace to the website owners, the publishers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, Firecrawl also went viral a few months ago for reasons that have little to do with their open source tool. They had posted an ad to the YC job board looking to hire an AI agent as an employee for a $15,000 salary — perhaps the first job ad for an agent employee, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That job search didn’t yield an agent worth hiring, so Firecrawl increased the budget to $1 million to hire several agents and the developers who built them, and tried again. Applicants flooded in, Peffer said, but the company hasn’t yet hired any. The founders realized that evaluating and managing wanna-be agent employees is a job in itself. So now they are looking for an AI chief of staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Firecrawl’s Peffer will be onstage at Disrupt in October to discuss all that he’s learned in a session that covers the pros and cons of hiring AI agents as early employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Firecrawl’s Peffer will be onstage at Disrupt in October to discuss all that he’s learned in a session that covers the pros and cons of hiring AI agents as early employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should AI flatter us, fix us, or just inform us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;How do you want your AI to treat you?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a serious question, and it’s one that Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has clearly been chewing on since GPT-5’s bumpy launch at the start of the month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He faces a trilemma. Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane, and if these are indeed AI’s options, the rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.

This isn’t just about economic growth; it’s about national security and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for specialised AI chips is exploding, set to grow by 30% every year and make up more than half of the entire global semiconductor industry by 2030. The question is, will the UK have a piece of that pie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-about-artificial-actual-intelligence"&gt;It’s about &lt;s&gt;artificial&lt;/s&gt; actual intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s get one thing straight: this isn’t about trying to build giant, multi-billion-dollar manufacturing plants to compete with global titans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CST makes it clear that we often confuse chip design with chip manufacturing, and they are two completely different ball games. While a factory costs a fortune, designing a chip is a creative, knowledge-intensive process that plays to the UK’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a national tendency to conflate chip design (one of the fastest growing industries in the world) with chip manufacturing (one of the most expensive industries in the world),” the report points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is ambitious but achievable: create the right conditions for UK companies to design 50 new AI chip products in the next five years. But to get there, we need to tackle some serious gaps in skills, funding, and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uk-faces-ai-chip-design-skills-gap"&gt;UK faces AI chip design skills gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest roadblock is that we simply don’t have enough people to do the work. The UK’s current chip industry is already short about 7,000 designers. To hit that target of 50 new AI chips, we’d need another 5,000 designers – bringing the total to 12,000 – in just five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re not even close to producing those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fix this, the report urges the government to fund more university bursaries and fellowships to tempt students into the field. It also calls for a top-tier, nationally-recognised chip design course that can be rolled out across the country, getting more people skilled up, fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a golden opportunity in optoelectronics, the tech that uses light to transmit data, which is required for next-gen AI systems and an area where the UK already quite literally shines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-realism-and-a-coordinated-plan"&gt;Realism and a coordinated plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, ambition needs to be matched by a smart, coordinated strategy. The CST report criticises the current siloed approach where different government departments, like the DSIT and the Ministry of Defence, work on their own plans despite having the same goals. They need to work together to spot opportunities for technology that serves both commercial and defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry experts agree that the focus on design is the right one, but they also caution that it won’t be a walk in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headshot of Phillip Kaye, Co-Founder of Vespertec, for an article on AI chip design in the UK." class="wp-image-109014" height="800" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Phillip-Kaye-Cofounder-Vespertec-uk-ai-chip-design-industry.jpeg" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillip Kaye, Co-Founder of Vespertec, puts it this way: “The UK might not be an AI superpower yet – but if we’re ever going to achieve that status, this would be the place to start. British-led semiconductor research has long been among the best in the world, so it makes sense for us to build on this existing advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he adds a reality check. “More and better semiconductors don’t immediately translate into a mature AI chip industry… Giants like NVIDIA still dominate in no small part because they’ve built these networks over decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report acknowledges this challenge, noting that UK startups need affordable access to the expensive design tools and licenses controlled by overseas giants. It suggests the government should step in and negotiate access on a national level, potentially as part of trade deals, to give our homegrown companies a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without our own AI chip design industry, the UK faces a future where our critical infrastructure is powered by technology from a “single dominant supplier,” a situation the report calls “problematic for many reasons”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the feeling isn’t one of despair; it’s one of urgent opportunity.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature, which is available in any market where Meta AI is available, allows creators to translate content into other languages so it can be viewed by a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature was first announced at Meta’s Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators’ voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta notes that the AI translations will use the sound and tone of the creator’s own voice to make the dubbed voice sound authentic when translating the content to a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a pair of screenshots showing the new translation feature in Instagram" class="wp-image-3037964" height="934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-reel.webp" width="1236" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. Creators can then toggle the button to turn on translations and choose if they want to include lip-syncing, too. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators can view translations and lip syncs before they’re posted publicly and can toggle off either option at any time. (Rejecting the translation won’t impact the original reel, the company notes.) Viewers watching the translated reel will see a notice at the bottom that indicates it was translated with Meta AI. Those who don’t want to see translated reels in select languages can disable this in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="another screenshot from the new feature, showing how users can manage their voice translations" class="wp-image-3037963" height="954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-notification.webp" width="1242" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators are also gaining access to a new metric in their Insights panel, where they can see their views by language. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. Minimal background noise or music also helps. The feature only supports up to two speakers, and they should not talk over each other for the translation to work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Facebook creators will be able to upload up to 20 of their own dubbed audio tracks to a reel to expand their audience beyond those in English- or Spanish-speaking markets. This is offered in the “Closed captions and translations” section of the Meta Business Suite and supports the addition of translations both before and after publishing, unlike the AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta says more languages will be supported in the future but did not detail which ones would be next to come or when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe there are lots of amazing creators out there who have potential audiences who don’t necessarily speak the same language,” explained Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a post on Instagram. “And if we can help you reach those audiences who speak other languages, reach across cultural and linguistic barriers, we can help you grow your following and get more value out of Instagram and the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch of the AI feature comes as multiple reports indicate that Meta is restructuring its AI group again to focus on four key areas: research, superintelligence, products, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta is rolling out an AI-powered voice translation feature to all users on Facebook and Instagram globally, the company announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature, which is available in any market where Meta AI is available, allows creators to translate content into other languages so it can be viewed by a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature was first announced at Meta’s Connect developer conference last year, where the company said it would pilot test automatic translations of creators’ voices in reels across both Facebook and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta notes that the AI translations will use the sound and tone of the creator’s own voice to make the dubbed voice sound authentic when translating the content to a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, creators can optionally use a lip-sync feature to align the translation with their lip movements, which makes it seem more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="a pair of screenshots showing the new translation feature in Instagram" class="wp-image-3037964" height="934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-reel.webp" width="1236" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, the feature supports translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, with more languages to be added over time. These AI translations are available to Facebook creators with 1,000 or more followers and all public Instagram accounts globally, where Meta AI is offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To access the option, creators can click on “Translate your voice with Meta AI” before publishing their reel. Creators can then toggle the button to turn on translations and choose if they want to include lip-syncing, too. When they click “Share now” to publish their reel, the translation will be available automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators can view translations and lip syncs before they’re posted publicly and can toggle off either option at any time. (Rejecting the translation won’t impact the original reel, the company notes.) Viewers watching the translated reel will see a notice at the bottom that indicates it was translated with Meta AI. Those who don’t want to see translated reels in select languages can disable this in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="another screenshot from the new feature, showing how users can manage their voice translations" class="wp-image-3037963" height="954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meta-ai-translation-notification.webp" width="1242" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Creators are also gaining access to a new metric in their Insights panel, where they can see their views by language. This can help them better understand how their content is reaching new audiences via translations — something that will be more helpful as additional languages are supported over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta recommends that creators who want to use the feature face forward, speak clearly, and avoid covering their mouth when recording. Minimal background noise or music also helps. The feature only supports up to two speakers, and they should not talk over each other for the translation to work.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, Facebook creators will be able to upload up to 20 of their own dubbed audio tracks to a reel to expand their audience beyond those in English- or Spanish-speaking markets. This is offered in the “Closed captions and translations” section of the Meta Business Suite and supports the addition of translations both before and after publishing, unlike the AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;

Four days later, the change has been made official with an internal memo, as reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times. The changes were announced by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who joined Meta as Chief AI officer in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s new organization for AI will be called the Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The centerpiece is a new group called TBD Labs, which will be run by Wang. The group will focus on foundation models like Llama series, which had its latest release in April. The other three groups will focused on research, product integration, and infrastructure respectively.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta has put significant resources into revamping its AI organization in recent months in response to concerns that it was being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind.
