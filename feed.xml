&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s no hyperbole to suggest that ChatGPT subsequently transformed the worlds of business and tech, becoming enormously popular — it’s still in the number one spot on Apple’s free app rankings today — while also serving as the catalyst for a flood of generative AI products.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s even made people suspicious of the em dash, which no chatbot will ever take from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In fact, “Empire of AI” author Karen Hao argued in a recent interview with TechCrunch that OpenAI has “already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation-state in the world,” and is now “rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There may be even more dramatic changes to come. Charlie Warzel wrote in The Atlantic that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Bloomberg took a more focused look at how ChatGPT has transformed the stock market. The most obvious winner so far has been Nvidia, with its stock up 979% since the chatbot launched. But AI fever has also buoyed other Big Tech companies, with the seven most valuable companies on the S&amp;amp;P 500 — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom — all tied to tech, and with their collective growth accounting for nearly half of the benchmark’s 64% increase since ChatGPT was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This has made for a more top-heavy market. The S&amp;amp;P 500 is weighted based on market capitalization, and those same seven companies now account for 35% of the weighting, compared to around 20% three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How long will this growth last? With the notable exception of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, it’s become increasingly common for AI executives to acknowledge that we might be in a bubble (or if you prefer, a “mania”).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&amp;nbsp;“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August, at a dinner with journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, Sierra CEO and OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor agreed we are “in a bubble” that he compared it to the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. While individual companies might fail, he predicted, “AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In another three years — or less — we might know whether that optimism was warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;On November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, innocuously describing it as “a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Sacks fired back in a post on X, in which he described a five-month reporting process in which accusations were “debunked in detail.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger,” Sacks said. “Anyone who reads the story carefully can see that they strung together a bunch of anecdotes that don’t support the headline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t the first time critics have suggested that there may be conflicts of interest between Sacks’ political role and his investments. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — said earlier this year that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, telling TechCrunch, “This is graft.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI businesses in their marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To illustrate Sacks’ “intertwined interests,” the NYT pointed to the White House summit in July where Trump unveiled his AI roadmap — White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly stepped in to prevent the All-In podcast (which Sacks co-hosts) from being the only host of the event. And All-In asked potential sponsors to pay $1 million for access to a private reception and other events, the NYT claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The NYT also reported that Sacks became close with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this spring and has played a role in removing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales around the world, including in China.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right-wing media personality and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who’s made no secret of his animosity towards some of Trump’s Silicon Valley allies) said Sacks is emblematic of an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks’ spokesperson Jessica Hoffman told the NYT that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Hoffman said Sacks has complied with the rules for special government employees, that the Office of Government Ethics determined which investments he had to sell, and that his role in the government has cost him, rather than benefited him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Sacks has been “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks’ post responding to the NYT includes a letter written to the newspaper from Clare Locke, a law firm that Sacks hired, claiming that the reporters had been given “clear marching orders: find and report on a conflict of interest between Mr. Sacks’ duties in the White House and his background in the private technology sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also addresses some of the specifics of the NYT story, including the All-In podcast’s role in the White House AI event. Sacks’ lawyers said the AI summit was a not-for-profit event, and that the All-In podcast “lost money hosting the event.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Two sponsors were brought on to help partially defray the cost of the event, for which they received nothing but logo placements,” the letter said. “No access to President Trump was ever offered, and no VIP reception ever took place.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-604487976.jpg?resize=1200,798" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;David Sacks’ role as President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar could work out very well for his investments, as well as his friends, according to a new report The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that doesn’t make Cameron a fan of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a CBS Sunday Morning interview tied to the upcoming release of “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the director acknowledged that performance capture (where an actor’s performance is recorded as a template for digital artists) can sound similar to genAI. But in reality, he said it’s “the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh they’re doing something strange with computers, and they’re replacing actors,’” Cameron said. “When in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indeed, the CBS segment shows members of the “Avatar” cast performing their underwater scenes in a 250,000-gallon water tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Go to the other end of the spectrum and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character, they can make up an actor, they can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt,” Cameron added. “No, that’s horrifying … That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
