&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The banquet seating chart included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, the U.S. and U.K. signed a partnership called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the U.K., while CoreWeave and Salesforce announced a multibillion-pound investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names than the Hollywood types that often attend such affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This change reveals the shifting economic needs of the U.K. and U.S. in the age of AI, as well as the rising prominence of technology and its leaders in Trump’s second administration. Just this past year, numerous Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Apple have pledged to work with the government, from providing AI assistant tools to government services to building digital health ecosystems for the U.S. health industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The president has also taken a sharper focus on tech — criticizing Tim Cook for Apple’s outsourced supply chain, signing an “anti-woke” AI order, and instructing the attorney general to investigate private companies receiving federal funds that have DEI programs deemed “illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and other tech leaders attended the president’s inauguration this year. And, in early September, President Trump threw a tech dinner with 33 top names in Silicon Valley, including Altman, Cook, and Zuckerberg. Musk, a former senior adviser to the president, once known as “First Buddy,” was not present at either dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Now that it's looking like Chrome will remain in the Google fold, the browser is undergoing a Gemini-infused rebirth. Google claims the browser will see its most significant upgrade ever in the next few weeks as AI permeates every part of the experience. For people who use AI tools, some of these additions might actually be helpful, and for everyone else, well, Firefox still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prominent change, and one that AI subscribers may have already seen, is the addition of a Gemini button on the desktop browser. This button opens a popup where you can ask questions about—and get summaries of—content in your open tabs. Android phones already have Gemini operating at the system level to accomplish similar tasks, but Google says the iOS Gemini app will soon be built into Chrome for Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini isn't limited to your current tab. Google aims to make it possible to interact with other apps and tabs without leaving the current screen. When you invoke Gemini in Chrome, it can work with the content in all your open tabs, and it has connections to Google products like Calendar and YouTube. It can also find links in your history based on a vague remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI mode is also moving closer to becoming Google's default way to search the web. The updated Chrome now lets you begin AI Mode searches from the omnibar. There's a button to press if you want AI Mode, but it would be quite easy to swap in AI Mode for traditional searches in the browser. The omnibox will also gain "ask about this page" functionality. Chrome can suggest these questions (in English only for now) and show the answer in a side panel. The answer will, naturally, lead off with an AI Overview, and you can ask follow-up questions in AI Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says it's also using AI to shore up Chrome's security. Gemini tools can already identify common tech support scams. An updated Gemini Nano model will be deployed that expands those detection features to spot fake virus alerts and phony giveaways. Chrome's password manager already tells you about compromised passwords, but with its AI overhaul, it can also automatically change them for you with one click. Although, it seems like that could easily go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;An agentic future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browser's new AI features are things we've seen in testing or early access, and they'll be fully rolled out to Chrome users in the coming weeks. Chrome's next trick will take a bit longer. Later this year, Google says it will add agentic control to Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen a few of these "usage agents" over the past year, including OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Claude for Chrome. These systems can theoretically control your computer's cursor to complete tasks on your behalf. Google suggests tedious or repetitive things like scheduling a haircut or ordering groceries as a good job for the Chrome agent. Just type your request and watch it go (sort of). Here's a demo from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2117914-1" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InstaCart_example.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, usage agents have faced two significant issues: They're slow and expensive. These are generative AI systems, so they won't perform perfectly even as they chew through a mountain of costly tokens. OpenAI Operator is only available for limited use on the $200-per-month subscription, and Anthropic's agent may rack up a few dollars in API charges for completing a simple action like visiting a handful of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't yet know how reliable or fast Google's Chrome agent will be, nor is there any word on additional cost. Google's blog post doesn't even mention restricting this feature to those with subscriptions, but it does have murky limits on many of its AI tools. We've reached out to Google for clarification on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's agentic browsing assistant may not be any better than what you can get from the competition, but the prevalence of Chrome will get the technology in front of many more people. But will it really be everyone? This company is no stranger to burning money to gain a foothold in AI, but allowing billions of people to tinker with an expensive computer-use model might be a tough sell even for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gemini isn't limited to your current tab. Google aims to make it possible to interact with other apps and tabs without leaving the current screen. When you invoke Gemini in Chrome, it can work with the content in all your open tabs, and it has connections to Google products like Calendar and YouTube. It can also find links in your history based on a vague remembrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI mode is also moving closer to becoming Google's default way to search the web. The updated Chrome now lets you begin AI Mode searches from the omnibar. There's a button to press if you want AI Mode, but it would be quite easy to swap in AI Mode for traditional searches in the browser. The omnibox will also gain "ask about this page" functionality. Chrome can suggest these questions (in English only for now) and show the answer in a side panel. The answer will, naturally, lead off with an AI Overview, and you can ask follow-up questions in AI Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says it's also using AI to shore up Chrome's security. Gemini tools can already identify common tech support scams. An updated Gemini Nano model will be deployed that expands those detection features to spot fake virus alerts and phony giveaways. Chrome's password manager already tells you about compromised passwords, but with its AI overhaul, it can also automatically change them for you with one click. Although, it seems like that could easily go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An agentic future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browser's new AI features are things we've seen in testing or early access, and they'll be fully rolled out to Chrome users in the coming weeks. Chrome's next trick will take a bit longer. Later this year, Google says it will add agentic control to Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen a few of these "usage agents" over the past year, including OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Claude for Chrome. These systems can theoretically control your computer's cursor to complete tasks on your behalf. Google suggests tedious or repetitive things like scheduling a haircut or ordering groceries as a good job for the Chrome agent. Just type your request and watch it go (sort of). Here's a demo from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;
    &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" controls="controls" height="1080" id="video-2117914-1" preload="metadata" width="1920"&gt;&lt;source src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InstaCart_example.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4" /&gt;A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      A demo of Chrome's upcoming usage agent, presumably sped up for the video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, usage agents have faced two significant issues: They're slow and expensive. These are generative AI systems, so they won't perform perfectly even as they chew through a mountain of costly tokens. OpenAI Operator is only available for limited use on the $200-per-month subscription, and Anthropic's agent may rack up a few dollars in API charges for completing a simple action like visiting a handful of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't yet know how reliable or fast Google's Chrome agent will be, nor is there any word on additional cost. Google's blog post doesn't even mention restricting this feature to those with subscriptions, but it does have murky limits on many of its AI tools. We've reached out to Google for clarification on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's agentic browsing assistant may not be any better than what you can get from the competition, but the prevalence of Chrome will get the technology in front of many more people. But will it really be everyone? This company is no stranger to burning money to gain a foothold in AI, but allowing billions of people to tinker with an expensive computer-use model might be a tough sell even for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;We compared Sensible Agent to a conventional, voice-controlled AR assistant baseline. We measured cognitive load using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), overall usability with the System Usability Scale (SUS), user preference on a 7-point Likert scale, and total interaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant finding was the reduction in cognitive workload. The NASA-TLX data showed that on a 100-point scale for mental demand, the average score for Sensible Agent was 21.1, compared to 65.0 for the baseline with a statistically significant difference (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). We saw a similar significant reduction in perceived effort (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .0039), which suggests that the proactive system successfully offloaded the mental work of forming a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding usability, both systems performed well, with no statistically significant difference between their SUS scores (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .11). However, participants expressed a strong and statistically significant preference for Sensible Agent (&lt;i&gt;𝑝&lt;/i&gt; = .0074). On a 7-point scale, the average preference rating was 6.0 for Sensible Agent, compared to 3.8 for the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the interaction time, logged from the moment a prompt was triggered to the final system response to the user's input, the baseline was faster (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 16.4s) compared to Sensible Agent (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 28.5s). This difference is an expected trade-off of the system’s two-step interaction flow, where the agent first proposes an action and the user then confirms it. The strong user preference for Sensible Agent suggests this trade-off was acceptable, particularly in social contexts where discretion and minimal user effort were important.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as their primary cloud computing provider, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals AWS and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI, and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition, spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it’s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder’s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Part of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1709348485.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At a keynote at its Huawei Connect conference&amp;nbsp;on Thursday, Shenzhen, China-based&amp;nbsp;Huawei announced&amp;nbsp;new&amp;nbsp;SuperPoD&amp;nbsp;Interconnect&amp;nbsp;technology that can link&amp;nbsp;together up to 15,000&amp;nbsp;graphics cards, including Huawei’s Ascend AI chips, to increase compute power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This news also comes just a day after&amp;nbsp;China banned domestic tech companies&amp;nbsp;from buying Nvidia’s hardware, including&amp;nbsp;Nvidia’s&amp;nbsp;RTX Pro 600D servers specifically designed for the market in China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This news also comes just a day after&amp;nbsp;China banned domestic tech companies&amp;nbsp;from buying Nvidia’s hardware, including&amp;nbsp;Nvidia’s&amp;nbsp;RTX Pro 600D servers specifically designed for the market in China.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to the U.K. this week culminated in an NVIDIA AI ecosystem celebration today at Vision Hall in London, where he welcomed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Liz Kendall on stage to discuss the nation’s “Goldilocks moment” where world-class universities, researchers, startups and venture capitalists converge to create a golden network for building out the nation’s AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang also highlighted plans for the U.K.’s AI infrastructure on a panel with Peter Kyle, U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade, and Howard Lutnick, U.S. Secretary of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85152"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-85152 size-full" height="680" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UK-Visit-YAR05086_isp.jpg" width="1280" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-85152"&gt;Panel with U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade Peter Kyle, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, Huang said. Now, it’s the world’s third largest AI market — home to 3,700 companies and 60,000 employees, a powerhouse of talent and enterprise — making it an ideal ecosystem for pushing forth the next industrial revolution driven by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the biggest-ever tech agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom,” said Starmer. He highlighted that the U.K’s work with NVIDIA and the U.S. government is focused on using AI for security and safety for both countries, in addition to business and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[AI], which some people find strange and confusing, can open doors,” said Secretary Kendall. “The role of this government is to open doors … and together with [NVIDIA], we can open those doors and give that hope to people in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just about London,” Secretary Kyle said, highlighting the collaboration’s reach will span Belfast, Manchester, Edinburgh and other parts of the country. “What you’re seeing is the renewal, the refocus and crucially, the modernizing of the special relationship [between the U.K. and U.S.],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That modernization taps into AI and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary Lutnick emphasized the importance of building this infrastructure, highlighting how the U.S. is bringing more energy online to power the AI factories that will make this transformation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we need to do is to build — and that’s part of our philosophy: to build sufficiently at home so that we have the capacity to care for ourselves and the rest of the world if we need to,” Lutnick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining supercomputing hyperscale facilities and AI investments in Britain will result in incredible scientific exploration and discovery — and crucially, the commercialization of it, Kyle added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe the greatest natural resource of the U.K. is the incredible researchers and scientists,” Huang said. “It is really quite extraordinary. Your universities are creating critical thinkers, independent thinkers, creative thinkers — and they invent amazing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 500 attendees from startups, venture capital companies, higher education and industry came together at the event to forge connections, exchange ideas and catalyze new growth opportunities at the forefront of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

There was the time Google said its latest quantum chip indicated multiple universes exist. Or when Anthropic gave its AI agent Claudius a snack&amp;nbsp;vending machine to run and it went amok, calling security on people and insisting it was human. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This week, it was OpenAI’s turn to raise our collective eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released on Monday some research that explained how it’s stopping AI models from “scheming.” It’s a  practice in which an “AI behaves one way on the surface while hiding its true goals,” OpenAI defined in its tweet about the research.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;paper, conducted with Apollo Research, researchers went a bit further, likening AI scheming to a human stock broker breaking the law to make as much money as possible. The researchers, however, argued that most AI “scheming” wasn’t that harmful. “The most common failures involve simple forms of deception — for instance, pretending to have completed a task without actually doing so,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The paper was mostly published to show that “deliberative alignment⁠”&amp;nbsp;— the anti-scheming technique they were testing — worked well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But&amp;nbsp;it also explained that AI developers haven’t figured out a way to train their models not to scheme. That’s because such training could actually teach the model how to scheme even better to avoid being detected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A major failure mode of attempting to ‘train out’ scheming is simply teaching the model to scheme more carefully and covertly,” the researchers wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing part is that, if a model understands that it’s&amp;nbsp;being tested, it can pretend it’s not scheming just to pass the test, even if it is still scheming. “Models often become more aware that they are being evaluated. This situational awareness can itself reduce scheming, independent of genuine alignment,” the researchers wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not news that AI models will lie. By now most of us have experienced AI hallucinations, or the model confidently giving an answer to a prompt that simply isn’t true. But hallucinations are basically presenting guesswork with confidence, as OpenAI research released earlier this month documented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Scheming is something else. It’s deliberate. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even this revelation — that a model will deliberately mislead humans — isn’t new.&amp;nbsp;Apollo Research first published a paper in December documenting how five models schemed when they were given instructions to achieve a goal&amp;nbsp;“at all costs.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news here is actually good news: The researchers saw significant reductions in scheming by using “deliberative alignment⁠.” That technique involves teaching the model an “anti-scheming specification” and then making the model go review it before acting. It’s a bit like making little kids repeat the rules&amp;nbsp;before allowing them to play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI researchers insist that the lying they’ve caught with their own models, or even with ChatGPT, isn’t that serious. As OpenAI’s co-founder Wojciech Zaremba told TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff about this research: “This work has been done in the simulated environments, and we think it represents future use cases. However,&amp;nbsp;today, we haven’t seen this kind of consequential scheming in our production traffic. Nonetheless, it is well known that there are forms of deception in ChatGPT. You might ask it to implement some website, and it might tell you, ‘Yes, I did a great job.’ And that’s just the lie. There are some petty forms of deception that we still need to address.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fact that AI models from multiple players intentionally deceive humans is, perhaps, understandable. They were built by humans, to mimic humans, and (synthetic data aside) for the most part trained on data produced by humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also bonkers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While we’ve all experienced the frustration of poorly performing technology (thinking of you, home printers of yesteryear), when was the last time your not-AI software deliberately lied to you? Has your inbox ever fabricated&amp;nbsp;emails on its own? Has your CMS logged new prospects that didn’t exist to pad its numbers? Has your fintech app made up its own bank transactions?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth pondering this as the corporate world barrels toward an AI future where companies believe agents can be treated like independent employees. The researchers of this paper have the same warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As AIs are assigned more complex tasks with real-world consequences and begin pursuing more ambiguous, long-term goals, we expect that the potential for harmful scheming will grow — so our safeguards and our ability to rigorously test must grow correspondingly,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-484036335.jpg?resize=1200,912" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Every now and then, researchers at the biggest tech companies drop a bombshell.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news here is actually good news: The researchers saw significant reductions in scheming by using “deliberative alignment⁠.” That technique involves teaching the model an “anti-scheming specification” and then making the model go review it before acting. It’s a bit like making little kids repeat the rules&amp;nbsp;before allowing them to play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI researchers insist that the lying they’ve caught with their own models, or even with ChatGPT, isn’t that serious. As OpenAI’s co-founder Wojciech Zaremba told TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff about this research: “This work has been done in the simulated environments, and we think it represents future use cases. However,&amp;nbsp;today, we haven’t seen this kind of consequential scheming in our production traffic. Nonetheless, it is well known that there are forms of deception in ChatGPT. You might ask it to implement some website, and it might tell you, ‘Yes, I did a great job.’ And that’s just the lie. There are some petty forms of deception that we still need to address.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The fact that AI models from multiple players intentionally deceive humans is, perhaps, understandable. They were built by humans, to mimic humans, and (synthetic data aside) for the most part trained on data produced by humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s also bonkers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While we’ve all experienced the frustration of poorly performing technology (thinking of you, home printers of yesteryear), when was the last time your not-AI software deliberately lied to you? Has your inbox ever fabricated&amp;nbsp;emails on its own? Has your CMS logged new prospects that didn’t exist to pad its numbers? Has your fintech app made up its own bank transactions?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth pondering this as the corporate world barrels toward an AI future where companies believe agents can be treated like independent employees. The researchers of this paper have the same warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As AIs are assigned more complex tasks with real-world consequences and begin pursuing more ambiguous, long-term goals, we expect that the potential for harmful scheming will grow — so our safeguards and our ability to rigorously test must grow correspondingly,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/openais-research-on-ai-models-deliberately-lying-is-wild/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 22:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] What does the future hold for generative AI?

            &lt;p&gt;When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world in 2022, it brought generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and started a snowball effect that led to its rapid integration into industry, scientific research, health care, and the everyday lives of people who use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes next for this powerful but imperfect tool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that question in mind, hundreds of researchers, business leaders, educators, and students gathered at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium for the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium (MGAIC) Symposium on Sept. 17 to share insights and discuss the potential future of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment — generative AI is moving fast. It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a&amp;nbsp;consortium of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”&lt;/p&gt;
