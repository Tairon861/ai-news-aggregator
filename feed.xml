&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/In-scope.jpg?resize=1200,1012" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Even without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.&lt;/p&gt;

The group, Leading the Future, is armed with more than $100 million from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI search startup Perplexity, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bores’ response was simple: bring it on.&amp;nbsp;Now, he’s got the muscle to back that challenge up.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Public First Action, a PAC backed by a $20 million donation from Anthropic, is spending $450,000 to boost Bores in the race for New York’s 12th congressional district, reports Bloomberg. Like its rival, the committee is pro-AI, but it’s pitching a different vision, one centered on transparency, safety standards, and public oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the industry-backed PAC, Leading the Future, has already poured $1.1 million into ads attacking Bores, largely because he sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, which requires major AI developers to disclose safety protocols and report serious misuse of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259873774.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Late last year, New York Assembly member Alex Bores became the target of a campaign by a pro-AI super PAC to thwart his congressional bid.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes as India has become a key battleground for generative AI adoption. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ChatGPT has more than 100 million weekly active users in India, while Anthropic said India accounts for 5.8% of total Claude usage, second only to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Indus serves as a chat interface for its newly announced Sarvam 105B model, the company’s 105-billion-parameter large language model. The app’s launch comes two days after Bengaluru-based Sarvam unveiled its 105B and 30B models at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi earlier this week. At the summit, the startup also outlined enterprise initiatives and hardware plans and announced partnerships with companies including HMD to bring AI to Nokia feature phones and Bosch for AI-enabled automotive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Currently available in beta on iOS, Android, and the web, the Indus app allows users to type or speak queries and receive responses in text and audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google or Microsoft account, or Apple ID, though the service appears to be limited to India for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3095095" height="1007" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/saram-chat-app.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app currently comes with some limitations. Users cannot delete their chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning feature, which can sometimes slow response times. Sarvam has also warned that access may be restricted as it gradually expands its compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first. We will expand access over time,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar wrote on X, adding that the company is seeking feedback from users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners, and Khosla Ventures as it builds large language models tailored for India.&lt;/p&gt;
