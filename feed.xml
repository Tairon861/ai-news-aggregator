Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, like a shark wearing sneakers and a ballerina with a cappuccino for a head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One startup driving this trend is OpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 3 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company recently launched a new “one-click story” feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song’s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor’s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3035544" height="398" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/One-Click-Story-OpenArt.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenArt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While these tools can be beneficial — like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives — there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists’ styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers — such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario — which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June, Disney and Universal sued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another’s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We try to be cautious around the IP infringement,” Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “When you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it’s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3035546" height="369" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Character-OpenArt.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenArt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A problem that a lot of AI couldn’t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video…If you don’t have the same character, then it’s hard to get immersed in the story,” Mao said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it’s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI-generated “brain rot” videos are popping up all over the internet and getting a lot of attention.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft Lens was that type of app: a mobile document scanner that turned paper documents, business cards, receipts, and anything else into easily readable digital files. Now that app is being discontinued, Microsoft says, as it directs its users to its Copilot AI chat app instead.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new support document, Lens will be retired from iOS and Android devices starting on September 15, 2025, then removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play on November 15, 2025. Existing users will be able to continue to use the app’s scanning capabilities through December 15, 2025. After that date, no new scans will be possible, but access to prior scans will remain in the app as long as it stays on the user’s device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First launched in 2015, Microsoft Lens (then known as Office Lens) evolved from an application originally designed for Windows Phone devices. While its core functionality was similar to other mobile scanning applications, it didn’t try to upcharge users for certain functionality or push them into a subscription — a rarity in today’s App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3035556" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-lens.jpeg?w=351" width="351" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead, it performed its task of turning any note — handwritten or otherwise — document, receipt, business card, or even whiteboard scribbles into the file format of your choice, like PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or images. It also offered a variety of built-in filters to enhance the resulting image, lighten the document, turn it into a sharper black-and-white copy, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You could then save the file to one of Microsoft’s apps, other online services, or your camera roll. It was simple, and it worked well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app’s impending shutdown was first spotted by the site Bleeping Computer, which points out that users are being directed to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which lacks all the functionality found in Lens. While Copilot can handle scanning, it doesn’t support saving those scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint, nor does it save business card scans to OneNote. It also lacks Lens’ accessibility features like read-out-loud and Immersive Reader integration, the site notes.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite its age, Lens remains fairly popular, having pulled in over 322,000 downloads on the App Store and Google Play over the past 30 days, according to data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. Since January 2017, it has been downloaded 92.3 million times, the firm’s data shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft has not yet responded to a request for comment on its decision to shut down Lens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Sometimes it’s nice to have a simple app that does one thing well without a lot of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They also asked Altman about the most embarrassing — and perhaps funniest — snafu in the presentation, the “chart crime.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to “think” through answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn’t working as well for them as 4o did.&amp;nbsp;Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed “dumber” was the router wasn’t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,” Altman promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. “We are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Altman also promised, “We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.”&amp;nbsp;This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many “chart crime” jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI's GPT-5 chart crime" class="wp-image-3035581" height="634" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT-5-chart-crime-chart.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-5 “chart crime.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman didn’t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a “mega chart screwup” on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model’s performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was “good example of a GPT-5 failure.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;During a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn’t working as well for them as 4o did.&amp;nbsp;Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed “dumber” was the router wasn’t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,” Altman promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. “We are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And Altman also promised, “We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.”&amp;nbsp;This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many “chart crime” jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenAI's GPT-5 chart crime" class="wp-image-3035581" height="634" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT-5-chart-crime-chart.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-5 “chart crime.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman didn’t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a “mega chart screwup” on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model’s performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was “good example of a GPT-5 failure.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 21:06:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>OpenAI returns old models to ChatGPT as Sam Altman admits ‘bumpy’ GPT-5 rollout (AI News | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-old-models-to-chatgpt-as-sam-altman-admits-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout/</link><description>&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-before" id="boilerplate_2682874"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI co-founder and &lt;strong&gt;CEO Sam Altman is publicly acknowledging major hiccups in yesterday’s rollout of GPT-5&lt;/strong&gt;, the company’s new, flagship large language model (LLM) — advertised as its most powerful and capable yet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answering user questions in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) thread and in a post on X this afternoon, &lt;strong&gt;Altman admitted to a range of issues that have disrupted the launch of GPT-5, including faulty model switching, poor performance, and user confusion&lt;/strong&gt; — prompting OpenAI to partially walk back some of its platform changes and &lt;strong&gt;reinstate user access to earlier models like GPT-4o.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It was a little more bumpy than we hoped for,” Altman wrote&lt;/strong&gt; in reply to a question on Reddit regarding the big GPT-5 launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for erroneous model performance charts shown off during OpenAI’s GPT-5 livestream, Altman said: &lt;strong&gt;“People were working late and were very tired, and human error got in the way.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot comes together for a livestream in the last hours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;GPT-5 rollout updates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*We are going to double GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users as we finish rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*We will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o. We will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*GPT-5 will seem smarter starting…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) August 8, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-problems-with-new-automatic-model-router"&gt;Problems with new automatic model router&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key reason for the trouble according to Altman stems from OpenAI’s new automatic “router” that assigns user prompts to one of four GPT-5 variants — regular, mini, nano, and pro — with an optional “thinking” mode for heavier reasoning tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On X, &lt;strong&gt;Altman revealed that a key part of that system — the autoswitcher — was “out of commission for a chunk of the day,” causing GPT-5 to appear “way dumber” than intended.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, OpenAI says it’s implementing changes to the model decision boundary and will make it more transparent which model is responding to a given query. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A UI update is also on the way to help users manually trigger thinking mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Altman confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will now allow ChatGPT Plus users to continue using GPT-4o — the prior default model&lt;/strong&gt; — after a wave of complaints about GPT-5’s inconsistent performance. He said on Reddit the company is “&lt;strong&gt;trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs” before deciding how long to offer legacy models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet many users including OpenAI beta testers like Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick expressed confused and dismay at &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unilaterally upgrading their ChatGPT experiences to GPT-5 and initially taking away access to the older models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-performance-lags-behind-hype"&gt;Real-world performance lags behind hype&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s internal benchmarks may show GPT-5 leading the pack of LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;, but real-world users are sharing a different experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the launch, users have posted numerous examples of GPT-5 making basic errors in math, logic, and coding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data scientist Colin Fraser posted screenshots of GPT-5 incorrectly solving whether 8.888 repeating equals 9 (it does not, obviously), while another user showed it flubbing a simple algebra problem: 5.9 = x + 5.11.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And still other users reported trouble getting accurate answers to math word problems or using GPT-5 to debug its own presentation charts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developer feedback hasn’t been much better, with &lt;strong&gt;users posting images of GPT faring worse at “one-shot” certain programming tasks&lt;/strong&gt; — completing them well with a single-prompt — &lt;strong&gt;compared to rival AI lab Anthropic’s new model Claude Opus 4.1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And security firm SPLX found GPT-5 still suffers from serious vulnerabilities to prompt injection and obfuscated logic attacks unless its safety layer is hardened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-in-the-spotlight"&gt;OpenAI in the spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT, OpenAI remains the largest player in generative AI by audience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that scale has brought growing pains. Altman noted in his X post that &lt;strong&gt;API traffic doubled over 24 hours following the GPT-5 launch, contributing to platform instability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, OpenAI says it will double rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, and continue to tweak infrastructure as it gathers feedback. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the early missteps — compounded by confusing UX changes and errors in a high-profile launch — have &lt;strong&gt;opened a window for rivals to gain ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pressure is on for OpenAI to prove that GPT-5 isn’t just an incremental update, but a true step forward. Based on the initial rollout, many users aren’t convinced — yet.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI's GPT-5 model went live for most ChatGPT users this week, but lots of people use ChatGPT not through OpenAI's interface but through other platforms or tools. One of the largest deployments is iOS, the iPhone operating system, which allows users to make certain queries via GPT-4o. It turns out those users won't have to wait long for the latest model: Apple will switch to GPT-5 in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26, according to 9to5Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has not officially announced when those OS updates will be released to users' devices, but these major releases have typically been released in September in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model had already rolled out on some other platforms, like the coding tool GitHub Copilot via public preview, as well as Microsoft's general-purpose Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-5 purports to hallucinate 80 percent less and heralds a major rework of how OpenAI positions its models; for example, GPT-5 by default automatically chooses whether to use a reasoning-optimized model based on the nature of the user's prompt. Free users will have to accept whatever the choice is, while paid ChatGPT accounts allow manually picking which model to use on a prompt-by-prompt basis. It's unclear how that will work in iOS; will it stick to GPT-5's non-reasoning mode all the time, or will it utilize&amp;nbsp;GPT-5 "(with thinking)"? And if it supports the latter, will paid ChatGPT users be able to manually pick like they can in the ChatGPT app, or will they be limited to whatever ChatGPT deems appropriate, like free users? We don't know yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the ChatGPT integration in iOS doesn't run all that deep. In most cases, LLM-related features built into iOS and macOS use Apple's own models, which live under the Apple Intelligence branding umbrella. But it gives users the choice of referring a prompt to ChatGPT on a case-by-case basis when the prompt is outside the scope of what Apple's models are designed for. GPT-5 is a vastly more powerful model than anything under Apple Intelligence; many of Apple's models run locally and have a fraction of the parameters (around 3 billion to GPT-5's more than 500 billion), making them more prone to errors and limited in their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that Apple will completely rethink how ChatGPT is integrated with GPT-5, but the company has more AI-related moves planned in the future, so 2026's OS updates could be another story.&lt;/p&gt;

The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI-powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT-5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic’s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic’s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-anthropic-s-claude-became-the-developer-s-ai-assistant-of-choice"&gt;How Anthropic’s Claude became the developer’s AI assistant of choice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI-powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence’s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market — more than double OpenAI’s 21% share — according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic’s remaining business has grown more than eleven-fold year-over-year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claude’s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI’s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub have praised Claude’s ability to handle multi-step coding problems and understand large codebases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,” said Logan Graham, a member of Anthropic’s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI-assisted development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft, represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor’s key product while relying on that same competitor’s parent company for a significant portion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-strikes-back-with-aggressive-gpt-5-pricing-strategy-targeting-anthropic"&gt;OpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT-5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic’s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT-5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude’s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic’s rapid revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion. Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic’s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures, as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI’s 25% and Google’s 20%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT-5’s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration — exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic’s customer concentration so risky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-push-beyond-coding-into-enterprise-markets"&gt;Anthropic’s push beyond coding into enterprise markets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer, United Airlines, and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s business-to-business revenue run rate has grown seventeen-fold year-over-year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet the coding market remains central to Anthropic’s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,” Graham recently told VentureBeat. “The only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-customer-concentration-creates-high-stakes-dependencies"&gt;Anthropic’s customer concentration creates high-stakes dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high-volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic’s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT-5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-talent-wars-and-competitive-dynamics-reshaping-ai"&gt;The talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI’s aggressive GPT-5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near-term revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers, maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the pricing pressure from GPT-5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company’s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI’s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements — with new versions launching monthly rather than annually — provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI’s pricing offensive. The company’s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend beyond any single company’s fortunes. As AI-powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy’s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:shortcode --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company’s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company’s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI-powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT-5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic’s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic’s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-anthropic-s-claude-became-the-developer-s-ai-assistant-of-choice"&gt;How Anthropic’s Claude became the developer’s AI assistant of choice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI-powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence’s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market — more than double OpenAI’s 21% share — according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic’s remaining business has grown more than eleven-fold year-over-year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claude’s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI’s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub have praised Claude’s ability to handle multi-step coding problems and understand large codebases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,” said Logan Graham, a member of Anthropic’s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI-assisted development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft, represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor’s key product while relying on that same competitor’s parent company for a significant portion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-strikes-back-with-aggressive-gpt-5-pricing-strategy-targeting-anthropic"&gt;OpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT-5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic’s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT-5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude’s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic’s rapid revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion. Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic’s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures, as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI’s 25% and Google’s 20%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT-5’s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration — exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic’s customer concentration so risky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-push-beyond-coding-into-enterprise-markets"&gt;Anthropic’s push beyond coding into enterprise markets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer, United Airlines, and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s business-to-business revenue run rate has grown seventeen-fold year-over-year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet the coding market remains central to Anthropic’s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,” Graham recently told VentureBeat. “The only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anthropic-s-customer-concentration-creates-high-stakes-dependencies"&gt;Anthropic’s customer concentration creates high-stakes dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high-volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic’s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT-5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
