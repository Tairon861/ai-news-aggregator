&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sources told Wired that OpenAI was connecting Claude to internal tools that allowed the company to compare Claude’s performance to its own models in categories like coding, writing, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Anthropic spokesperson said, “OpenAI’s own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5,” which is apparently “a direct violation of our terms of service.” (Anthropic’s commercial terms forbid companies from using Claude to build competing services.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the company also said it would continue to give OpenAI access for “for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, a statement of its own, an OpenAI spokesperson described its usage as “industry standard” and added, “While we respect Anthropic’s decision to cut off our API access, it’s disappointing considering our API remains available to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic executives had already shown resistance to providing access to competitors, with Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously justifying the company’s decision to cut off Windsurf (a rumored OpenAI acquisition target, subsequently acquired by Cognition) by saying, “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/YouTube-Thumb-Text-2-3.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic has revoked OpenAI’s access to its Claude family of AI models, according to a report in Wired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The meeting came after an earnings call in which Cook told investors and analysts that Apple would “significantly” increase its AI investments. It seems he had a similar message for Apple employees, reportedly telling them, “Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite launching a variety of AI-powered features in the past year under the Apple Intelligence umbrella, the company’s promised upgrades to its voice assistant Siri have been significantly delayed. And Cook seemed to acknowledge that the company has fallen behind its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve rarely been first,” he reportedly said. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.” But in his telling, that didn’t stop Apple from inventing the “modern” versions of those products.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224174932.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook held an hourlong all-hands meeting in which he told employees that the company needs to win in AI, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.&lt;/p&gt;
