The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she’d no longer be able to enter the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At first, she couldn’t find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_3"&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the people targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was an escalation in the Trump administration’s war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won’t be the last people targeted in this way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it’s the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration’s actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends’ accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team’s salaries—and buy their families’ groceries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We’re running against time to take the appropriate measures.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Helping navigate “a lawless place”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid’s support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;HateAid gets caught in Trump World's dragnet&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like X.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who gets to define—and experience—free speech&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else's speech is challenged, there's a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have more information on this story or a tip for something else that we should report? Using a non-work device, reach the reporter on Signal at eileenguo.15 or tips@technologyreview.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users' ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Sona contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This article originally misstated the name of Germany's far right party. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hateaid_new4f.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection.

Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;HateAid gets caught in Trump World's dragnet&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like X.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who gets to define—and experience—free speech&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else's speech is challenged, there's a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have more information on this story or a tip for something else that we should report? Using a non-work device, reach the reporter on Signal at eileenguo.15 or tips@technologyreview.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users' ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin Sona contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This article originally misstated the name of Germany's far right party. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/19/1131384/what-its-like-to-be-banned-from-the-us-for-fighting-online-hate/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>JPMorgan Chase treats AI spending as core infrastructure (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-treats-ai-spending-as-core-infrastructure/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Inside large banks, artificial intelligence has moved into a category once reserved for payment systems, data centres, and core risk controls. At JPMorgan Chase, AI is framed as infrastructure the bank believes it cannot afford to neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That position came through clearly in recent comments from CEO Jamie Dimon, who defended the bank’s rising technology budget and warned that institutions that fall behind on AI risk losing ground to competitors. The argument was not about replacing people but about staying functional in an industry where speed, scale, and cost discipline matter every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been investing heavily in technology for years, but AI has changed the tone of that spending. What once sat with innovation projects is now folded into the bank’s baseline operating costs. That includes internal AI tools that support research, document drafting, internal reviews, and other routine tasks in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From experimentation to infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in language reflects a deeper change in how the bank views risk. AI is considered part of the systems required to keep pace with competitors that are automating internal work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than encouraging workers to rely on public AI systems, JPMorgan has focused on building and governing its own internal platforms. That decision reflects long-held concerns in banking about data exposure, client confidentiality, and regulatory monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks operate in an environment where mistakes carry high costs. Any system that touches sensitive data or influences choices must be auditable and explainable. Public AI tools, trained on datasets and updated frequently, make that difficult. Internal systems give JPMorgan more control, even if they take longer to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach also reduces the potential of uncontrolled “shadow AI,” in which employees use unapproved tools to speed up work. While such tools can improve productivity, they create gaps in oversight that regulators tend to notice quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A cautious approach to workforce change&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been careful in how it talks about AI’s impact on jobs. The bank has avoided claims that AI will dramatically reduce headcount. Instead, it presents AI as a way to reduce manual work and improve consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks that once required multiple review cycles can now be completed faster, with employees still responsible for final judgement. The framing positions AI as support not substitution, which matters in a sector sensitive to political and regulatory reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the organisation makes this approach practical. JPMorgan employs hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Even tiny efficiency gains, applied broadly, can translate into meaningful cost savings over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upfront investment required to build and maintain internal AI systems is substantial. Dimon acknowledges that technology spending can have an impact on short-term performance, especially when market conditions are uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His response is that cutting back on technology now may improve margins in the near term, but it risks weakening the bank’s position later. In that sense, AI spending is treated as a form of insurance against falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JPMorgan, AI, and the risk of falling behind rivals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan’s stance reflects pressure in the banking sector. Rivals are investing in AI to speed up fraud detection, streamline compliance work, and improve internal reporting. As these tools become more common, expectations rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators may assume banks have access to advanced monitoring systems. Clients may expect faster responses and fewer errors. In that environment, lagging on AI can look less like caution and more like mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has not suggested that AI will solve structural challenges or eliminate risk. Many AI projects struggle to move beyond narrow uses, and integrating them into complex systems remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harder work lies in governance. Deciding which teams can use AI, under what conditions, and with what oversight requires clear rules. Errors need defined escalation paths. Responsibility must be assigned when systems produce flawed output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across large enterprises, AI adoption is not limited by access to models or computing power, but constrained by process, policy, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other end-user companies, JPMorgan’s approach offers a useful reference point. AI is treated as part of the machinery that keeps the organisation running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not guarantee success. Returns may take years to appear, and some investments will not pay off. But the bank’s position is that the greater risk lies in doing too little, not too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by IKECHUKWU JULIUS UGWU)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Banks operationalise as Plumery AI launches standardised integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Uniphore-chart.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Source: Compiled by MIT Technology Review Insights with data from Informatica, CDO Insights 2025 report, 2026&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In partnership with&lt;/span&gt;Uniphore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption.

In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The concept to production reality&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131431" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Uniphore-chart.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Source: Compiled by MIT Technology Review Insights with data from Informatica, CDO Insights 2025 report, 2026&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/19/1131422/going-beyond-pilots-with-composable-and-sovereign-ai/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:59:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>10 things I learned from burning myself out with AI coding agents (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn’t polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today’s AI coding agents feel much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, I have used Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI’s Codex in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I’ll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my Apple II Plus when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic’s premium AI plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people’s code for my needs. Since 1990, I’ve programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude Code, Codex, and Google’s Gemini CLI, can seemingly perform software miracles on a small scale. They can spit out flashy prototypes of simple applications, user interfaces, and even games, but only as long as they borrow patterns from their training data. Much like a 3D printer, doing production-level work takes far more effort. Creating durable production code, managing a complex project, or crafting something truly novel still requires experience, patience, and skill beyond what today’s AI agents can provide on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet these tools have opened a world of creative potential in software that was previously closed to me, and they feel personally empowering. Even with that impression, though, I know these are hobby projects, and the limitations of coding agents lead me to believe that veteran software developers probably shouldn’t fear losing their jobs to these tools any time soon. In fact, they may become busier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have created over 50 demo projects in the past two months, fueled in part by a bout of COVID that left me bedridden with a laptop and a generous 2x Claude usage cap that Anthropic put in place during the last few weeks of December. As I typed furiously all day, my wife kept asking me, “Who are you talking to?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a few of the more interesting results listed on my personal website. Here are 10 interesting things I’ve learned from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. People are still necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the best AI coding agents available today, humans remain essential to the software development process. Experienced human software developers bring judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge that AI models lack. They know how to architect systems for long-term maintainability, how to balance technical debt against feature velocity, and when to push back when requirements don’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hobby projects like mine, I can get away with a lot of sloppiness. But for production work, having someone who understands version control, incremental backups, testing one feature at a time, and debugging complex interactions between systems makes all the difference. Knowing something about how good software development works helps a lot when guiding an AI coding agent—the tool amplifies your existing knowledge rather than replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As independent AI researcher Simon Willison wrote in a post distinguishing serious AI-assisted development from casual “vibe coding,” “AI tools amplify existing expertise. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI assistance, you don’t have to remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do everything. You just need to know what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I like to remind myself that coding agents are software tools best used to enact human ideas, not autonomous coding employees. They are not people (and not people replacements) no matter how the companies behind them might market them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, everything you do on a computer was once a manual process. Programming a computer like the ENIAC involved literally making physical bits (connections) with wire on a plugboard. The history of programming has been one of increasing automation, so even though this AI-assisted leap is somewhat startling, one could think of these tools as an advancement similar to the advent of high-level languages, automated compilers and debugger tools, or GUI-based IDEs. They can automate many tasks, but managing the overarching project scope still falls to the person telling the tool what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they can have rapidly compounding benefits. I’ve now used AI tools to write better tools—such as changing the source of an emulator so a coding agent can use it directly—and those improved tools are already having ripple effects. But a human must be in the loop for the best execution of my vision. This approach has kept me very busy, and contrary to some prevailing fears about people becoming dumber due to AI, I have learned many new things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. AI models are brittle beyond their training data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all AI models based on the Transformer architecture, the large language models (LLMs) that underpin today’s coding agents have a significant limitation: They can only reliably apply knowledge gleaned from training data, and they have a limited ability to generalize that knowledge to novel domains not represented in that data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;What is training data? In this case, when building coding-flavored LLMs, AI companies download millions of examples of software code from sources like GitHub and use them to make the AI models. Companies later specialize them for coding through fine-tuning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of AI agents to use trial and error—attempting something and then trying again—helps mitigate the brittleness of LLMs somewhat. But it’s not perfect, and it can be frustrating to see a coding agent spin its wheels trying and failing at a task repeatedly, either because it doesn’t know how to do it or because it previously learned how to solve a problem but then forgot because the context window got compacted (more on that here).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this, it helps to have the AI model take copious notes as it goes along about how it solved certain problems so that future instances of the agent can learn from them again. You also want to set ground rules in the claude.md file that the agent reads when it begins its session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brittleness means that coding agents are almost frighteningly good at what they’ve been trained and fine-tuned on—modern programming languages, JavaScript, HTML, and similar well-represented technologies—and generally terrible at tasks on which they have not been deeply trained, such as 6502 Assembly or programming an Atari 800 game with authentic-looking character graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me five minutes to make a nice HTML5 demo with Claude but a week of torturous trial and error, plus actual systematic design on my part, to make a similar demo of an Atari 800 game. To do so, I had to use Claude Code to invent several tools, like command-line emulators and MCP servers, that allow it to peek into the operation of the Atari 800’s memory and chipset to even begin to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. True novelty can be an uphill battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to what might poetically be called “preconceived notions” baked into a coding model’s neural network (more technically, statistical semantic associations), it can be difficult to get AI agents to create truly novel things, even if you carefully spell out what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I spent four days trying to get Claude Code to create an Atari 800 version of my HTML game &lt;em&gt;Violent Checkers&lt;/em&gt;, but it had trouble because in the game’s design, the squares on the checkerboard don’t matter beyond their starting positions. No matter how many times I told the agent (and made notes in my Claude project files), it would come back to trying to center the pieces to the squares, snap them within squares, or use the squares as a logical basis of the game’s calculations when they should really just form a background image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this in the Atari 800 version, I started over and told Claude that I was creating a game with a UFO (instead of a circular checker piece) flying over a field of adjacent squares—never once mentioning the words “checker,” “checkerboard,” or “checkers.” With that approach, I got the results I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2135908 align-center"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;
          &lt;div class="ars-lightbox-item"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because with LLMs, context is everything, and in language, context changes meaning. Take the word “bank” and add the words “river” or “central” in front of it, and see how the meaning changes. In a way, words act as addresses that unlock the semantic relationships encoded in a neural network. So if you put “checkerboard” and “game” in the context, the model’s self-attention process links up a massive web of semantic associations about how checkers games should work, and that semantic baggage throws things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of tricks can help AI coders navigate around these limitations. First, avoid contaminating the context with irrelevant information. Second, when the agent gets stuck, try this prompt: “What information do you need that would let you implement this perfectly right now? What tools are available to you that you could use to discover that information systematically without guessing?” This forces the agent to identify (semantically link up) its own knowledge gaps, spelled out in the context window and subject to future action, instead of flailing around blindly.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;4. The 90 percent problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 90 percent of an AI coding project comes in fast and amazes you. The last 10 percent involves tediously filling in the details through back-and-forth trial-and-error conversation with the agent. Tasks that require deeper insight or understanding than what the agent can provide still require humans to make the connections and guide it in the right direction. The limitations we discussed above can also cause your project to hit a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I have observed over the years, larger LLMs can potentially make deeper contextual connections than smaller ones. They have more parameters (encoded data points), and those parameters are linked in more multidimensional ways, so they tend to have a deeper map of semantic relationships. As deep as those go, it seems that human brains still have an even deeper grasp of semantic connections and can make wild semantic jumps that LLMs tend not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity, in this sense, may be when you jump from, say, basketball to how bubbles form in soap film and somehow make a useful connection that leads to a breakthrough. Instead, LLMs tend to follow conventional semantic paths that are more conservative and entirely guided by mapped-out relationships from the training data. That limits their creative potential unless the prompter unlocks it by guiding the LLM to make novel semantic connections. That takes skill and creativity on the part of the operator, which once again shows the role of LLMs as tools used by humans rather than independent thinking machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Feature creep becomes irresistible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While creating software with AI coding tools, the joy of experiencing novelty makes you want to keep adding interesting new features rather than fixing bugs or perfecting existing systems. And Claude (or Codex) is happy to oblige, churning away at new ideas that are easy to sketch out in a quick and pleasing demo (the 90 percent problem again) rather than polishing the code.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing bugs can also create bugs elsewhere. This is not new to coding agents—it’s a time-honored problem in software development. But agents supercharge this phenomenon because they can barrel through your code and make sweeping changes in pursuit of narrow-minded goals that affect lots of working systems. We’ve already talked about the importance of having a good architecture guided by the human mind behind the wheel above, and that comes into play here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. AGI is not here yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the limitations I’ve described above, it’s very clear that an AI model with general intelligence—what people usually call artificial general intelligence (AGI)—is still not here. AGI would hypothetically be able to navigate around baked-in stereotype associations and not have to rely on explicit training or fine-tuning on many examples to get things right. AI companies will probably need a different architecture in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m speculating, but AGI would likely need to learn permanently on the fly—as in modify its own neural network weights—instead of relying on what is called “in-context learning,” which only persists until the context fills up and gets compacted or wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2135921 align-center"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;
          &lt;div class="ars-lightbox-item"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you could teach a true AGI system how to do something by explanation or let it learn by doing, noting successes, and having those lessons permanently stick, no matter what is in the context window. Today’s coding agents can’t do that—they forget lessons from earlier in a long session or between sessions unless you manually document everything for them. My favorite trick is instructing them to write a long, detailed report on what happened when a bug is fixed. That way, you can point to the hard-earned solution the next time the amnestic AI model makes the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Even fast isn’t fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using Claude Code for a while, it’s easy to take for granted that you suddenly have the power to create software without knowing certain programming languages. This is amazing at first, but you can quickly become frustrated that what is conventionally a very fast development process isn’t fast enough. Impatience at the coding machine sets in, and you start wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But even if you do know the programming languages being used, you don’t get a free pass. You still need to make key decisions about how the project will unfold. And when the agent gets stuck or makes a mess of things, your programming knowledge becomes essential for diagnosing what went wrong and steering it back on course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. People may become busier than ever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After guiding way too many hobby projects through Claude Code over the past two months, I’m starting to think that most people won’t become unemployed due to AI—they will become busier than ever. Power tools allow more work to be done in less time, and the economy will demand more productivity to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost too easy to make new software, in fact, and that can be exhausting. One project idea would lead to another, and I was soon spending eight hours a day during my winter vacation shepherding about 15 Claude Code projects at once. That’s too much split attention for good results, but the novelty of seeing my ideas come to life was addictive. In addition to the game ideas I’ve mentioned here, I made tools that scrape and search my past articles, a graphical MUD based on ZZT, a new type of MUSH (text game) that uses AI-generated rooms, a new type of Telnet display proxy, and a Claude Code client for the Apple II (more on that soon). I also put two AI-enabled emulators for Apple II and Atari 800&amp;nbsp;on GitHub. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the advent of the steam shovel, which allowed humans to dig holes faster than a team using hand shovels. It made existing projects faster and new projects possible. But think about the human operator of the steam shovel. Suddenly, we had a tireless tool that could work 24 hours a day if fueled up and maintained properly, while the human piloting it would need to eat, sleep, and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines over 100 years ago. Humans need rest, even when machines don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will an AI system ever replace the human role here? Even if AI coding agents could eventually work fully autonomously, I don’t think they’ll replace humans entirely because there will still be people who want to get things done, and new AI power tools will emerge to help them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Fast is scary to people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools can turn what was once a year-long personal project into a five-minute session. I fed Claude Code a photo of a two-player Tetris game I sketched in a notebook back in 2008, and it produced a working prototype in minutes (prompt: “create a fully-featured web game with sound effects based on this diagram”). That’s wild, and even though the results are imperfect, it’s a bit frightening to comprehend what kind of sea change in software development this might entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since early December, I’ve been posting some of my more amusing experimental AI-coded projects to Bluesky for people to try out, but I discovered I needed to deliberately slow down with updates because they came too fast for people to absorb (and too fast for me to fully test). I’ve also received comments like “I’m worried you’re using AI, you’re making games too fast” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my own habits, the flow of new software will not slow down. There will soon be a seemingly endless supply of AI-augmented media (games, movies, images, books), and that’s a problem we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. These products won’t all be “AI slop,” either; some will be done very well, and the acceleration in production times due to these new power tools will balloon the quantity beyond anything we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media tends to prime people to believe that AI is all good or all bad, but that kind of black-and-white thinking may be the easy way out. You’ll have no cognitive dissonance, but you’ll miss a far richer third option: seeing these tools as imperfect and deserving of critique but also as useful and empowering when they bring your ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents should be considered tools, not entities or employees, and they should be amplifiers of human ideas. My game-in-progress &lt;em&gt;Card Miner&lt;/em&gt; is entirely my own high-level creative design work, but the AI model handled the low-level code. I am still proud of it as an expression of my personal ideas, and it would not exist without AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. These tools aren’t going away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, coding agents remain very much tools in the hands of people who want to build things. The question is whether humans will learn to wield these new tools effectively to empower themselves. Based on two months of intensive experimentation, I’d say the answer is a qualified yes, with plenty of caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have social issues to face: Professional developers already use these tools, and with the prevailing stigma against AI tools in some online communities, many software developers and the platforms that host their work will face difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I don’t think AI tools will make human software designers obsolete. Instead, they may well help those designers become more capable. This isn’t new, of course; tools of every kind have been serving this role since long before the dawn of recorded history. The best tools amplify human capability while keeping a person behind the wheel. The 3D printer analogy holds: amazing fast results are possible, but mastery still takes time, skill, and a lot of patience with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn’t polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today’s AI coding agents feel much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, I have used Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI’s Codex in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I’ll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my Apple II Plus when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic’s premium AI plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people’s code for my needs. Since 1990, I’ve programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude Code, Codex, and Google’s Gemini CLI, can seemingly perform software miracles on a small scale. They can spit out flashy prototypes of simple applications, user interfaces, and even games, but only as long as they borrow patterns from their training data. Much like a 3D printer, doing production-level work takes far more effort. Creating durable production code, managing a complex project, or crafting something truly novel still requires experience, patience, and skill beyond what today’s AI agents can provide on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet these tools have opened a world of creative potential in software that was previously closed to me, and they feel personally empowering. Even with that impression, though, I know these are hobby projects, and the limitations of coding agents lead me to believe that veteran software developers probably shouldn’t fear losing their jobs to these tools any time soon. In fact, they may become busier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have created over 50 demo projects in the past two months, fueled in part by a bout of COVID that left me bedridden with a laptop and a generous 2x Claude usage cap that Anthropic put in place during the last few weeks of December. As I typed furiously all day, my wife kept asking me, “Who are you talking to?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a few of the more interesting results listed on my personal website. Here are 10 interesting things I’ve learned from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. People are still necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the best AI coding agents available today, humans remain essential to the software development process. Experienced human software developers bring judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge that AI models lack. They know how to architect systems for long-term maintainability, how to balance technical debt against feature velocity, and when to push back when requirements don’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hobby projects like mine, I can get away with a lot of sloppiness. But for production work, having someone who understands version control, incremental backups, testing one feature at a time, and debugging complex interactions between systems makes all the difference. Knowing something about how good software development works helps a lot when guiding an AI coding agent—the tool amplifies your existing knowledge rather than replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As independent AI researcher Simon Willison wrote in a post distinguishing serious AI-assisted development from casual “vibe coding,” “AI tools amplify existing expertise. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI assistance, you don’t have to remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do everything. You just need to know what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I like to remind myself that coding agents are software tools best used to enact human ideas, not autonomous coding employees. They are not people (and not people replacements) no matter how the companies behind them might market them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, everything you do on a computer was once a manual process. Programming a computer like the ENIAC involved literally making physical bits (connections) with wire on a plugboard. The history of programming has been one of increasing automation, so even though this AI-assisted leap is somewhat startling, one could think of these tools as an advancement similar to the advent of high-level languages, automated compilers and debugger tools, or GUI-based IDEs. They can automate many tasks, but managing the overarching project scope still falls to the person telling the tool what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they can have rapidly compounding benefits. I’ve now used AI tools to write better tools—such as changing the source of an emulator so a coding agent can use it directly—and those improved tools are already having ripple effects. But a human must be in the loop for the best execution of my vision. This approach has kept me very busy, and contrary to some prevailing fears about people becoming dumber due to AI, I have learned many new things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. AI models are brittle beyond their training data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all AI models based on the Transformer architecture, the large language models (LLMs) that underpin today’s coding agents have a significant limitation: They can only reliably apply knowledge gleaned from training data, and they have a limited ability to generalize that knowledge to novel domains not represented in that data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;What is training data? In this case, when building coding-flavored LLMs, AI companies download millions of examples of software code from sources like GitHub and use them to make the AI models. Companies later specialize them for coding through fine-tuning processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of AI agents to use trial and error—attempting something and then trying again—helps mitigate the brittleness of LLMs somewhat. But it’s not perfect, and it can be frustrating to see a coding agent spin its wheels trying and failing at a task repeatedly, either because it doesn’t know how to do it or because it previously learned how to solve a problem but then forgot because the context window got compacted (more on that here).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this, it helps to have the AI model take copious notes as it goes along about how it solved certain problems so that future instances of the agent can learn from them again. You also want to set ground rules in the claude.md file that the agent reads when it begins its session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brittleness means that coding agents are almost frighteningly good at what they’ve been trained and fine-tuned on—modern programming languages, JavaScript, HTML, and similar well-represented technologies—and generally terrible at tasks on which they have not been deeply trained, such as 6502 Assembly or programming an Atari 800 game with authentic-looking character graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me five minutes to make a nice HTML5 demo with Claude but a week of torturous trial and error, plus actual systematic design on my part, to make a similar demo of an Atari 800 game. To do so, I had to use Claude Code to invent several tools, like command-line emulators and MCP servers, that allow it to peek into the operation of the Atari 800’s memory and chipset to even begin to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. True novelty can be an uphill battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to what might poetically be called “preconceived notions” baked into a coding model’s neural network (more technically, statistical semantic associations), it can be difficult to get AI agents to create truly novel things, even if you carefully spell out what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I spent four days trying to get Claude Code to create an Atari 800 version of my HTML game &lt;em&gt;Violent Checkers&lt;/em&gt;, but it had trouble because in the game’s design, the squares on the checkerboard don’t matter beyond their starting positions. No matter how many times I told the agent (and made notes in my Claude project files), it would come back to trying to center the pieces to the squares, snap them within squares, or use the squares as a logical basis of the game’s calculations when they should really just form a background image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this in the Atari 800 version, I started over and told Claude that I was creating a game with a UFO (instead of a circular checker piece) flying over a field of adjacent squares—never once mentioning the words “checker,” “checkerboard,” or “checkers.” With that approach, I got the results I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because with LLMs, context is everything, and in language, context changes meaning. Take the word “bank” and add the words “river” or “central” in front of it, and see how the meaning changes. In a way, words act as addresses that unlock the semantic relationships encoded in a neural network. So if you put “checkerboard” and “game” in the context, the model’s self-attention process links up a massive web of semantic associations about how checkers games should work, and that semantic baggage throws things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of tricks can help AI coders navigate around these limitations. First, avoid contaminating the context with irrelevant information. Second, when the agent gets stuck, try this prompt: “What information do you need that would let you implement this perfectly right now? What tools are available to you that you could use to discover that information systematically without guessing?” This forces the agent to identify (semantically link up) its own knowledge gaps, spelled out in the context window and subject to future action, instead of flailing around blindly.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;4. The 90 percent problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 90 percent of an AI coding project comes in fast and amazes you. The last 10 percent involves tediously filling in the details through back-and-forth trial-and-error conversation with the agent. Tasks that require deeper insight or understanding than what the agent can provide still require humans to make the connections and guide it in the right direction. The limitations we discussed above can also cause your project to hit a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I have observed over the years, larger LLMs can potentially make deeper contextual connections than smaller ones. They have more parameters (encoded data points), and those parameters are linked in more multidimensional ways, so they tend to have a deeper map of semantic relationships. As deep as those go, it seems that human brains still have an even deeper grasp of semantic connections and can make wild semantic jumps that LLMs tend not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity, in this sense, may be when you jump from, say, basketball to how bubbles form in soap film and somehow make a useful connection that leads to a breakthrough. Instead, LLMs tend to follow conventional semantic paths that are more conservative and entirely guided by mapped-out relationships from the training data. That limits their creative potential unless the prompter unlocks it by guiding the LLM to make novel semantic connections. That takes skill and creativity on the part of the operator, which once again shows the role of LLMs as tools used by humans rather than independent thinking machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Feature creep becomes irresistible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While creating software with AI coding tools, the joy of experiencing novelty makes you want to keep adding interesting new features rather than fixing bugs or perfecting existing systems. And Claude (or Codex) is happy to oblige, churning away at new ideas that are easy to sketch out in a quick and pleasing demo (the 90 percent problem again) rather than polishing the code.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing bugs can also create bugs elsewhere. This is not new to coding agents—it’s a time-honored problem in software development. But agents supercharge this phenomenon because they can barrel through your code and make sweeping changes in pursuit of narrow-minded goals that affect lots of working systems. We’ve already talked about the importance of having a good architecture guided by the human mind behind the wheel above, and that comes into play here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. AGI is not here yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the limitations I’ve described above, it’s very clear that an AI model with general intelligence—what people usually call artificial general intelligence (AGI)—is still not here. AGI would hypothetically be able to navigate around baked-in stereotype associations and not have to rely on explicit training or fine-tuning on many examples to get things right. AI companies will probably need a different architecture in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m speculating, but AGI would likely need to learn permanently on the fly—as in modify its own neural network weights—instead of relying on what is called “in-context learning,” which only persists until the context fills up and gets compacted or wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2135921 align-center"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you could teach a true AGI system how to do something by explanation or let it learn by doing, noting successes, and having those lessons permanently stick, no matter what is in the context window. Today’s coding agents can’t do that—they forget lessons from earlier in a long session or between sessions unless you manually document everything for them. My favorite trick is instructing them to write a long, detailed report on what happened when a bug is fixed. That way, you can point to the hard-earned solution the next time the amnestic AI model makes the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Even fast isn’t fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using Claude Code for a while, it’s easy to take for granted that you suddenly have the power to create software without knowing certain programming languages. This is amazing at first, but you can quickly become frustrated that what is conventionally a very fast development process isn’t fast enough. Impatience at the coding machine sets in, and you start wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But even if you do know the programming languages being used, you don’t get a free pass. You still need to make key decisions about how the project will unfold. And when the agent gets stuck or makes a mess of things, your programming knowledge becomes essential for diagnosing what went wrong and steering it back on course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. People may become busier than ever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After guiding way too many hobby projects through Claude Code over the past two months, I’m starting to think that most people won’t become unemployed due to AI—they will become busier than ever. Power tools allow more work to be done in less time, and the economy will demand more productivity to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost too easy to make new software, in fact, and that can be exhausting. One project idea would lead to another, and I was soon spending eight hours a day during my winter vacation shepherding about 15 Claude Code projects at once. That’s too much split attention for good results, but the novelty of seeing my ideas come to life was addictive. In addition to the game ideas I’ve mentioned here, I made tools that scrape and search my past articles, a graphical MUD based on ZZT, a new type of MUSH (text game) that uses AI-generated rooms, a new type of Telnet display proxy, and a Claude Code client for the Apple II (more on that soon). I also put two AI-enabled emulators for Apple II and Atari 800&amp;nbsp;on GitHub. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the advent of the steam shovel, which allowed humans to dig holes faster than a team using hand shovels. It made existing projects faster and new projects possible. But think about the human operator of the steam shovel. Suddenly, we had a tireless tool that could work 24 hours a day if fueled up and maintained properly, while the human piloting it would need to eat, sleep, and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines over 100 years ago. Humans need rest, even when machines don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will an AI system ever replace the human role here? Even if AI coding agents could eventually work fully autonomously, I don’t think they’ll replace humans entirely because there will still be people who want to get things done, and new AI power tools will emerge to help them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Fast is scary to people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools can turn what was once a year-long personal project into a five-minute session. I fed Claude Code a photo of a two-player Tetris game I sketched in a notebook back in 2008, and it produced a working prototype in minutes (prompt: “create a fully-featured web game with sound effects based on this diagram”). That’s wild, and even though the results are imperfect, it’s a bit frightening to comprehend what kind of sea change in software development this might entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since early December, I’ve been posting some of my more amusing experimental AI-coded projects to Bluesky for people to try out, but I discovered I needed to deliberately slow down with updates because they came too fast for people to absorb (and too fast for me to fully test). I’ve also received comments like “I’m worried you’re using AI, you’re making games too fast” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my own habits, the flow of new software will not slow down. There will soon be a seemingly endless supply of AI-augmented media (games, movies, images, books), and that’s a problem we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. These products won’t all be “AI slop,” either; some will be done very well, and the acceleration in production times due to these new power tools will balloon the quantity beyond anything we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media tends to prime people to believe that AI is all good or all bad, but that kind of black-and-white thinking may be the easy way out. You’ll have no cognitive dissonance, but you’ll miss a far richer third option: seeing these tools as imperfect and deserving of critique but also as useful and empowering when they bring your ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI agents should be considered tools, not entities or employees, and they should be amplifiers of human ideas. My game-in-progress &lt;em&gt;Card Miner&lt;/em&gt; is entirely my own high-level creative design work, but the AI model handled the low-level code. I am still proud of it as an expression of my personal ideas, and it would not exist without AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. These tools aren’t going away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, coding agents remain very much tools in the hands of people who want to build things. The question is whether humans will learn to wield these new tools effectively to empower themselves. Based on two months of intensive experimentation, I’d say the answer is a qualified yes, with plenty of caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have social issues to face: Professional developers already use these tools, and with the prevailing stigma against AI tools in some online communities, many software developers and the platforms that host their work will face difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I don’t think AI tools will make human software designers obsolete. Instead, they may well help those designers become more capable. This isn’t new, of course; tools of every kind have been serving this role since long before the dawn of recorded history. The best tools amplify human capability while keeping a person behind the wheel. The 3D printer analogy holds: amazing fast results are possible, but mastery still takes time, skill, and a lot of patience with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

In banking, payments, and wealth management, to name but three sub-sectors, AI is now embedded in budgeting tools, fraud detection systems, KYC, AML, and customer engagement platforms. Credit unions sit in this broader fintech transformation, facing similar technological pressures and operating under distinct cooperative models built on trust, proffered services in competitive markets, and community alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer behaviour suggests AI is already part of everyday financial decision-making. Research from Velera indicates that 55% of consumers use AI tools for financial planning or budgeting, while 42% are comfortable using AI to complete financial transactions. Adoption is highest among younger demographics, with 80% of Gen Z and younger millennials using AI for financial planning and close to that proportion expressing ‘comfort’ with agentic AI. These patterns mirror trends in the wider fintech sector, where AI-driven personal finance tools and conversational interfaces have become more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a particular a dual challenge for credit unions. Member expectations are shaped by large fintech companies’ digital platforms and apps, and large digital banks are deploying AI at scale. At the average Union, internal readiness remains limited. A CULytics survey shows that although 42% of credit unions have implemented AI in specific operational areas, only 8% report using it in multiple parts of the business. The gap between market expectations and institutional ability defines the current phase of AI adoption in the cooperative-based financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI as a trust-based extension of financial services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike many fintech startups, credit unions benefit from high levels of consumer trust. Velera reports that 85% of consumers see credit unions as reliable sources of financial advice, and 63% of CU members say they would attend AI-related educational sessions if such were offered. These findings position credit unions as being able to frame AI as an advisory tool to be embedded in existing relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fintech, “explainable AI” and transparent digital finance are mainstays as identity verification, and regulation watch the technology closely. Regulators and consumers clearly expect transparency into how decisions are made by AI back ends. Credit unions can use this expectation by integrating AI into education programmes, fraud awareness efforts and financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where AI delivers tangible value&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personalisation is a leading use case for AI. Machine learning models let financial institutions move beyond static customer segmentation, via behavioural signals and life-stage indicators. The approach is already common in other sectors, and in the industry, in fintech lending and digital banking platforms. Credit unions can adopt similar techniques, ones that tailor offers, communications, and make product recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Member service represents another potential high-impact area. According to CULytics, 58% of credit unions now use chatbots or virtual assistants, the most-adopted AI application in the sector. Cornerstone Advisors reports that deployment is accelerating among credit unions than banks, using AI to handle routine enquiries and preserve staff capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fraud prevention has emerged as an AI use case in the sector. Alloy reports a 92% net increase in AI fraud prevention investment among credit unions in 2025, compared with lower prioritisation among banks. As digital payments get more widely-adopted, AI-driven fraud detection is important to balance security with low-friction user experiences. In this respect, credit unions face the same pressures as mainstream fintech payment providers and neobanks, where false declines and delayed responses can directly erode customer trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operational efficiency and lending decisions also feature prominently. Research from Inclind and CULytics shows AI being applied to reconciliation, underwriting, and internal business analytics. Users report reduced manual workloads and faster credit decisions. Cornerstone Advisors identifies lending as the third-most common AI function among credit unions, placing them closer to fintech lenders than traditional banks in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Structural barriers to scaling AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite clear use cases, scaling AI in credit unions remains difficult. Data readiness is the most frequently cited constraint. Cornerstone Advisors reports that only 11% of credit unions rate their data strategy as very effective (nearly a quarter consider it ineffective). Without accessible, well-governed data, AI systems cannot deliver reliable outcomes, regardless of the underlying sophistication of the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust and explainability also limit the technology’s expansion. In regulated financial environments, opaque “black box” models create risk for institutions that as a matter of course have to justify their decisions to members. PYMNTS Intelligence highlights the importance of breaking down data silos and using shared intelligence models to improve transparency and auditability. Consortium-based approaches, like those used by Velera in thousands of credit unions, reflect a trend in the financial sector towards pooled data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Integration presents a further challenge. CULytics finds that 83% of credit unions cite integration with legacy systems as an obstacle to AI, a familiar issue to many financial institutions. Limited in-house expertise in AI compounds this, again suggesting fintech partnerships, credit union service organisations (CUSOs), or externally-managed platforms as ways to accelerate deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From experimentation to embedded practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; As AI becomes embedded in financial services, credit unions face a choice similar to that which has been confronted by banks and the wider fintech sector: placing AI as a foundational ability. Evidence suggests progress depends on disciplined execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means prioritising high-trust, high-impact use cases, so institutions can deliver visible benefits and not undermine members’ confidence in their trusted institutions. Strengthening data governance and accountability ensures AI-assisted decisions remain explainable and defensible. Partner-led integration might reduce technical complexity, while education and transparency align AI adoption with the values that underpin the cooperative organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “Credit Union Building” by Dano is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become.&amp;nbsp;Read the full story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Eileen Guo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TR10: AI companions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a&amp;nbsp;study&amp;nbsp;from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations.

Addressing the gap between investment and operational return, IBM has introduced a new service model designed to help businesses assemble, rather than purely build, their internal AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adopting-asset-based-consulting"&gt;Adopting asset-based consulting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional consultancy models typically rely on human labour to solve integration problems, a process that is often slow and capital-intensive. IBM is among the companies aiming to alter this dynamic by offering an asset-based consulting service. This approach combines standard advisory expertise with a catalogue of pre-built software assets, aiming to help clients construct and govern their own AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of commissioning bespoke development for every workflow, organisations can leverage existing architectures to redesign processes and connect AI agents to legacy systems. This method helps companies to achieve value by scaling new agentic applications without necessitating alterations to their existing core infrastructure, AI models, or preferred cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-a-multi-cloud-environment"&gt;Managing a multi-cloud environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A frequent concern for enterprise leaders is vendor lock-in, particularly when adopting proprietary platforms. IBM’s strategy acknowledges the reality of the heterogeneous enterprise IT landscape. The service supports a multi-vendor foundation, compatible with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, alongside IBM watsonx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach extends to the models themselves, supporting both open- and closed-source variants. By allowing companies to build upon their current investments rather than demanding a replacement strategy, the service addresses a barrier to adoption: the fear of technical debt accumulation when switching ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical backbone of this offering is IBM Consulting Advantage, the company’s internal delivery platform. Having utilised this system to support over 150 client engagements, IBM reports that the platform has boosted its own consultants’ productivity by up to 50 percent. The premise is that if these tools can accelerate delivery for IBM’s own teams, they should offer similar velocity for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service provides access to a marketplace of industry-specific AI agents and applications. For business leaders, this suggests a “platform-first” focus, where attention turns from managing individual models to managing a cohesive ecosystem of digital and human workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-active-deployment-of-a-platform-centric-approach-to-scaling-ai-value"&gt;Active deployment of a platform-centric approach to scaling AI value&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of such a platform-centric approach is best viewed through active deployment. Pearson, the global learning company, is currently utilising this service to construct a custom platform. Their implementation combines human expertise with agentic assistants to manage everyday work and decision-making processes, illustrating how the technology functions in a live operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a manufacturing firm has employed IBM’s solution to formalise its generative AI strategy. For this client, the focus was on identifying high-value use cases, testing targeted prototypes, and aligning leaders around a scalable strategy. The result was the deployment of AI assistants using multiple technologies within a secured, governed environment, laying a foundation for wider expansion across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the attention surrounding generative AI, the realisation of balance-sheet impact is not guaranteed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many organisations are investing in AI, but achieving real value at scale remains a major challenge,” notes Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting. “We have solved many of these challenges inside IBM by using AI to transform our own operations and deliver measurable results, giving us a proven playbook to help clients succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation is gradually moving away from the capabilities of specific LLMs and towards the architecture required to run them safely. Success in scaling AI and achieving value will likely depend on an organisation’s ability to integrate these solutions without creating new silos. Leaders must ensure that as they adopt pre-built agentic workflows, they maintain rigorous data lineage and governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPMorgan Chase treats AI spending as core infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111551" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This approach combines standard advisory expertise with a catalogue of pre-built software assets, aiming to help clients construct and govern their own AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of commissioning bespoke development for every workflow, organisations can leverage existing architectures to redesign processes and connect AI agents to legacy systems. This method helps companies to achieve value by scaling new agentic applications without necessitating alterations to their existing core infrastructure, AI models, or preferred cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-a-multi-cloud-environment"&gt;Managing a multi-cloud environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A frequent concern for enterprise leaders is vendor lock-in, particularly when adopting proprietary platforms. IBM’s strategy acknowledges the reality of the heterogeneous enterprise IT landscape. The service supports a multi-vendor foundation, compatible with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, alongside IBM watsonx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach extends to the models themselves, supporting both open- and closed-source variants. By allowing companies to build upon their current investments rather than demanding a replacement strategy, the service addresses a barrier to adoption: the fear of technical debt accumulation when switching ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical backbone of this offering is IBM Consulting Advantage, the company’s internal delivery platform. Having utilised this system to support over 150 client engagements, IBM reports that the platform has boosted its own consultants’ productivity by up to 50 percent. The premise is that if these tools can accelerate delivery for IBM’s own teams, they should offer similar velocity for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service provides access to a marketplace of industry-specific AI agents and applications. For business leaders, this suggests a “platform-first” focus, where attention turns from managing individual models to managing a cohesive ecosystem of digital and human workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-active-deployment-of-a-platform-centric-approach-to-scaling-ai-value"&gt;Active deployment of a platform-centric approach to scaling AI value&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of such a platform-centric approach is best viewed through active deployment. Pearson, the global learning company, is currently utilising this service to construct a custom platform. Their implementation combines human expertise with agentic assistants to manage everyday work and decision-making processes, illustrating how the technology functions in a live operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a manufacturing firm has employed IBM’s solution to formalise its generative AI strategy. For this client, the focus was on identifying high-value use cases, testing targeted prototypes, and aligning leaders around a scalable strategy. The result was the deployment of AI assistants using multiple technologies within a secured, governed environment, laying a foundation for wider expansion across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the attention surrounding generative AI, the realisation of balance-sheet impact is not guaranteed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many organisations are investing in AI, but achieving real value at scale remains a major challenge,” notes Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting. “We have solved many of these challenges inside IBM by using AI to transform our own operations and deliver measurable results, giving us a proven playbook to help clients succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation is gradually moving away from the capabilities of specific LLMs and towards the architecture required to run them safely. Success in scaling AI and achieving value will likely depend on an organisation’s ability to integrate these solutions without creating new silos. Leaders must ensure that as they adopt pre-built agentic workflows, they maintain rigorous data lineage and governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPMorgan Chase treats AI spending as core infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111551" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-2.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

(AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Few are going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by&amp;nbsp;GeekWire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-in-the-open-fails"&gt;“Building in the open” fails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg avatar" class="wp-image-2379511" height="470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zuckerberg-selfie-horizon-vr.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="avatars with legs in Meta's Horizon Worlds" class="wp-image-2422825" height="446" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-11-at-2.03.44-PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3083255" height="349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-5.08.10-PM.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta quest app store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-2913176" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2173579037-e1731325835302.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2245737" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/265939079_209878897972555_2250477409823774887_n.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2283968" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular"&gt;AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Ray-Ban display" class="wp-image-3047721" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta Ray-Ban display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta / Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal.

A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-2913176" height="454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2173579037-e1731325835302.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;An attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2245737" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/265939079_209878897972555_2250477409823774887_n.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-2283968" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/meta-horizon-worlds-personal-boundary.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ar-mixed-reality-and-ai-proved-more-popular"&gt;AR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meta Ray-Ban display" class="wp-image-3047721" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta Ray-Ban display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta / Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Rogue agents and shadow AI: Why VCs are betting big on AI security (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/rogue-agents-and-shadow-ai-why-vcs-are-betting-big-on-ai-security/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rick-caccia-witnessai.jpg?w=860" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rick-caccia-witnessai.jpg?w=860" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
