&lt;p&gt;To discuss what this means for the next generation of AI development and deployment, the two companies’ CEOs, and the president of OpenAI, spoke this morning with CNBC’s Jon Fortt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the biggest AI infrastructure project in history,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in the interview. “This partnership is about building an AI infrastructure that enables AI to go from the labs into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the partnership, OpenAI will deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure, including the NVIDIA Vera Rubin platform. NVIDIA also intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no partner but NVIDIA that can do this at this kind of scale, at this kind of speed,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="alignright size-large wp-image-85178" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OAI_Altmanquote-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The million-GPU AI factories built through this agreement will help OpenAI meet the training and inference demands of its next frontier of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Building this infrastructure is critical to everything we want to do,” Altman said. “This is the fuel that we need to drive improvement, drive better models, drive revenue, drive everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building Million-GPU Infrastructure to Meet AI Demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT — which in 2022 became the fastest application in history to reach 100 million users — the company has grown its user base to more than 700 million weekly active users and delivered increasingly advanced capabilities, including support for agentic AI, AI reasoning, multimodal data and longer context windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support its next phase of growth, the company’s AI infrastructure must scale up to meet not only training but inference demands of the most advanced models for&amp;nbsp; agentic and reasoning AI users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cost per unit of intelligence will keep falling and falling and falling, and we think that’s great,” said Altman. “But on the other side, the frontier of AI, maximum intellectual capability, is going up and up. And that enables more and more use — and a lot of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85184" height="510" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SamAltman-Quote.png" width="1020" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without enough computational resources, Altman explained, people would have to choose between impactful use cases, for example either researching a cancer cure or offering free education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one wants to make that choice,” he said. “And so increasingly, as we see this, the answer is just much more capacity so that we can serve the massive need and opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_34361"&gt;&lt;img alt="NVIDIA CEO opens the GPU tray on DGX-1 presented to OpenAI in San Francisco." class="wp-image-34361" height="493" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/15OpenAI_inside_tray_cropped.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-34361"&gt;In 2016, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first NVIDIA DGX system to OpenAI’s headquarters in San Francisco.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems built with NVIDIA Vera Rubin GPUs will generate their first tokens in the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership expands on a long-standing collaboration between NVIDIA and OpenAI, which began with Huang hand-delivering the first NVIDIA DGX system to the company in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a billion times more computational power than that initial server,” said Greg Brockman, president of OpenAI. “We’re able to actually create new breakthroughs, new models…to empower every individual and business because we’ll be able to reach the next level of scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huang emphasized that though this is the start of a massive buildout of AI infrastructure around the world, it’s just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re literally going to connect intelligence to every application, to every use case, to every device — and we’re just at the beginning,” Huang said. “This is the first 10 gigawatts, I assure you of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;MIT Department of Mathematics researchers David Roe ’06 and Andrew Sutherland ’90, PhD ’07 are among the inaugural recipients of the Renaissance Philanthropy and XTX Markets’ AI for Math grants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four additional MIT alumni — Anshula Gandhi ’19, Viktor Kunčak SM ’01, PhD ’07; Gireeja Ranade ’07; and Damiano Testa PhD ’05 — were also honored for separate projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 29 winning projects will support mathematicians and researchers at universities and organizations working to develop artificial intelligence systems that help advance mathematical discovery and research across several key tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland, along with&amp;nbsp;Chris Birkbeck&amp;nbsp;of the University of East Anglia,&amp;nbsp;will use their grant&amp;nbsp;to boost automated theorem proving by building connections between the&amp;nbsp;L-Functions and Modular Forms Database&amp;nbsp;(LMFDB) and the&amp;nbsp;Lean4 mathematics library&amp;nbsp;(mathlib).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Automated theorem provers are quite technically involved, but their development is under-resourced,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. With AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), the barrier to entry for these formal tools is dropping rapidly, making formal verification frameworks accessible to working mathematicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathlib is a large, community-driven mathematical library for the&amp;nbsp;Lean&amp;nbsp;theorem prover, a formal system that verifies the correctness of every step in a proof.&amp;nbsp;Mathlib currently contains on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mathematical results (such as lemmas, propositions, and theorems). The LMFDB,&amp;nbsp;a massive, collaborative online resource that serves as a kind of “encyclopedia” of modern number theory,&amp;nbsp;contains more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concrete statements.&amp;nbsp;Sutherland&amp;nbsp;and Roe are managing editors of the LMFDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland’s grant will be used for a&amp;nbsp;project that aims to augment both systems, making the LMFDB’s results available within mathlib as assertions that have not yet been formally proved, and providing precise formal definitions of the numerical data stored within the LMFDB. This bridge will benefit both human mathematicians and AI agents, and provide a framework for connecting other mathematical databases to formal theorem-proving systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main obstacles to automating mathematical discovery and proof are the limited amount of formalized math knowledge, the high cost of formalizing complex results, and the gap between what is computationally accessible and what is feasible to formalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these obstacles, the researchers will use the funding to build tools for accessing the LMFDB from mathlib, making a large database of unformalized mathematical knowledge accessible to a formal proof system. This approach enables proof assistants to identify specific targets for formalization without the need to formalize the entire LMFDB corpus in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a large database of unformalized number-theoretic facts available within mathlib will provide a powerful technique for mathematical discovery, because the set of facts an agent might wish to consider while searching for a theorem or proof is exponentially larger than the set of facts that eventually need to be formalized in actually proving the theorem,” says Roe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that proving new theorems at the frontier of mathematical knowledge often&amp;nbsp;involves steps that rely on a nontrivial computation. For example, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem uses what is known as the “3-5 trick” at a crucial point in the proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trick depends on the fact that the modular curve X_0(15) has only finitely many rational points, and none of those rational points correspond to a semi-stable elliptic curve,” according to&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. “This fact was known well before Wiles’ work, and is easy to verify using computational tools available in modern computer algebra systems, but it is not something one can realistically prove using pencil and paper, nor is it necessarily easy to formalize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While formal theorem provers are being connected to computer algebra systems for more efficient verification, tapping into computational outputs in existing mathematical databases offers several other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stored results leverages the thousands of CPU-years of computation time already spent in creating the LMFDB, saving money that would be needed to redo these computations. Having precomputed information available also makes it feasible to search for examples or counterexamples without knowing ahead of time how broad the search can be. In addition, mathematical databases are curated repositories, not simply a random collection of facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that number theorists emphasized the role of the conductor in databases of elliptic curves has already proved to be crucial to one notable mathematical discovery made using machine learning tools:&amp;nbsp;murmurations,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to build a team, engage with both the LMFDB and mathlib communities, start to formalize the definitions that underpin the elliptic curve, number field, and modular form sections of the LMFDB, and make it possible to run LMFDB searches from within mathlib,” says Roe. “If you are an MIT student interested in getting involved, feel free to reach out!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The LMFDB,&amp;nbsp;a massive, collaborative online resource that serves as a kind of “encyclopedia” of modern number theory,&amp;nbsp;contains more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concrete statements.&amp;nbsp;Sutherland&amp;nbsp;and Roe are managing editors of the LMFDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland’s grant will be used for a&amp;nbsp;project that aims to augment both systems, making the LMFDB’s results available within mathlib as assertions that have not yet been formally proved, and providing precise formal definitions of the numerical data stored within the LMFDB. This bridge will benefit both human mathematicians and AI agents, and provide a framework for connecting other mathematical databases to formal theorem-proving systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main obstacles to automating mathematical discovery and proof are the limited amount of formalized math knowledge, the high cost of formalizing complex results, and the gap between what is computationally accessible and what is feasible to formalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these obstacles, the researchers will use the funding to build tools for accessing the LMFDB from mathlib, making a large database of unformalized mathematical knowledge accessible to a formal proof system. This approach enables proof assistants to identify specific targets for formalization without the need to formalize the entire LMFDB corpus in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a large database of unformalized number-theoretic facts available within mathlib will provide a powerful technique for mathematical discovery, because the set of facts an agent might wish to consider while searching for a theorem or proof is exponentially larger than the set of facts that eventually need to be formalized in actually proving the theorem,” says Roe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that proving new theorems at the frontier of mathematical knowledge often&amp;nbsp;involves steps that rely on a nontrivial computation. For example, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem uses what is known as the “3-5 trick” at a crucial point in the proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trick depends on the fact that the modular curve X_0(15) has only finitely many rational points, and none of those rational points correspond to a semi-stable elliptic curve,” according to&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. “This fact was known well before Wiles’ work, and is easy to verify using computational tools available in modern computer algebra systems, but it is not something one can realistically prove using pencil and paper, nor is it necessarily easy to formalize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While formal theorem provers are being connected to computer algebra systems for more efficient verification, tapping into computational outputs in existing mathematical databases offers several other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stored results leverages the thousands of CPU-years of computation time already spent in creating the LMFDB, saving money that would be needed to redo these computations. Having precomputed information available also makes it feasible to search for examples or counterexamples without knowing ahead of time how broad the search can be. In addition, mathematical databases are curated repositories, not simply a random collection of facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that number theorists emphasized the role of the conductor in databases of elliptic curves has already proved to be crucial to one notable mathematical discovery made using machine learning tools:&amp;nbsp;murmurations,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to build a team, engage with both the LMFDB and mathlib communities, start to formalize the definitions that underpin the elliptic curve, number field, and modular form sections of the LMFDB, and make it possible to run LMFDB searches from within mathlib,” says Roe. “If you are an MIT student interested in getting involved, feel free to reach out!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Monday, OpenAI and Nvidia jointly announced a letter of intent for a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI's AI infrastructure, with Nvidia planning to invest up to $100 billion as the systems roll out. The companies said the first gigawatt of Nvidia systems will come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything starts with compute," said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in the announcement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-gigawatt project represents an astoundingly ambitious and as-yet-unproven scale for AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company's total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year's volume. "This is a giant project," Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put that power demand in perspective, 10 gigawatts equals the output of roughly 10 nuclear reactors, which typically output about 1 gigawatt per facility. Current data center energy consumption ranges from 10 megawatts to 1 gigawatt, with most large facilities consuming between 50 and 100 megawatts. OpenAI's planned infrastructure would dwarf existing installations, requiring as much electricity as multiple major cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership follows OpenAI's rapid user growth to 700 million weekly active users. Nvidia's stock rose nearly 4 percent on Monday following the announcement, adding roughly $170 billion to its market capitalization. The partnership establishes Nvidia as OpenAI's preferred strategic compute and networking partner, alongside OpenAI's existing relationships with Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and the recently announced Stargate project partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership announcement comes a week after Nvidia disclosed a $5 billion investment in Intel, taking a 4 percent stake in its longtime competitor as the two companies plan to co-develop custom data center and PC products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of the investment structure to CNBC. "Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia," Talkington told CNBC. "I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Racing for nuclear power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an August earnings call, Huang told investors that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, with about $35 billion going toward Nvidia chips and systems. At that rate, the 10 gigawatt project could require total investment exceeding $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the companies did not specify power sources in their announcement, the massive energy requirements have driven other tech giants to nuclear partnerships for similar projects. In September 2024, Microsoft signed a 20-year agreement to restart a Three Mile Island reactor for 835 megawatts, while in May of this year, Amazon Web Services purchased a data center next to Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear plant with plans to use up to 960 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other massive AI infrastructure projects are emerging across the US. In July, officials in Cheyenne, Wyoming, announced plans for an AI data center that would eventually scale to 10 gigawatts—consuming more electricity than all homes in the state combined, even in its earliest 1.8 gigawatt phase. Whether it's connected to OpenAI's plans remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman's ambition for mega-sized datacenter deals now stretches back over a year. In September of last year, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez told Bloomberg he had heard Altman wanted five to seven data centers of 5 gigawatts each. Alex de Vries of Digiconomist told Fortune that seven 5-gigawatt units would have "twice the power consumption of New York State combined."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned infrastructure buildout would significantly increase global energy consumption, which also raises environmental concerns. The International Energy Agency estimates that global data centers already consumed roughly 1.5 percent of global electricity in 2024. OpenAI's project also faces practical constraints. Existing power grid connections represent bottlenecks in power-constrained markets, with utilities struggling to keep pace with rapid AI expansion that could push global data center electricity demand to 945 terawatt hours by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said they expect to finalize details in the coming weeks. Huang told CNBC the $100 billion investment comes on top of all Nvidia's existing commitments and was not included in the company's recent financial forecasts to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other massive AI infrastructure projects are emerging across the US. In July, officials in Cheyenne, Wyoming, announced plans for an AI data center that would eventually scale to 10 gigawatts—consuming more electricity than all homes in the state combined, even in its earliest 1.8 gigawatt phase. Whether it's connected to OpenAI's plans remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman's ambition for mega-sized datacenter deals now stretches back over a year. In September of last year, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez told Bloomberg he had heard Altman wanted five to seven data centers of 5 gigawatts each. Alex de Vries of Digiconomist told Fortune that seven 5-gigawatt units would have "twice the power consumption of New York State combined."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned infrastructure buildout would significantly increase global energy consumption, which also raises environmental concerns. The International Energy Agency estimates that global data centers already consumed roughly 1.5 percent of global electricity in 2024. OpenAI's project also faces practical constraints. Existing power grid connections represent bottlenecks in power-constrained markets, with utilities struggling to keep pace with rapid AI expansion that could push global data center electricity demand to 945 terawatt hours by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said they expect to finalize details in the coming weeks. Huang told CNBC the $100 billion investment comes on top of all Nvidia's existing commitments and was not included in the company's recent financial forecasts to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

What could go wrong? (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/the-oakland-ballers-let-an-ai-manage-the-team-what-could-go-wrong/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oakland-Ballers.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;There’s a classic Simpsons episode in which the sly businessman Mr. Burns recruits real Major League Baseball players to join his company softball team in order to win a bet. But when the championship is on the line, Mr. Burns pulls eight-time National League all-star Darryl Strawberry for a substitute, Homer Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’re a left-hander, and so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it’s called playing the percentages,” Mr. Burns says to Strawberry. “It’s what smart managers do to win ballgames.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;High-level baseball is very mathematically-driven, with teams hiring dozens of data engineers to study granular statistics that can inform managerial decisions. But like Mr. Burns in that Simpsons episode, it’s tempting to overanalyze baseball statistics to the point of absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Oakland Ballers, an independent Pioneer League baseball team, took that concept of “playing the percentages” to the next level: they let an AI manage the team for a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Ballers were founded by edtech entrepreneur Paul Freedman as a salve to the departure of the beloved Oakland A’s, the Major League baseball team that owner John Fisher ripped away from local fans in what’s regarded as one of the most insidious managerial moves in sports history. Though they’re not a Major League team, the Oakland Ballers – coyly, the Oakland B’s – established an unprecedented national community of fans who rallied around the team in protest of the A’s departure. After just two seasons, the Ballers just won Oakland’s first baseball title since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The Oakland Ballers uniquely have the experience of being like a major league team in a minor league market,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “We can have creative flexibility. We can play with things and experiment with things way before the MLB or NBA or any of those leagues could do something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Minor league baseball organizations are often called upon to test new technology before it gets implemented in the majors, like challenging calls with instant replay footage or the automated ball-strike system. The Ballers embraced this attitude, especially given Freedman’s own background in tech, but have added in a dash of whimsy, piloting things that would never actually debut in Major League Baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, this meant partnering with Fan Controlled Sports to let fans make managerial decisions during one late season game. The Ballers ended up losing that game, in part because fans advocated for the funniest possible managerial decisions, rather than the savviest – at one point, the fans called upon a pitcher to pinch hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This time around, once the team clinched their postseason berth, the Ballers partnered with the AI company Distillery to commission AI software that could manage a baseball game in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Baseball is the perfect place to do an initial experiment like this, because it is so data-driven, and decisions are made very analytically,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “You have the pace to be able to do something literally after every pitch.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Distillery trained OpenAI’s ChatGPT on over a century’s worth of baseball data and analytics, including Ballers games, to approximate what decisions Ballers manager Aaron Miles would make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What the AI did was figure out what our human coach would have done – the ingenuity on strategy and the concepts came from [Miles], and the ability to use the data and recognize patterns… is what the AI did throughout the course of the game,” Freedman said. “So I think the role of human ingenuity is safe for now, and AI is a tool to be deployed to optimize decisions, but not to make them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI-controlled game went smoothly – in fact, the AI made all of the same choices regarding pitching changes, lineup construction, and pinch hitters that Miles would have made. The only time that Miles had to override the AI was to replace the starting catcher with his backup, since he was sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Miles took his temporary replacement by AI in stride – perhaps because he knows that his job is not actually in jeopardy. In a video posted to the Ballers’ Instagram, Miles walks to home plate before the game to shake hands with the opposing team’s manager – only instead of offering his own hand, he extends the tablet running the AI out for a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the use of AI struck a nerve for Oakland fans, who see companies like OpenAI – which powered Distillery’s baseball AI – as enterprises that prioritize “winning” the AI race over shipping products that have been properly tested for safety. For many fans, the AI experiment felt like a betrayal, similar to the kind of corporate greed that pushed three professional sports franchises out of Oakland in five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There goes the Ballers trying to appeal to Bay Area techies instead of baseball fans,” one commenter wrote. “It’s so over for Oakland.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This backlash wasn’t what the Ballers expected, and Freedman does not intend to repeat this AI experiment. But the reaction of the fans models a larger cultural tension in baseball and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It never feels good to have your fans be like, ‘We hate this,’” Freedman said. “But it’s not a bad thing that there’s more of a conversation about the pluses and minuses of this new technology now, as opposed to like, a decade later when it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oakland-Ballers.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;There’s a classic Simpsons episode in which the sly businessman Mr. Burns recruits real Major League Baseball players to join his company softball team in order to win a bet.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year growth, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool to Tinder, which scans your cameral roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Accel and Together Fund joined Salesforce Ventures in the all-equity seed round, which comes only three months after Rocket.new launched its platform in beta in June.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its debut, the startup has crossed 400,000 users — including over 10,000 paid subscribers — in 180 countries and reached $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue. It is aiming to scale that to $20–$25 million by year’s end and $60–$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rocket.new" class="wp-image-3048681" height="1070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg" width="1910" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Rocket.new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5–6% have developed B2B tools, and 4–5% have launched mental health apps, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said. He added that many users build a website on Lovable or Replit, then turn to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The platform combines large language models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems, which are trained on proprietary datasets from DhiWise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our underlying architecture is completely different from what Lovable, Bolt, and everyone is doing,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generating the first application takes about 25 minutes — much slower than most vibe-coding tools, which usually produce results within three. But in our early testing, Rocket.new delivered a more comprehensive user experience, with all essential modules included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rocket.new offers a free trial capped at one million tokens. After that, users pay a monthly subscription starting at $25 for five million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This model effectively discourages hobbyists, while giving Rocket.new a healthy gross margin of 50–55% — a figure it aims to raise to 60–70% within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. is Rocket.new’s largest market, contributing 26% of revenue, followed by Europe at 15–20% and India at 10%. To better serve its American users, the startup is establishing a U.S. headquarters in Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Virani noted that Rocket.new’s early traction was organic, driven by word-of-mouth and viral social posts. With fresh seed funding, the startup is looking to sharpen its go-to-market playbook, deepen its presence in key markets, and accelerate work on proprietary models and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We saw a clear gap between the magic of AI code generation and the reality of making that code production-ready,” Kartik Gupta, Investor at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch over email. “Rocket.new is purpose-built to solve this problem of iteration, maintenance, and deployment at enterprise scale.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rocket.new currently has a 58-member team, primarily in Surat, and expects to double its engineering and product staff in India over the next 12 months to support growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Rocket.new, an Indian startup building an AI-powered app development platform, has raised $15 million in a seed round led by Salesforce Ventures to take on viral vibe-coding rivals like Lovable, Cursor, and Bolt by letting users build full, production-ready apps from natural-language prompts rather than just quick prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Accel and Together Fund joined Salesforce Ventures in the all-equity seed round, which comes only three months after Rocket.new launched its platform in beta in June.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its debut, the startup has crossed 400,000 users — including over 10,000 paid subscribers — in 180 countries and reached $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue. It is aiming to scale that to $20–$25 million by year’s end and $60–$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rocket.new" class="wp-image-3048681" height="1070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocket-new-platform-screenshot.jpg" width="1910" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Rocket.new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5–6% have developed B2B tools, and 4–5% have launched mental health apps, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said. He added that many users build a website on Lovable or Replit, then turn to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The platform combines large language models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems, which are trained on proprietary datasets from DhiWise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our underlying architecture is completely different from what Lovable, Bolt, and everyone is doing,” Virani told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Generating the first application takes about 25 minutes — much slower than most vibe-coding tools, which usually produce results within three.

The company launched its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go paid plan for the country’s users last month and now is rolling out the same plan in Indonesia for Rp75,000 ($4.50) per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. The plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said on X.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Turley said that since the company launched the ChatGPT Go plan in India, paid subscribers have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This move puts OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which launched its own similarly-priced AI Plus subscription plan in Indonesia earlier this month. Google’s AI Plus plan gives users access to its Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, along with creative tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. The plan also includes enhanced features for Google’s AI research assistant NotebookLM and integrates AI capabilities into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, along with 200GB of cloud storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2205105208.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its budget-friendly ChatGPT subscription plan beyond India.
