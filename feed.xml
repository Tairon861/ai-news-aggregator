          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Anthropic announced a new feature that expands its Artifacts document management system into the basis of a personal AI app gallery resembling something from the Flash game era of the early 2000s—though these apps run on modern web code rather than Adobe's defunct plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using plain English dialogue, users can build and share interactive applications directly within Claude's chatbot interface using a new API capability that lets artifacts interact with Claude itself. Claude is an AI assistant similar to ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude has been capable of building web apps for some time, but Anthropic has put renewed focus on the feature that many have overlooked. "I'm amused that Anthropic turned 'we added a window.claude.complete() function to Artifacts' into what looks like a major new product launch," wrote independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post, "but I can't say it's bad marketing for them to do that!"&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Anthropic gallery site, example artifact apps come organized into categories like "Learn something," "Life hacks," and "Be creative." Featured artifacts at launch include an interactive writing editor, a bedtime story generator, a molecule visualizer, and a 3D first-person "Anthropic office simulator" where you can walk around and interact with simple representations of real Anthropic employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can examine the prompts and the chats that made those examples possible and even modify them for their own purposes. The beta Artifacts gallery feature is currently available to users on Claude's Free, Pro, and Max plans, and it's accessible through the Claude app's sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;How it works: AI as the coder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users ask Claude to create an artifact, the AI model writes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codef, typically using React (a JavaScript library for web interfaces) for interactive components. Anthropic provided a demo video that showcases the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Anthropic's "Build a Claude-powered app" video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key addition in the latest update is a "window.claude.complete()" function that AI-generated apps can use to make their own requests back to Claude, enabling in-app conversational chatbot features like dynamic NPCs or tutors that users can talk to. Inspired by a demo created by Anthropic, we created a simple 2D simulation where the users move around an office and chat with some members of Ars Technica staff as if they were chatbot characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the experience is entirely sandboxed for now. Unlike traditional web development, where developers manually integrate APIs and services, Claude creates self-contained applications that can only communicate with Claude itself—no external API calls ("yet," as Anthropic notes), no database connections, and no local browser storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2103208 align-center"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the interface for building apps within Claude.

                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All state management happens in-memory through React components or JavaScript variables that Claude implements, creating a simplified environment where users describe their ideas and Claude handles both the interface code and the AI logic. In a way, it's a form of vibe coding&amp;nbsp;but self-contained entirely within its own web environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web portal throwback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unintentionally, Anthropic's artifact gallery interface reminds us of classic Flash gaming portals, with each tile in the gallery showing a snapshot of the interactive experience waiting inside—similar to how Flash portals teased players with game screenshots back in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For those who missed the Flash era, these in-browser apps feel somewhat like the vintage apps that defined a generation of Internet culture from the late 1990s through the 2000s when it first became possible to create complex in-browser experiences. Adobe Flash (originally Macromedia Flash) began as animation software for designers but quickly became the backbone of interactive web content when it gained its own programming language, ActionScript, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike Flash games, where hosting costs fell on portal operators, Anthropic has crafted a system where users pay for their own fun through their existing Claude subscriptions. "When someone uses your Claude-powered app, they authenticate with their existing Claude account," Anthropic explained in its announcement. "Their API usage counts against their subscription, not yours. You pay nothing for their usage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Flash games of yesteryear, any Claude-powered apps you build run in the browser and can be shared with anyone who has a Claude account. They're interactive experiences shared with a simple link, no installation required, created by other people for the sake of creating, except now they're powered by JavaScript instead of ActionScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can share these apps with others individually, right now Anthropic's Artifact gallery only shows examples made by Anthropic and your own personal Artifacts. (If Anthropic expanded it into the future, it might end up feeling a bit like Scratch meets Newgrounds, but with AI doing the coding.) Ultimately, humans are still behind the wheel, describing what kinds of apps they want the AI model to build and guiding the process when it inevitably makes mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mistakes, don't expect perfect results at first. Usually, building an app with Claude is an interactive experience that requires some guidance to achieve your desired results. But with a little patience and a lot of tokens, you'll be vibe coding in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Anthropic announced a new feature that expands its Artifacts document management system into the basis of a personal AI app gallery resembling something from the Flash game era of the early 2000s—though these apps run on modern web code rather than Adobe's defunct plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using plain English dialogue, users can build and share interactive applications directly within Claude's chatbot interface using a new API capability that lets artifacts interact with Claude itself. Claude is an AI assistant similar to ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude has been capable of building web apps for some time, but Anthropic has put renewed focus on the feature that many have overlooked. "I'm amused that Anthropic turned 'we added a window.claude.complete() function to Artifacts' into what looks like a major new product launch," wrote independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post, "but I can't say it's bad marketing for them to do that!"&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Anthropic gallery site, example artifact apps come organized into categories like "Learn something," "Life hacks," and "Be creative." Featured artifacts at launch include an interactive writing editor, a bedtime story generator, a molecule visualizer, and a 3D first-person "Anthropic office simulator" where you can walk around and interact with simple representations of real Anthropic employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can examine the prompts and the chats that made those examples possible and even modify them for their own purposes. The beta Artifacts gallery feature is currently available to users on Claude's Free, Pro, and Max plans, and it's accessible through the Claude app's sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;How it works: AI as the coder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users ask Claude to create an artifact, the AI model writes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codef, typically using React (a JavaScript library for web interfaces) for interactive components. Anthropic provided a demo video that showcases the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      Anthropic's "Build a Claude-powered app" video.

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key addition in the latest update is a "window.claude.complete()" function that AI-generated apps can use to make their own requests back to Claude, enabling in-app conversational chatbot features like dynamic NPCs or tutors that users can talk to. Inspired by a demo created by Anthropic, we created a simple 2D simulation where the users move around an office and chat with some members of Ars Technica staff as if they were chatbot characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the experience is entirely sandboxed for now. Unlike traditional web development, where developers manually integrate APIs and services, Claude creates self-contained applications that can only communicate with Claude itself—no external API calls ("yet," as Anthropic notes), no database connections, and no local browser storage.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All state management happens in-memory through React components or JavaScript variables that Claude implements, creating a simplified environment where users describe their ideas and Claude handles both the interface code and the AI logic. In a way, it's a form of vibe coding&amp;nbsp;but self-contained entirely within its own web environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web portal throwback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unintentionally, Anthropic's artifact gallery interface reminds us of classic Flash gaming portals, with each tile in the gallery showing a snapshot of the interactive experience waiting inside—similar to how Flash portals teased players with game screenshots back in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who missed the Flash era, these in-browser apps feel somewhat like the vintage apps that defined a generation of Internet culture from the late 1990s through the 2000s when it first became possible to create complex in-browser experiences. Adobe Flash (originally Macromedia Flash) began as animation software for designers but quickly became the backbone of interactive web content when it gained its own programming language, ActionScript, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike Flash games, where hosting costs fell on portal operators, Anthropic has crafted a system where users pay for their own fun through their existing Claude subscriptions. "When someone uses your Claude-powered app, they authenticate with their existing Claude account," Anthropic explained in its announcement. "Their API usage counts against their subscription, not yours. You pay nothing for their usage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Flash games of yesteryear, any Claude-powered apps you build run in the browser and can be shared with anyone who has a Claude account. They're interactive experiences shared with a simple link, no installation required, created by other people for the sake of creating, except now they're powered by JavaScript instead of ActionScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can share these apps with others individually, right now Anthropic's Artifact gallery only shows examples made by Anthropic and your own personal Artifacts. (If Anthropic expanded it into the future, it might end up feeling a bit like Scratch meets Newgrounds, but with AI doing the coding.) Ultimately, humans are still behind the wheel, describing what kinds of apps they want the AI model to build and guiding the process when it inevitably makes mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mistakes, don't expect perfect results at first. Usually, building an app with Claude is an interactive experience that requires some guidance to achieve your desired results. But with a little patience and a lot of tokens, you'll be vibe coding in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Meta has largely beaten an AI training copyright lawsuit raised by 13 book authors—including comedian Sarah Silverman and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz—the only matter left to settle in that case is whether Meta violated copyright laws by torrenting books used to train Llama models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order that partly grants Meta's motion for summary judgment, judge Vince Chhabria confirmed that Meta and the authors would meet on July 11 to "discuss how to proceed on the plaintiffs’ separate claim that Meta unlawfully distributed their protected works during the torrenting process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chhabria's order suggested that authors may struggle to win this part of the fight, too, due to a lack of evidence, as there has not yet been much discovery on this issue that was raised so late in the case. But he also warned that Meta was wrong to argue its torrenting was completely "irrelevant" to whether its copying of books was fair use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chhabria suggested the torrenting—which may have comprised more than 80.6 terabytes of data from one shadow library, LibGen—is "at least potentially relevant" in "a few different ways."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Chhabria noted that Meta deciding to pirate books from shadow libraries was "relevant to the issue of bad faith." That’s connected to the first factor of a fair use analysis, which weighs the character of the use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors had argued that Meta had sparked conversations with some publishers about licensing authors' works, but "after failing to acquire licenses," CEO Mark Zuckerberg "escalated" the issue, Chhabria explained. That prompted a decision to acquire books from pirate libraries instead, Chhabria wrote, with Meta admittedly using BitTorrent to seize data after abandoning its pursuit of licensing deals for the same books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that aspect of the trial may not matter much, since Chhabria noted that "the law is in flux about whether bad faith is relevant to fair use."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;It could certainly look worse for Meta if authors manage to present evidence supporting the second way that torrenting could be relevant to the case, Chhabaria suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta downloading copyrighted material from shadow libraries" would also be relevant to the character of the use, "if it benefitted those who created the libraries and thus supported and perpetuated their unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted works," Chhabria wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting potential strikes against Meta, Chhabria pointed out that the "vast majority of cases" involving "this sort of peer-to-peer file-sharing" are found to "constitute copyright infringement." And it likely doesn't help Meta's case that "some of the libraries Meta used have themselves been found liable for infringement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Meta may overcome this argument, too, since book authors "have not submitted any evidence" that potentially shows how Meta's downloading may perhaps be "propping up" or financially benefiting pirate libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chhabria noted that the "last issue relating to the character of Meta’s use" of books in regards to its torrenting is "the relationship between Meta’s downloading of the plaintiffs’ books and Meta’s use of the books to train Llama."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors had tried to argue that these elements were distinct. But Chhabria said there's no separating the fact that Meta downloaded the books to serve the "highly transformative" purpose of training Llama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because Meta’s ultimate use of the plaintiffs’ books was transformative, so too was Meta’s downloading of those books," Chhabria wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI training rulings may get more authors paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors only learned of Meta's torrenting through discovery in the lawsuit, and because of that, Chhabria noted that "the record on Meta’s alleged distribution is incomplete."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that authors may be able to show evidence that Meta "contributed to the BitTorrent network" by providing significant computing power that could've meaningfully assisted shadow libraries, Chhabria said in a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Chhabria dinged authors for citing only an outdated Ars Technica article from 2010 that suggested that people only rarely used torrents to pirate books. (E-book piracy has significantly spiked since then, as TorrentFreak has documented in more recent reports that also note research showing that taking pirated books offline can benefit book sales.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More will be revealed as the Meta case advances next month, but Chhabria noted that one potential outcome, win or lose for authors, could be that publishers become incentivized to make it easier to license authors' works for AI training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Publishers may not currently hold the subsidiary rights necessary to make group licensing possible," Chhabria wrote. "But it’s hard to believe that they won’t soon start negotiating those rights with their authors so that they can engage in large-scale negotiation and licensing" with large language model (LLM) developers—"assuming they haven’t already started to do so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It seems especially likely that these licensing markets will arise if LLM developers’ only choices are to get licenses or forgo the use of copyrighted books as training data," Chhabria noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be the outcome if other authors suing AI companies secure victories that Chhabria views as inevitable. They would need to show evidence that AI products dilute markets for their works, which the authors suing Meta failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his ruling granting Meta the win against authors' copyright infringement claims, Chhabria suggested that Meta won only because authors raised the "wrong arguments," suggesting Meta may be more inclined to renew licensing talks in the future if a stronger copyright fight is raised, despite winning this landmark copyright battle against a handful of authors this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if AI companies facing that potential reality "instead choose to use only public domain works as training data (instead of licensing copyrighted works), that would indicate that they don’t actually need the copyrighted works as badly as they say they do," Chhabria wrote. And if that's true, there's likely little excuse for torrenting of pirated books that authors otherwise had long considered an obvious example of copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Meta has largely beaten an AI training copyright lawsuit raised by 13 book authors—including comedian Sarah Silverman and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz—the only matter left to settle in that case is whether Meta violated copyright laws by torrenting books used to train Llama models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order that partly grants Meta's motion for summary judgment, judge Vince Chhabria confirmed that Meta and the authors would meet on July 11 to "discuss how to proceed on the plaintiffs’ separate claim that Meta unlawfully distributed their protected works during the torrenting process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chhabria's order suggested that authors may struggle to win this part of the fight, too, due to a lack of evidence, as there has not yet been much discovery on this issue that was raised so late in the case. But he also warned that Meta was wrong to argue its torrenting was completely "irrelevant" to whether its copying of books was fair use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chhabria suggested the torrenting—which may have comprised more than 80.6 terabytes of data from one shadow library, LibGen—is "at least potentially relevant" in "a few different ways."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Chhabria noted that Meta deciding to pirate books from shadow libraries was "relevant to the issue of bad faith." That’s connected to the first factor of a fair use analysis, which weighs the character of the use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors had argued that Meta had sparked conversations with some publishers about licensing authors' works, but "after failing to acquire licenses," CEO Mark Zuckerberg "escalated" the issue, Chhabria explained. That prompted a decision to acquire books from pirate libraries instead, Chhabria wrote, with Meta admittedly using BitTorrent to seize data after abandoning its pursuit of licensing deals for the same books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that aspect of the trial may not matter much, since Chhabria noted that "the law is in flux about whether bad faith is relevant to fair use."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;It could certainly look worse for Meta if authors manage to present evidence supporting the second way that torrenting could be relevant to the case, Chhabaria suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta downloading copyrighted material from shadow libraries" would also be relevant to the character of the use, "if it benefitted those who created the libraries and thus supported and perpetuated their unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted works," Chhabria wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting potential strikes against Meta, Chhabria pointed out that the "vast majority of cases" involving "this sort of peer-to-peer file-sharing" are found to "constitute copyright infringement." And it likely doesn't help Meta's case that "some of the libraries Meta used have themselves been found liable for infringement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Meta may overcome this argument, too, since book authors "have not submitted any evidence" that potentially shows how Meta's downloading may perhaps be "propping up" or financially benefiting pirate libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chhabria noted that the "last issue relating to the character of Meta’s use" of books in regards to its torrenting is "the relationship between Meta’s downloading of the plaintiffs’ books and Meta’s use of the books to train Llama."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors had tried to argue that these elements were distinct. But Chhabria said there's no separating the fact that Meta downloaded the books to serve the "highly transformative" purpose of training Llama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because Meta’s ultimate use of the plaintiffs’ books was transformative, so too was Meta’s downloading of those books," Chhabria wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI training rulings may get more authors paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors only learned of Meta's torrenting through discovery in the lawsuit, and because of that, Chhabria noted that "the record on Meta’s alleged distribution is incomplete."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that authors may be able to show evidence that Meta "contributed to the BitTorrent network" by providing significant computing power that could've meaningfully assisted shadow libraries, Chhabria said in a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After all, Cluely isn’t just offering a product that may have questionable uses; the startup has also become famous for using what many people call rage-bait marketing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Cluely’s ability to grab attention is precisely what attracted a16z to the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even before meeting Cluely’s founder Roy Lee, Andreessen Horowitz’s partner Bryan Kim thought that startups need new marketing tactics in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kim, like many investors, previously thought that building a superb “artisan” product with highly desired features was the key to a startup’s lasting success, he explained on the latest a16z podcast episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But shortly after the emergence of generative AI, he noticed that offering an exceptional product might not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you craft this thing and OpenAI or someone builds a new model to include that part in their product, you’re done,” Kim said. “So, it couldn’t become this highly thoughtful, slow-build product. It needed to be something where founders moved extremely quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That realization has led Kim to believe that speed, whether in marketing or product building, is paramount to creating a successful startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this month, Kim published a post explaining his theory of why, for consumer-facing AI startups, “momentum is the moat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When Kim met Lee and saw that Cluely had been able to convert awareness into paying customers, he instantly knew that he had discovered a founder he had theorized about.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s been so hard to pierce through the noise of everything AI, especially in consumer, and to do that consistently is actually near impossible,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How does Lee explain why his polarizing marketing approach has generated so much buzz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Most people don’t know how to make viral content,” Lee said on the podcast. “Everyone on X is trying to [sound] like the most intellectual, thoughtful person. But this just lacks viral sense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee, instead, had studied why some posts on TikTok and Instagram blow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Algorithms promote the most controversial things,” he said. “I’m just literally applying the same principles of controversy on X and LinkedIn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What many people don’t know, Lee said, is that Cluely barely had a functioning product when the startup launched in April with its slickly produced video of Lee using its hidden AI to lie to a woman about his age and knowledge of art while on a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite having some semblance of a product, the startup has yet to unveil the solution it has been hyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The internet is up in storm saying, ‘Where’s the product?’” Lee said. “We’re earlier than the latest YC batch of companies. Yet, we’re generating more views than every single one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee is convinced that once the product launches, it will generate even more excitement than if Cluely introduced it without “marketing” the company for the last two months. (The official launch is set for Friday, June 27, he posted on X.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kim sees Cluely’s approach as a perfect embodiment of his “momentum as a moat” theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since time is of the essence in AI, the a16z partner is certain that Cluely can figure out its product on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s important is to try to build a plane as it’s falling down the cliff,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’ll all see soon if that plane soars or crashes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG-0036-from-100CANON.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;When Cluely, a startup claiming to be building a product that helps people “cheat” on everything, announced that it raised a $15 million Series A financing round from Andreessen Horowitz, some people on X criticized the VC firm for backing the controversial company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The internet is up in storm saying, ‘Where’s the product?’” Lee said. “We’re earlier than the latest YC batch of companies. Yet, we’re generating more views than every single one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lee is convinced that once the product launches, it will generate even more excitement than if Cluely introduced it without “marketing” the company for the last two months. (The official launch is set for Friday, June 27, he posted on X.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kim sees Cluely’s approach as a perfect embodiment of his “momentum as a moat” theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since time is of the essence in AI, the a16z partner is certain that Cluely can figure out its product on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s important is to try to build a plane as it’s falling down the cliff,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We’ll all see soon if that plane soars or crashes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/why-a16z-vc-believes-that-cluely-the-cheat-on-everything-startup-is-the-new-blueprint-for-ai-startups/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 21:06:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Google launches Doppl, a new app that lets you visualize how an outfit might look on you (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/google-launches-doppl-a-new-app-that-lets-you-visualize-how-an-outfit-might-look-on-you/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google is launching a new experimental app called Doppl that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you, the company announced on Thursday. The app is available on iOS and Android in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Doppl is designed to let you virtually try on outfits on a digital version of yourself. The app works by first getting you to upload a full-body photo of yourself. From there, you can use photos or screenshots of different outfits to virtually try them on. These images could be a photo of an outfit you see at a thrift store or on a friend, or even a screenshot of an outfit you see while scrolling through social media. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once you select an outfit that you want to visualize, Doppl will create an image of a virtual version of yourself wearing the outfit. Doppl can also take these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos so you can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can save your favorite looks and browse through all of your other virtual try-ons. Plus, you can also share your look with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3022615" height="364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/doppl-google.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant says the new app builds on Google Shopping’s recently launched capabilities that allow you to try on clothes virtually. By launching the functionality in a stand-alone app, Google is making the feature easier to access while allowing people to explore their style in a fun and interactive way, the company believes. It may also help Google collect more data on how apps like this could work, to aid its future efforts in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Google has offered virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. With Doppl, the company is letting you try clothes on an animated version of your own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We hope Doppl helps you explore your style in new and exciting ways,” Google said in a blog post. “As a Google Labs experiment, Doppl is in its early days and it might not always get things right. Fit, appearance and clothing details may not always be accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Given that the Doppl is an experimental launch, it’s unknown when or if Google plans to bring the app to additional regions. &lt;/p&gt;

Now, with his new, New York-based venture Audos, he’s betting that AI can help him scale that process from “tens” of startups a year to “hundreds of thousands” of aspiring business owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The timing certainly feels right. Mass layoffs across a variety of industries have left many workers reconsidering their career paths, while AI tools have markedly lowered the barrier to building digital products and services. At the center of that Venn diagram is Werdelin’s latest venture, with its promise to help “everyday entrepreneurs create million dollar AI companies” without requiring technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Werdelin’s journey from Prehype to Audos reflects the broader transformation happening in entrepreneurship right now. At Prehype, the focus was on working with tech founders to build traditional startups, the kind that might raise millions and aim for billion-dollar exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, he tells TechCrunch, “What we’re trying to do is take all that knowledge, all the methodology that we’ve created over the years of building all these big companies, and really trying to democratize it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea is that “everyday entrepreneurs” may sense a shift is afoot but may not be keen to experiment with so-called AI agents or know how to reach customers. Audos is more than happy to help them, supplying these individuals with AI tools to build sophisticated products using natural language, and taking advantage of social media algorithms to find them their niche customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Facebook and a lot of these platforms, they are just incredible algorithms, and they’re incredible at figuring out [how to reach your customer] if you define a customer group,” says Werdelin, who co-founded Audos with his Prehype partner Nicholas Thorne. In fact, Audos uses this system to quickly test whether a founder’s business idea has sustainable customer acquisition costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approach seems to be working. Audos has helped launch “low hundreds” of businesses since its beta launch, with its own customers discovering the platform through Instagram ads asking “Have you ever thought about starting something, but don’t know where to go?” Among them, Werdelin says, are a car mechanic who wants to help people evaluate repair quotes, an individual who is selling “after death logistics” services, virtual golf swing coaches, and AI nutritionists.&amp;nbsp;In a winking reference to billion-dollar businesses, or so-called unicorns, he calls these one- and two-person teams “donkeycorns.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3022679" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-6.47.58PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All went through the same process: they clicked on Audos’s ad, its AI agent launched a conversation to figure out the problems these individuals want to tackle and who they want to serve, and, when it was satisfied with the answers, Audos got them in front of potential customers as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for returns, Audos operates on a fundamentally different model than traditional accelerators or venture capital. Instead of taking equity, the company takes a 15% revenue share from the businesses it helps launch. In return, founders get up to $25,000 in funding, access to those AI-powered business development tools, and help with distribution (again, primarily through paid social media advertising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not taking any equity in their business,” Werdelin says. There isn’t much point. “We don’t think these companies might ever get sold,” he says. “What we’re really inspired by are the mom-and-pop shops that are the backbone of our society.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The revenue share continues indefinitely, similar to platform fees charged by Apple’s App Store. For founders, that means giving up a significant portion of their revenue in perpetuity — a 15% cut that could cost entrepreneurs hundreds of thousands of dollars over time. Some will undoubtedly see that trade-off as worthwhile; others might question whether the long-term costs justify the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s value proposition raises other questions, too, given how quickly the landscape is changing. While Werdelin emphasizes helping founders build relationships with customers, it’s unclear how much of that work the AI agents can actually handle. There’s also the matter of differentiation. As Werdelin readily acknowledges, “the world is full of these tools” and they’re getting better rapidly. What happens when entrepreneurs can access similar AI capabilities without paying a permanent revenue tax?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s VCs don’t sound worried about those scenarios. True Ventures led Audos’s $11.5 million seed round, with partner Tony Conrad explaining the appeal in a Zoom call this week. In addition to having confidence in Werdelin and Thorne, says Conrad, “I think there are just lots and lots of people” who might eagerly embrace the opportunity to work with a platform like Audos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Conrad draws parallels to Instagram’s $1 billion exit with just 13 employees, suggesting that AI could enable even more leverage, even if Audos — which itself employs just five people altogether currently —&amp;nbsp; isn’t chasing unicorns. As Werdelin explains it, “What we’re after here is the millions of people who can create million-dollar businesses or half-million dollar businesses that are real and life changing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adds Werdelin separately of why he spun up Audos, “What we’re trying to do is to figure out how you make a million companies that do a million dollars [in annual revenue]. That’s a trillion dollar turnover business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Midway through 2025, it doesn’t sound crazy. Extending the benefits of entrepreneurship to people who traditionally haven’t had access to startup capital or technical skills is an increasingly compelling proposition as traditional employment begins to feel less and less stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We believe that there should be somebody who goes out and really helps these smaller entrepreneurs that are building something that is not venture backable,” says Werdelin. “We believe that the world is better with more entrepreneurship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Audos’s other investors include Offline Venture and Bungalow Capital, along with numerous high-profile angel investors – Niklas Zennstrom and Mario Schlosser among them.&lt;/p&gt;

Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood’s founder and chief executive, said at the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This first microgrid, housed at the company’s facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation’s largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(That’s tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn’t be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Redwood's batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A close up of grid of battery packs from Redwood Materials." class="wp-image-1119406" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250626_batterypacks_embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY REDWOOD MATERIALS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redwood Energy’s microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; recently reported.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it "would be logical targets" for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia and the Midwest as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"We're talking to a broad cross section of those companies," he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Redwood's microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe’s local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood's new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they’ll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company’s recycling process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour’s worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company’s new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials, one of the US’s largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The event marked the launch of the company's new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood’s founder and chief executive, said at the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This first microgrid, housed at the company’s facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation’s largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(That’s tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Redwood’s project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn’t be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Redwood's batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A close up of grid of battery packs from Redwood Materials." class="wp-image-1119406" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250626_batterypacks_embed.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY REDWOOD MATERIALS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redwood Energy’s microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; recently reported.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it "would be logical targets" for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia and the Midwest as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"We're talking to a broad cross section of those companies," he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.&lt;/p&gt;
