You can read more from the series here&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In mid-October, a mysterious object cracked the windshield of a packed Boeing 737 cruising at 36,000 feet above Utah, forcing the pilots into an emergency landing. The internet was suddenly buzzing with the prospect that the plane had been hit by a piece of space debris. We still don’t know exactly what hit the plane—likely a remnant of a weather balloon—but it turns out the speculation online wasn’t that far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because while the risk of flights being hit by space junk is still small, it is, in fact, growing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About three pieces of old space equipment—used rockets and defunct satellites—fall into Earth’s atmosphere every day, according to estimates by the European Space Agency. By the mid-2030s, there may be dozens. The increase is linked to the growth in the number of satellites in orbit. Currently, around 12,900 active satellites circle the planet. In a decade, there may be 100,000 of them, according to analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To minimize the risk of orbital collisions, operators guide old satellites to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. But the physics of that reentry process are not well understood, and we don’t know how much material burns up and how much reaches the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The number of such landfall events is increasing,” says Richard Ocaya, a professor of physics at the University of Free State in South Africa and a coauthor of a recent paper on space debris risk. “We expect it may be increasing exponentially in the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So far, space debris hasn’t injured anybody—in the air or on the ground. But multiple close calls have been reported in recent years. In March last year, an 0.7-kilogram chunk of metal pierced the roof of a house in Florida. The object was later confirmed to be a remnant of a battery pallet tossed out from the International Space Station. When the strike occurred, the homeowner’s 19-year-old son was resting in a next-door room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in February this year, a 1.5-meter-long fragment of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket crashed down near a warehouse outside Poland’s fifth-largest city, Poznan. Another piece was found in a nearby forest. A month later, a 2.5-kilogram piece of a Starlink satellite dropped on a farm in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Other incidents have been reported in Australia and Africa. And many more may be going completely unnoticed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you were to find a bunch of burnt electronics in a forest somewhere, your first thought is not that it came from a spaceship,” says James Beck, the director of the UK-based space engineering research firm Belstead Research. He warns that we don’t fully understand the risk of space debris strikes and that it might be much higher than satellite operators want us to believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, SpaceX, the owner of the currently largest mega-constellation, Starlink, claims that its satellites are “designed for demise” and completely burn up when they spiral from orbit and fall through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Beck, who has performed multiple wind tunnel tests using satellite mock-ups to mimic atmospheric forces, says the results of such experiments raise doubts. Some satellite components are made of durable materials such as titanium and special alloy composites that don’t melt even at the extremely high temperatures that arise during a hypersonic atmospheric descent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have done some work for some small-satellite manufacturers and basically, their major problem is that the tanks get down,” Beck says. “For larger satellites, around 800 kilos, we would expect maybe two or three objects to land.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to quantify how much of a danger space debris poses. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that “the rapid growth in satellite deployments presents a novel challenge” for aviation safety, one that “cannot be quantified with the same precision as more established hazards.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the Federal Aviation Administration has calculated some preliminary numbers on the risk to flights: In a 2023 analysis, the agency estimated that by 2035, the risk that one plane per year will experience a disastrous space debris strike will be around 7 in 10,000. Such a collision would either destroy the aircraft immediately or lead to a rapid loss of air pressure, threatening the lives of all on board.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The casualty risk to humans on the ground will be much higher. Aaron Boley, an associate professor in astronomy and a space debris researcher at the University of British Columbia, Canada, says that if megaconstellation satellites “don’t demise entirely,” the risk of a single human death or injury caused by a space debris strike on the ground could reach around 10% per year by 2035. That would mean a better than even chance that someone on Earth would be hit by space junk about every decade. In its report, the FAA put the chances even higher with similar assumptions, estimating that “one person on the planet would be expected to be injured or killed every two years.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts are starting to think about how they might incorporate space debris into their air safety processes. The German space situational awareness company Okapi Orbits, for example, in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), is exploring ways to adapt air traffic control systems so that pilots and air traffic controllers can receive timely and accurate alerts about space debris threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But predicting the path of space debris is challenging too. In recent years, advances in AI have helped improve predictions of space objects’ trajectories in the vacuum of space, potentially reducing the risk of orbital collisions. But so far, these algorithms can’t properly account for the effects of the gradually thickening atmosphere that space junk encounters during reentry. Radar and telescope observations can help, but the exact location of the impact becomes clear with only very short notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even with high-fidelity models, there’s so many variables at play that having a very accurate reentry location is difficult,” says Njord Eggen, a data analyst at Okapi Orbits. Space debris goes around the planet every hour and a half when in low Earth orbit, he notes, “so even if you have uncertainties on the order of 10 minutes, that’s going to have drastic consequences when it comes to the location where it could impact.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For aviation companies, the problem is not just a potential strike, as catastrophic as that would be. To avoid accidents, authorities are likely to temporarily close the airspace in at-risk regions, which creates delays and costs money. Boley and his colleagues published a paper earlier this year estimating that busy aerospace regions such as northern Europe or the northeastern United States already have about a 26% yearly chance of experiencing at least one disruption due to the reentry of a major space debris item. By the time all planned constellations are fully deployed, aerospace closures due to space debris hazards may become nearly as common as those due to bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because current reentry predictions are unreliable, many of these closures may end up being unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, when a 21-metric-ton Chinese Long March mega-rocket was falling to Earth in 2022, predictions suggested its debris could scatter across Spain and parts of France. In the end, the rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean. But the 30-minute closure of south European airspace delayed and diverted hundreds of flights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, international regulators are urging satellite operators and launch providers to deorbit large satellites and rocket bodies in a controlled way, when possible, by carefully guiding them into remote parts of the ocean using residual fuel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The European Space Agency estimates that only about half the rocket bodies reentering the atmosphere do so in a controlled way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, around 2,300 old and no-longer-controllable rocket bodies still linger in orbit, slowly spiraling toward Earth with no mechanisms for operators to safely guide them into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s enough material up there that even if we change our practices, we will still have all those rocket bodies eventually reenter,” Boley says. “Although the probability of space debris hitting an aircraft is small, the probability that the debris will spread and fall over busy airspace is not small. That’s actually quite likely.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/plane-debris.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel (IQT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&amp;amp;D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships and M&amp;amp;A for long-term global growth.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&amp;amp;D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sakana-AI-.png?w=808" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel (IQT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&amp;amp;D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ha, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Looking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships and M&amp;amp;A for long-term global growth.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&amp;amp;D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/sakana-ai-raises-135m-series-b-at-a-2-65b-valuation-to-continue-building-ai-models-for-japan/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:52:07 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
