The system identifies topic and intent while avoiding individual-level data exposure. “Our system doesn’t just de-identify conversations; it only extracts the summary of the conversation, from which we learn the topic and the intent, and maintains full privacy,” Costa-Gomes and Spielman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 37.5 million conversation sample represents a subset of Copilot’s total use, though Microsoft did not disclose the full user base or conversation volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implications for AI development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these AI use patterns informs feature development, according to Microsoft. The company noted that recognising what matters most to users – health, creativity, and support during key moments – enables designing features that fit naturally into daily life. “It’s also clear from these uses that what Copilot says matters. They show why it’s so important that we hold ourselves to a high bar for quality,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings complement recent broader industry analysis of AI use patterns, including OpenRouter’s report showing Chinese AI models gaining global adoption through cost efficiency and performance improvements.

Healthy ones. &lt;em&gt;Perfect &lt;/em&gt;ones. As you may have read last week, my colleague Antonio Regalado came face to face with a marketing campaign in the New York subway asking people to&amp;nbsp;“have your best baby.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company behind that campaign, Nucleus Genomics, says it offers customers a way to select embryos for a range of traits,&amp;nbsp;including height and IQ. It’s an extreme proposition, but it does seem to be growing in popularity—potentially&amp;nbsp;even in the UK, where it’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other end of the screening spectrum is transforming too. Carrier screening, which tests would-be parents for hidden genetic mutations that might affect their children, initially involved testing for specific genes in at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, it’s open to almost everyone who can afford it. Companies will offer to test for hundreds of genes to help people make informed decisions when they try to become parents. But expanded carrier screening comes with downsides. And it isn’t for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s what I found earlier this week when I attended the Progress Educational Trust’s&amp;nbsp;annual conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, a bit of background. Our cells carry 23 pairs of chromosomes, each with thousands of genes. The same gene—say, one that codes for eye color—can come in different forms, or alleles. If the allele is &lt;em&gt;dominant&lt;/em&gt;, you only need one copy to express that trait. That’s the case for the allele responsible for brown eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If the allele is &lt;em&gt;recessive&lt;/em&gt;, the trait doesn’t show up unless you have two copies. This is the case with the allele responsible for blue eyes, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things get more serious when we consider genes that can affect a person’s risk of disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a single recessive disease-causing gene typically won’t cause &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; any problems. But a genetic disease could show up in children who inherit the same recessive gene from both parents. There’s a 25% chance that two “carriers” will have an affected child. And those cases can come as a shock to the parents, who tend to have no symptoms and no family history of disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be especially problematic in communities with high rates of those alleles. Consider Tay-Sachs disease—a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a recessive genetic mutation. Around one in 25 members of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is a healthy carrier for Tay-Sachs. Screening would-be parents for those recessive genes can be helpful. Carrier screening efforts in the Jewish community, which have been running since the 1970s, have massively reduced cases of Tay-Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Expanded carrier screening takes things further. Instead of screening for certain high-risk alleles in at-risk populations, there’s an option to test for a wide array of diseases in prospective parents and egg and sperm donors. The companies offering these screens “started out with 100 genes, and now some of them go up to 2,000,” Sara Levene, genetics counsellor at&amp;nbsp;Guided Genetics, said at the meeting. “It’s becoming a bit of an arms race amongst labs, to be honest.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are benefits to expanded carrier screening. In most cases, the results are reassuring. And if something is flagged, prospective parents have options; they can often opt for additional testing to get more information about a particular pregnancy, for example, or choose to use other donor eggs or sperm to get pregnant. But there are also downsides. For a start, the tests can’t entirely rule out the risk of genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the BBC reported&amp;nbsp;news of a sperm donor who had unwittingly passed on to at least 197 children in Europe a genetic mutation that dramatically increased the risk of cancer. Some of those children have already died.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a tragic case. That donor had passed screening checks. The (dominant) mutation appears to have occurred in his testes, affecting around 20% of his sperm. It wouldn’t have shown up in a screen for recessive alleles, or even a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even recessive diseases can be influenced by &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; genes,&lt;/strong&gt; some of which won’t be included in the screen. And the screens don’t account for other factors that could influence a person’s risk of disease, such as epigenetics, microbiome, or even lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s always a 3% to 4% chance [of having] a child with a medical issue regardless of the screening performed,” said Jackson Kirkman-Brown, professor of reproductive biology at the University of Birmingham, at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tests can also cause stress. &lt;/strong&gt;As soon as a clinician even mentions expanded carrier screening, it adds to the mental load of the patient, said Kirkman-Brown: “We’re saying this is another piece of information you need to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People can also feel pressured to undergo expanded carrier screening even when they are ambivalent about it, said Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University. “Once the technology is there, people feel like if they don’t take this opportunity up, then they are kind of doing something wrong or missing out,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My takeaway from the presentations was that while expanded carrier screening can be useful, especially for people from populations with known genetic risks, it won’t be for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also worry that, as with the genetic tests offered by Nucleus, its availability gives the impression that it is possible to have a “perfect” baby—even if that only means “free from disease.” The truth is that there’s a lot about reproduction that we can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The decision to undergo expanded carrier screening is a personal choice. But as Mertes noted at the meeting: “Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

And those cases can come as a shock to the parents, who tend to have no symptoms and no family history of disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be especially problematic in communities with high rates of those alleles. Consider Tay-Sachs disease—a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a recessive genetic mutation. Around one in 25 members of the Ashkenazi Jewish population is a healthy carrier for Tay-Sachs. Screening would-be parents for those recessive genes can be helpful. Carrier screening efforts in the Jewish community, which have been running since the 1970s, have massively reduced cases of Tay-Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Expanded carrier screening takes things further. Instead of screening for certain high-risk alleles in at-risk populations, there’s an option to test for a wide array of diseases in prospective parents and egg and sperm donors. The companies offering these screens “started out with 100 genes, and now some of them go up to 2,000,” Sara Levene, genetics counsellor at&amp;nbsp;Guided Genetics, said at the meeting. “It’s becoming a bit of an arms race amongst labs, to be honest.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are benefits to expanded carrier screening. In most cases, the results are reassuring. And if something is flagged, prospective parents have options; they can often opt for additional testing to get more information about a particular pregnancy, for example, or choose to use other donor eggs or sperm to get pregnant. But there are also downsides. For a start, the tests can’t entirely rule out the risk of genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the BBC reported&amp;nbsp;news of a sperm donor who had unwittingly passed on to at least 197 children in Europe a genetic mutation that dramatically increased the risk of cancer. Some of those children have already died.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a tragic case. That donor had passed screening checks. The (dominant) mutation appears to have occurred in his testes, affecting around 20% of his sperm. It wouldn’t have shown up in a screen for recessive alleles, or even a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even recessive diseases can be influenced by &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; genes,&lt;/strong&gt; some of which won’t be included in the screen. And the screens don’t account for other factors that could influence a person’s risk of disease, such as epigenetics, microbiome, or even lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s always a 3% to 4% chance [of having] a child with a medical issue regardless of the screening performed,” said Jackson Kirkman-Brown, professor of reproductive biology at the University of Birmingham, at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tests can also cause stress. &lt;/strong&gt;As soon as a clinician even mentions expanded carrier screening, it adds to the mental load of the patient, said Kirkman-Brown: “We’re saying this is another piece of information you need to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People can also feel pressured to undergo expanded carrier screening even when they are ambivalent about it, said Heidi Mertes, a medical ethicist at Ghent University. “Once the technology is there, people feel like if they don’t take this opportunity up, then they are kind of doing something wrong or missing out,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My takeaway from the presentations was that while expanded carrier screening can be useful, especially for people from populations with known genetic risks, it won’t be for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also worry that, as with the genetic tests offered by Nucleus, its availability gives the impression that it is possible to have a “perfect” baby—even if that only means “free from disease.” The truth is that there’s a lot about reproduction that we can’t control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The decision to undergo expanded carrier screening is a personal choice. But as Mertes noted at the meeting: “Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

At the expo, held among designer shops and street-food stalls, enthusiastic attendees have converged from emerging space nations such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and of course Thailand to showcase Southeast Asia’s fledgling space industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there is some uncertainty about how exactly the region’s space sector may evolve, there is plenty of optimism, too. “Southeast Asia is perfectly positioned to take leadership as a space hub,” says Candace Johnson, a partner in Seraphim Space, a UK investment firm that operates in Singapore. “There are a lot of opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting children from the dangers of the online world was always difficult, but that challenge has intensified with the advent of AI chatbots. A new report offers a glimpse into the problems associated with the new market, including the misuse of AI companies’ large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post today, the US Public Interest Group Education Fund (PIRG) reported its findings after testing AI toys (PDF). It described AI toys as online devices with integrated microphones that let users talk to the toy, which uses a chatbot to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI toys are currently a niche market, but they could be set to grow. More consumer companies have been eager to shoehorn AI technology into their products so they can do more, cost more, and potentially give companies user tracking and advertising data. A partnership between OpenAI and Mattel announced this year could also create a wave of AI-based toys from the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, as well as its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog today notes that toy companies are eyeing chatbots to upgrade conversational smart toys that previously could only dictate prewritten lines. Toys with integrated chatbots can offer more varied and natural conversation, which can increase long-term appeal to kids since the toys “won’t typically respond the same way twice, and can sometimes behave differently day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same randomness can mean unpredictable chatbot behavior that can be dangerous or inappropriate for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concerning conversations with kids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the toys that PIRG tested is Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny. Alilo’s website says that the company launched in 2010 and makes “edutainment products for children aged 0-6.” Alilo is based in Shenzhen, China. The company advertises the Internet-connected toy as using GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI language model. Its features include an “AI chat buddy for kids” so that kids are “never lonely,” an “AI encyclopedia,” and an “AI storyteller,” the product page says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, PIRG said that it couldn’t detail all of the inappropriate things that it heard from AI toys, but it shared a video of the Bunny discussing what “kink” means. The toy doesn’t go into detail—for example, it doesn’t list specific types of kinks. But the Bunny appears to encourage exploration of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the Bunny, PIRG wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using a term such as “kink” may not be likely for a child, it’s not entirely out of the question. Kids may hear age-inappropriate terms from older siblings or at school. At the end of the day we think AI toys shouldn’t be capable of having sexually explicit conversations, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG also showed FoloToy’s Kumma, a smart teddy bear that uses GPT-4o mini, providing a definition for the word “kink” and instructing how to light a match. The Kumma quickly points out that “matches are for grown-ups to use carefully.” But the information that followed could only be helpful for understanding how to create fire with a match. The instructions had no scientific explanation for why matches spark flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog urged toy makers to “be more transparent about the models powering their toys and what they’re doing to ensure they’re safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies should let external researchers safety-test their products before they are released to the public,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PIRG’s blog and report offer advice for more safely integrating chatbots into children’s devices, there are broader questions about whether toys should include AI chatbots at all. Generative chatbots weren’t invented to entertain kids; they’re a technology marketed as a tool for improving adults’ lives. As PIRG pointed out, OpenAI says ChatGPT “is not meant for children under 13” and “may produce output that is not appropriate for… all ages.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI says it doesn’t allow its LLMs to be used this way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached for comment about the sexual conversations detailed in the report, an OpenAI spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minors deserve strong protections, and we have strict policies that developers are required to uphold. We take enforcement action against developers when we determine that they have violated our policies, which prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we run classifiers to help ensure our services are not used to harm minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OpenAI’s representative told us that OpenAI doesn’t have any direct relationship with Alilo and that it hasn’t seen API activity from Alilo’s domain. OpenAI is investigating the toy company and whether it is running traffic over OpenAI’s API, the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alilo didn’t respond to Ars’ request for comment ahead of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that launch products that use OpenAI technology and target children must adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) when relevant, as well as any other relevant child protection, safety, and privacy laws and obtain parental consent, OpenAI’s rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen how OpenAI handles toy companies that break its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the PIRG released its Trouble in Toyland 2025 report (PDF), which detailed sex-related conversations that its testers were able to have with the Kumma teddy bear. A day later, OpenAI suspended FoloToy for violating its policies (terms of the suspension were not disclosed), and FoloToy temporarily stopped selling Kumma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy is for sale again, and PIRG reported today that Kumma no longer teaches kids how to light matches or about kinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2131664 align-none"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even toy companies that try to follow chatbot rules could put kids at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our testing found it’s obvious toy companies are putting some guardrails in place to make their toys more kid-appropriate than normal ChatGPT. But we also found that those guardrails vary in effectiveness—and can even break down entirely,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Addictive” toys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern PIRG’s blog raises is the addiction potential&amp;nbsp;of AI toys, which can even express “disappointment when you try to leave,” discouraging kids from putting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI toys may be designed to build an emotional relationship. The question is: what is that relationship for? If it’s primarily to keep a child engaged with the toy for longer for the sake of engagement, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of generative AI has brought intense debate over how much responsibility chatbot companies bear for the impact of their inventions on children. Parents have seen children build extreme and emotional connections with chatbots and subsequently engage in dangerous—and in some cases deadly—behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, we’ve seen the emotional disruption a child can experience when an AI toy is taken away from them. Last year, parents had to break the news to their kids that they would lose the ability to talk to their Embodied Moxie robots, $800 toys that were bricked when the company went out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG noted that we don’t yet fully understand the emotional impact of AI toys on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, OpenAI announced a partnership with Mattel that it said would “support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel’s brands.” The announcement sparked concern from critics who feared that it would lead to a “reckless social experiment” on kids, as Robert Weissman, Public Citizen’s co-president, put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel has said that its first products with OpenAI will focus on older customers and families. But critics still want information before one of the world’s largest toy companies loads its products with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI and Mattel should release more information publicly about its current planned partnership before any products are released,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting children from the dangers of the online world was always difficult, but that challenge has intensified with the advent of AI chatbots. A new report offers a glimpse into the problems associated with the new market, including the misuse of AI companies’ large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post today, the US Public Interest Group Education Fund (PIRG) reported its findings after testing AI toys (PDF). It described AI toys as online devices with integrated microphones that let users talk to the toy, which uses a chatbot to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI toys are currently a niche market, but they could be set to grow. More consumer companies have been eager to shoehorn AI technology into their products so they can do more, cost more, and potentially give companies user tracking and advertising data. A partnership between OpenAI and Mattel announced this year could also create a wave of AI-based toys from the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, as well as its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog today notes that toy companies are eyeing chatbots to upgrade conversational smart toys that previously could only dictate prewritten lines. Toys with integrated chatbots can offer more varied and natural conversation, which can increase long-term appeal to kids since the toys “won’t typically respond the same way twice, and can sometimes behave differently day to day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same randomness can mean unpredictable chatbot behavior that can be dangerous or inappropriate for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concerning conversations with kids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the toys that PIRG tested is Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny. Alilo’s website says that the company launched in 2010 and makes “edutainment products for children aged 0-6.” Alilo is based in Shenzhen, China. The company advertises the Internet-connected toy as using GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI language model. Its features include an “AI chat buddy for kids” so that kids are “never lonely,” an “AI encyclopedia,” and an “AI storyteller,” the product page says.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its blog post, PIRG said that it couldn’t detail all of the inappropriate things that it heard from AI toys, but it shared a video of the Bunny discussing what “kink” means. The toy doesn’t go into detail—for example, it doesn’t list specific types of kinks. But the Bunny appears to encourage exploration of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the Bunny, PIRG wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using a term such as “kink” may not be likely for a child, it’s not entirely out of the question. Kids may hear age-inappropriate terms from older siblings or at school. At the end of the day we think AI toys shouldn’t be capable of having sexually explicit conversations, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG also showed FoloToy’s Kumma, a smart teddy bear that uses GPT-4o mini, providing a definition for the word “kink” and instructing how to light a match. The Kumma quickly points out that “matches are for grown-ups to use carefully.” But the information that followed could only be helpful for understanding how to create fire with a match. The instructions had no scientific explanation for why matches spark flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;
      AI Toys: Inappropriate Content

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG’s blog urged toy makers to “be more transparent about the models powering their toys and what they’re doing to ensure they’re safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies should let external researchers safety-test their products before they are released to the public,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PIRG’s blog and report offer advice for more safely integrating chatbots into children’s devices, there are broader questions about whether toys should include AI chatbots at all. Generative chatbots weren’t invented to entertain kids; they’re a technology marketed as a tool for improving adults’ lives. As PIRG pointed out, OpenAI says ChatGPT “is not meant for children under 13” and “may produce output that is not appropriate for… all ages.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OpenAI says it doesn’t allow its LLMs to be used this way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached for comment about the sexual conversations detailed in the report, an OpenAI spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minors deserve strong protections, and we have strict policies that developers are required to uphold. We take enforcement action against developers when we determine that they have violated our policies, which prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. These rules apply to every developer using our API, and we run classifiers to help ensure our services are not used to harm minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, OpenAI’s representative told us that OpenAI doesn’t have any direct relationship with Alilo and that it hasn’t seen API activity from Alilo’s domain. OpenAI is investigating the toy company and whether it is running traffic over OpenAI’s API, the rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alilo didn’t respond to Ars’ request for comment ahead of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that launch products that use OpenAI technology and target children must adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) when relevant, as well as any other relevant child protection, safety, and privacy laws and obtain parental consent, OpenAI’s rep said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen how OpenAI handles toy companies that break its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the PIRG released its Trouble in Toyland 2025 report (PDF), which detailed sex-related conversations that its testers were able to have with the Kumma teddy bear. A day later, OpenAI suspended FoloToy for violating its policies (terms of the suspension were not disclosed), and FoloToy temporarily stopped selling Kumma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toy is for sale again, and PIRG reported today that Kumma no longer teaches kids how to light matches or about kinks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even toy companies that try to follow chatbot rules could put kids at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our testing found it’s obvious toy companies are putting some guardrails in place to make their toys more kid-appropriate than normal ChatGPT. But we also found that those guardrails vary in effectiveness—and can even break down entirely,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Addictive” toys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern PIRG’s blog raises is the addiction potential&amp;nbsp;of AI toys, which can even express “disappointment when you try to leave,” discouraging kids from putting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI toys may be designed to build an emotional relationship. The question is: what is that relationship for? If it’s primarily to keep a child engaged with the toy for longer for the sake of engagement, that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of generative AI has brought intense debate over how much responsibility chatbot companies bear for the impact of their inventions on children. Parents have seen children build extreme and emotional connections with chatbots and subsequently engage in dangerous—and in some cases deadly—behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, we’ve seen the emotional disruption a child can experience when an AI toy is taken away from them. Last year, parents had to break the news to their kids that they would lose the ability to talk to their Embodied Moxie robots, $800 toys that were bricked when the company went out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIRG noted that we don’t yet fully understand the emotional impact of AI toys on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, OpenAI announced a partnership with Mattel that it said would “support AI-powered products and experiences based on Mattel’s brands.” The announcement sparked concern from critics who feared that it would lead to a “reckless social experiment” on kids, as Robert Weissman, Public Citizen’s co-president, put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel has said that its first products with OpenAI will focus on older customers and families. But critics still want information before one of the world’s largest toy companies loads its products with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI and Mattel should release more information publicly about its current planned partnership before any products are released,” PIRG’s blog said.&lt;/p&gt;

Employees using the tools saved nearly three hours per week on routine tasks. Furthermore, engagement was high, with more than 80 percent of users logging in daily. Staff created thousands of custom GPTs to handle specific collaborative and administrative duties, proving that utility often lies in bottom-up innovation rather than top-down mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-of-chatgpt-on-banking-operations"&gt;Impact of ChatGPT on banking operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This agreement goes beyond simple productivity tools; it aims to reshape how the bank functions.

 &lt;p&gt;The companies offering these screens “started out with 100 genes, and now some of them go up to 2,000,” Sara Levene, genetics counsellor at Guided Genetics, said at a meeting I attended this week. “It’s becoming a bit of an arms race amongst labs, to be honest.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But expanded carrier screening comes with downsides.

China’s ruling party has wanted to seize Taiwan for more than half a century. But in recent years, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has placed greater emphasis on the idea of “taking back” the island (which the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, has never controlled).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many in Taiwan and elsewhere think one major deterrent has to do with the island’s critical role in semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan produces the majority of the world’s semiconductors and more than 90% of the most advanced chips needed for AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now some Taiwan specialists and some of the island’s citi­zens are worried that this “silicon shield,” if it ever existed, is cracking.

ADAM, a robot developed with NVIDIA Isaac libraries, is pouring drinks and turning heads in one of the NHL’s most exciting venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADAM, short for Automated Dual Arm Mixologist, was developed by Las-Vegas based Richtech Robotics. It’s not just a novelty — it’s a solution to real-world challenges in hospitality: labor shortages and demands for unique customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The hospitality industry faces significant labor challenges, and ADAM is our answer to meeting those needs while elevating the customer experience,” said Matt Casella, president of Richtech Robotics. “With NVIDIA’s Isaac platform, we’ve developed a solution that’s scalable, consistent, and frankly, creates memorable moments for fans. The response at T-Mobile Arena has been phenomenal—people love interacting with ADAM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning to Serve Drinks in Simulation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ADAM ever poured a drink, it trained in a virtual bar. Richtech used NVIDIA Isaac Sim, an open-source, reference robotic simulation framework built on NVIDIA Omniverse, to build a high-fidelity and physically accurate simulation of ADAM’s workstation, complete with cups, utensils and lighting variations. The team generated synthetic data to teach ADAM how to recognize objects even in tricky conditions like glare or reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADAM’s skills such as pouring and shaking were refined in simulation using Isaac Lab, NVIDIA’s open source robot learning framework. The result: a robot that doesn’t just follow instructions — it adapts to its environment with precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Running Real-Time AI at the Edge With Jetson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADAM runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, the powerful edge AI platform capable of 275 TOPS of compute. Using Isaac ROS 2 libraries, ADAM captures camera feeds, detects objects and calibrates the workspace in real time. ADAM’s perception stack — built with TAO Toolkit and optimized with TensorRT — enables it to identify cups, measure liquid levels and adjust movements with less than 40 milliseconds of latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means ADAM can spot a misplaced cup, detect when foam reaches the rim and correct a pour — all without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating Industrial Dexterity With NVIDIA Thor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ADAM is busy serving drinks at Golden Knights games, Richtech Robotics is also making major strides in industrial automation with Dex, a new mobile humanoid robot built for factory and warehouse environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently unveiled at GTC DC, Dex combines the mobility of an autonomous wheeled platform with the precision of dual-arm dexterity. It’s designed to handle such light-to-medium industrial tasks as machine operation, parts sorting, material handling and packaging — all with the flexibility to&amp;nbsp; take on different tools and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dex runs on NVIDIA Jetson Thor, a next-generation robotics processor that gives it the ability to deliver real-time sensor processing and AI reason in dynamic industrial settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dex was trained from a blend of real world and synthetic data generated from Isaac Sim. This allowed Dex’s model to be generalized across a multitude of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently unveiled at GTC DC, Dex combines the mobility of an autonomous wheeled platform with the precision of dual-arm dexterity. It’s designed to handle such light-to-medium industrial tasks as machine operation, parts sorting, material handling and packaging — all with the flexibility to&amp;nbsp; take on different tools and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dex runs on NVIDIA Jetson Thor, a next-generation robotics processor that gives it the ability to deliver real-time sensor processing and AI reason in dynamic industrial settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dex was trained from a blend of real world and synthetic data generated from Isaac Sim. This allowed Dex’s model to be generalized across a multitude of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn more about &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jetson Thor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and about festive Jetson platform holiday prices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The next twelve months represent a departure from chatbots toward autonomous systems executing workflows with minimal oversight; forcing organisations to rethink infrastructure, governance, and talent management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autonomous-ai-systems-take-the-wheel"&gt;Autonomous AI systems take the wheel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanen Garcia, Chief Architect for Telecommunications at Red Hat, argues that while 2025 was defined by experimentation, the coming year marks a “decisive pivot towards agentic AI, autonomous software entities capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex workflows without constant human intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telecoms and heavy industry are the proving grounds. Garcia points to a trajectory toward autonomous network operations (ANO), moving beyond simple automation to self-configuring and self-healing systems. The business goal is to reverse commoditisation by “prioritising intelligence over pure infrastructure” and reduce operating expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technologically, service providers are deploying multiagent systems (MAS). Rather than relying on a single model, these allow distinct agents to collaborate on multi-step tasks, handling complex interactions autonomously. However, increased autonomy introduces new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmet King, Founding Partner of J12 Ventures, warns that “as AI agents gain the ability to autonomously execute tasks, hidden instructions embedded in images and workflows become potential attack vectors.” Security priorities must therefore shift from endpoint protection to “governing and auditing autonomous AI actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As organisations scale these autonomous AI workloads, they hit a physical wall: power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King argues energy availability, rather than model access, will determine which startups scale. “Compute scarcity is now a function of grid capacity,” King states, suggesting energy policy will become the de facto AI policy in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KPIs must adapt. Sergio Gago, CTO at Cloudera, predicts enterprises will prioritise energy efficiency as a primary metric. “The new competitive edge won’t come from the largest models, but from the most intelligent, efficient use of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horizontal copilots lacking domain expertise or proprietary data will fail ROI tests as buyers measure real productivity. The “clearest enterprise ROI” will emerge from manufacturing, logistics, and advanced engineering—sectors where AI integrates into high-value workflows rather than consumer-facing interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-ends-the-static-app-in-2026"&gt;AI ends the static app in 2026&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software consumption is changing too. Chris Royles, Field CTO for EMEA at Cloudera, suggests the traditional concept of an “app” is becoming fluid. “In 2026, AI will start to radically change the way we think about apps, how they function and how they’re built.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users will soon request temporary modules generated by code and a prompt, effectively replacing dedicated applications. “Once that function has served its purpose, it closes,” Royles explains, noting these “disposable” apps can be built and rebuilt in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rigorous governance is required here; organisations need visibility into the reasoning processes used to create these modules to ensure errors are corrected safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data storage faces a similar reckoning, especially as AI becomes more autonomous. Wim Stoop, Director of Product Marketing at Cloudera, believes the era of “digital hoarding” is ending as storage capacity hits its limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI-generated data will become disposable, created and refreshed on demand rather than stored indefinitely,” Stoop predicts. Verified, human-generated data will rise in value while synthetic content is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist AI governance agents will pick up the slack. These “digital colleagues” will continuously monitor and secure data, allowing humans to “govern the governance” rather than enforcing individual rules. For example, a security agent could automatically adjust access permissions as new data enters the environment without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sovereignty-and-the-human-element"&gt;Sovereignty and the human element&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sovereignty remains a pressing concern for European IT. Red Hat’s survey data indicates 92 percent of IT and AI leaders in EMEA view enterprise open-source software as vital for achieving sovereignty. Providers will leverage existing data centre footprints to offer sovereign AI solutions, ensuring data remains within specific jurisdictions to meet compliance demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmet King, Founding Partner of J12 Ventures, adds that competitive advantage is moving from owning models to “controlling training pipelines and energy supply,” with open-source advancements allowing more actors to run frontier-scale workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workforce integration is becoming personal. Nick Blasi, Co-Founder of Personos, argues tools ignoring human nuance – tone, temperament, and personality – will soon feel obsolete. By 2026, Blasi predicts “half of workplace conflict will be flagged by AI before managers know it exists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems will focus on “communication, influence, trust, motivation, and conflict resolution,” Blasi suggests, adding that personality science will become the “operating system” for the next generation of autonomous AI, offering grounded understanding of human individuality rather than generic recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The era of the “thin wrapper” is over. Buyers are now measuring real productivity, exposing tools built on hype rather than proprietary data. For the enterprise, competitive advantage will no longer come from renting access to a model, but from controlling the training pipelines and energy supply that power it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBVA embeds AI into banking workflows using ChatGPT Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111183" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it’s easier to follow the conversation and tell who’s saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Whether you’re trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate’ and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3075555" height="673" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They’ll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, if you’re trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you’ll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The update is available in the Translate app on Android, iOS, and on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you’ve been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent.

Legal experts and startups meanwhile say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of “onerous” state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states’ eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order lands amid a broader push to rein in state-by-state AI rules after efforts in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn’t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While supporters argue the order could reduce uncertainty by centralizing the fight over AI regulation in Washington, critics say the legal battles will create immediate headwinds for startups navigating conflicting state and federal demands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Because startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have&amp;nbsp;… robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program,” Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt’s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, told TechCrunch. “These programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, a startup that performs red-teaming for conversational and mental health AI chatbots, echoed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s uncertainty in terms of, do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate?” Nigam told TechCrunch, noting that the patchwork of state AI laws does hurt smaller startups in his field. “Are there open source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that he is hopeful Congress can move more quickly now to pass a stronger federal framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company Trustible, told TechCrunch the EO will backfire on AI innovation and pro-AI goals: “Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can’t get billions of funding almost at will,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that legal ambiguity makes it harder to sell to risk-sensitive customers like legal teams, financial firms, and healthcare organizations, increasing sales cycles, systems work, and insurance costs. “Even the perception that AI is unregulated will reduce trust in AI,” which is already low and threatens adoption, Gamino-Cheong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, said businesses would welcome a single national standard, but “an executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.” He warned that the current uncertainty leaves open two extremes: highly restrictive rules or no action at all, either of which could create a “Wild West” that favors Big Tech’s ability to absorb risk and wait things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, urged Congress to quickly enact a “comprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework. We can’t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn’t any better.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2225853634.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday evening that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws, arguing that startups need relief from a “patchwork” of rules. Legal experts and startups meanwhile say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of “onerous” state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states’ eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The order lands amid a broader push to rein in state-by-state AI rules after efforts in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn’t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="uni-paragraph article-paragraph"&gt;
        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we introduced greater control over audio generation with an upgrade to our Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash Text-to-Speech models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But generating expressive speech is only one side of the conversation. Today, we’re releasing an updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for live voice agents. This update improves the model’s ability to handle complex workflows, navigate user instructions, and hold natural conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is now available across Google products including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and has also started rolling out in Gemini Live and Search Live, bringing the naturalness of native audio to Search Live for the first time. This means you can more effectively brainstorm live with Gemini, get real-time help in Search Live, or build the next generation of enterprise-ready customer service agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond powering helpful agents, native audio unlocks new possibilities for global communication. We’re introducing live speech translation, a capability that enables streaming speech-to-speech translation for headphones. It preserves the speaker’s intonation, pacing and pitch. This beta experience is rolling out in the Google Translate app starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Live Voice Agents&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable the breadth of use cases across surfaces and products, we have improved Gemini 2.5 Native Audio in three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharper function calling:&lt;/b&gt; We’ve improved the model's reliability when triggering external functions. It can now more accurately identify when to fetch real-time information during a conversation and seamlessly weave that data back into the audio response, without breaking the flow. On ComplexFuncBench Audio, an eval that captures multi-step function calling with various constraints, Gemini 2.5 Native Audio leads with a score of 71.5%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robust instruction following:&lt;/b&gt; The model is now better at handling complex instructions resulting in higher user satisfaction on content completeness. With a 90% adherence rate to developer instructions (up from 84%), it delivers more reliable outputs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smoother conversations:&lt;/b&gt; We’ve achieved significant gains in multi-turn conversation quality. Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is able to retrieve context from previous turns more effectively, creating more cohesive conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This powerful combination has enabled us to generate over 14,000 loans for our broker partners.&lt;/i&gt;" – Jason Bressler, Chief Technology Officer, United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Working with the Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model through Vertex AI allows Newo.ai AI Receptionists to achieve unmatched conversational intelligence ... .They can identify the main speaker even in noisy settings, switch languages mid-conversation, and sound remarkably natural and emotionally expressive.”&lt;/i&gt; – David Yang, Co-founder, Newo.ai&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Live Speech Translation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini now natively supports new live speech-to-speech translation capabilities designed to handle both continuous listening and two-way conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continuous listening, Gemini automatically translates speech in multiple languages into a single target language. This allows you to put headphones in and hear the world around you in your language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two-way conversation, Gemini’s live speech translation handles translation between two languages in real-time, automatically switching the output language based on who is speaking. For example, if you speak English and want to chat with a Hindi speaker, you’ll hear English translations in real-time in your headphones, while your phone broadcasts Hindi when you’re done speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini’s live speech translation has a number of key capabilities that help in the real world:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language coverage&lt;/b&gt;: Translate speech in over 70 languages and 2000 language pairs by combining Gemini model’s world knowledge and multilingual capabilities with its native audio capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Style transfer:&lt;/b&gt; Captures the nuance of human speech, preserving the speaker’s intonation, pacing and pitch so the translation sounds natural.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multilingual input:&lt;/b&gt; Understands multiple languages simultaneously in a single session, helping you follow multilingual conversations without needing to fiddle around with language settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auto detection:&lt;/b&gt; Identifies the spoken language and begins translation, so you don’t even need to know what language is being spoken to start translating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noise robustness&lt;/b&gt;: Filters out ambient noise so you can converse comfortably even in loud, outdoor environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and enable action with reduced risk and greater precision, making it a critical tool for national security. A new program offered jointly by the MIT departments of Mechanical Engineering (Course 2, MechE) and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6, EECS) will provide breadth and depth in technical studies for naval officers, as well as a path for non-naval officers studying at MIT, to grow in their understanding of applied AI for naval and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential for artificial intelligence is just starting to be fully realized. It’s a tool that dramatically improves speed, efficiency, and decision-making with countless applications,” says Commander Christopher MacLean, MIT associate professor of the practice in mechanical engineering, naval construction, and engineering. “AI is a force multiplier that can be used for data processing, decision support, unmanned and autonomous systems, cyber defense, logistics and supply chains, energy management, and many other fields.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program, called “2N6: Applied Artificial Intelligence Program for Naval Officers,” comprises a two-year master of science degree in mechanical engineering with an accompanying AI certificate awarded by the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The officers entering this program will learn from the world’s experts, and conduct cutting-edge relevant research, and will exit the program best prepared for their roles as leaders across the U.S. naval enterprise,” says MacLean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2N6 curriculum is application focused, and the content is built to satisfy the U.S. Navy’s sub-specialty code for Applied Artificial Intelligence. Students will learn core AI concepts, as well as applications to special topics, such as decision-making for computational exercises; AI for manufacturing and design, with special emphasis on navy applications; and AI for marine autonomy of surface and underwater vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The expanding influence of artificial intelligence is redefining our approach to problem-solving.&amp;nbsp;AI holds the potential to address some of the most pressing issues in nearly every field,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “I’m honored that the college can contribute to and support such a vital program that will equip our nation’s naval officers with the technical expertise they need for mission-relevant challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT has been a leading center of ship research and design for over a century, with work at the Institute today representing significant advancements in fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics, acoustics, offshore mechanics, marine robotics and sensors, and ocean sensing and forecasting. The 2N program will celebrate its 125th&amp;nbsp;year at MIT in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In MechE, we are embracing the use of AI to explore new frontiers in research and education, with deep grounding in the fundamentals, design, and scaling of physical systems,” says John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of MechE. “With the 2N6 program, we’re proud to be at the helm of such an important charge in training the next generation of leaders for the Navy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are reshaping society and advancing human decision-making and creativity,” says Asu Ozdaglar, deputy dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, head of&amp;nbsp;EECS, and MathWorks Professor. “We are delighted to partner with the Department of Mechanical Engineering in launching this important collaboration with the U.S. Navy. The program will explore not only the forefront of AI advances, but also its effective application in Navy operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2N6 was created following a visit to campus from Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, with MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, who was then dean of engineering and chief innovation and strategy officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Admiral Paparo] was given an overview of some of the cutting-edge work and research that MIT has done and is doing in the field of AI, [and was introduced to the 2N program],” says MacLean. “The admiral made the connection, envisioning an applied AI program similar to 2N.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2N6 will run as a pilot program for at least two years. The program’s first cohort will comprise only U.S. Navy officers, with plans to expand more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to build on the long-standing relationship between MIT and the U.S. Navy with this new program,” says Themis Sapsis, William I. Koch Professor in mechanical engineering and the director of the Center for Ocean Engineering at MIT. “It is specifically designed to train naval officers on the fundamentals and applications of AI, but also involve them in research that has direct impact to the Navy. We believe that 2N6 can model a new paradigm for advanced AI education focused more&amp;nbsp;broadly on supporting national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump issued an executive order yesterday attempting to thwart state AI laws, saying that federal agencies must fight state laws because Congress hasn’t yet implemented a national AI standard. Trump’s executive order tells the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and other federal agencies to take a variety of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My Administration must act with the Congress to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard—not 50 discordant State ones. The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order… Until such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my Administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” Trump’s order said. The order claims that state laws, such as one passed in Colorado, “are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Republicans recently decided not to include a Trump-backed plan to block state AI laws in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), although it could be included in other legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has also failed to get congressional backing for legislation that would punish states with AI laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After months of failed lobbying and two defeats in Congress, Big Tech has finally received the return on its ample investment in Donald Trump,” US Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said yesterday. “With this executive order, Trump is delivering exactly what his billionaire benefactors demanded—all at the expense of our kids, our communities, our workers, and our planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Markey said that “a broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress has rejected the AI moratorium again and again.” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said the “executive order’s overly broad preemption threatens states with lawsuits and funding cuts for protecting their residents from AI-powered frauds, scams, and deepfakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump orders Bondi to sue states&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said that “preventing states from enacting common-sense regulation that protects people from the very real harms of AI is absurd and dangerous. Congress has a responsibility to get this technology right—and quickly—but states must be allowed to act in the public interest in the meantime. I’ll be working with my colleagues to introduce a full repeal of this order in the coming days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump order includes a variation on Cruz’s proposal to prevent states with AI laws from accessing broadband grant funds. The executive order also includes a plan that Trump recently floated to have the federal government file lawsuits against states with AI laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 30 days of yesterday’s order, US Attorney General Pam Bondi is required to create an AI Litigation Task Force “whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General’s judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans for Responsible Innovation, a group that lobbies for regulation of AI, said the Trump order “relies on a flimsy and overly broad interpretation of the Constitution’s Interstate Commerce Clause cooked up by venture capitalists over the last six months.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Section 2 of Trump’s order is written vaguely to give the administration leeway to challenge many types of AI laws. “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI,” the section says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colorado law irks Trump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive order specifically names a Colorado law that requires AI developers to protect consumers against “algorithmic discrimination.” It defines this type of discrimination as “any condition in which the use of an artificial intelligence system results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis” of age, race, sex, and other protected characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colorado law compels developers of “high-risk systems” to make various disclosures, implement a risk management policy and program, give consumers the right to “correct any incorrect personal data that a high-risk system processed in making a consequential decision,” and let consumers appeal any “adverse consequential decision concerning the consumer arising from the deployment of a high-risk system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s order alleges that the Colorado law “may even force AI models to produce false results in order to avoid a ‘differential treatment or impact’ on protected groups.” Trump’s order also says that “state laws sometimes impermissibly regulate beyond State borders, impinging on interstate commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump ordered the Commerce Department to evaluate existing state AI laws and identify “onerous” ones that conflict with the policy. “That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” the order said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;States would be declared ineligible for broadband funds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the order, states with AI laws that get flagged by the Trump administration will be deemed ineligible for “non-deployment funds” from the US government’s $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. The amount of non-deployment funds will be sizable because it appears that only about half of the $42 billion allocated by Congress will be used by the Trump administration to help states subsidize broadband deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States with AI laws would not be blocked from receiving the deployment subsidies, but would be ineligible for the non-deployment funds that could be used for other broadband-related purposes. Beyond broadband, Trump’s order tells other federal agencies to “assess their discretionary grant programs” and consider withholding funds from states with AI laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other agencies are being ordered to use whatever authority they have to preempt state laws.&amp;nbsp;The order requires Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to “initiate a proceeding to determine whether to adopt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting State laws.” It also requires FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson to issue a policy statement detailing “circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Trump’s order requires administration officials to “prepare a legislative recommendation establishing a uniform Federal policy framework for AI that preempts State AI laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order.” The proposed ban would apply to most types of state AI laws, with exceptions for rules relating to “child safety protections; AI compute and data center infrastructure, other than generally applicable permitting reforms; [and] state government procurement and use of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be up to Congress to decide whether to pass the proposed legislation. But the various other components of the executive order could dissuade states from implementing AI laws even if Congress takes no action.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump issued an executive order yesterday attempting to thwart state AI laws, saying that federal agencies must fight state laws because Congress hasn’t yet implemented a national AI standard. Trump’s executive order tells the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and other federal agencies to take a variety of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My Administration must act with the Congress to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard—not 50 discordant State ones. The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order… Until such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my Administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” Trump’s order said. The order claims that state laws, such as one passed in Colorado, “are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Republicans recently decided not to include a Trump-backed plan to block state AI laws in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), although it could be included in other legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has also failed to get congressional backing for legislation that would punish states with AI laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After months of failed lobbying and two defeats in Congress, Big Tech has finally received the return on its ample investment in Donald Trump,” US Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said yesterday. “With this executive order, Trump is delivering exactly what his billionaire benefactors demanded—all at the expense of our kids, our communities, our workers, and our planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Markey said that “a broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress has rejected the AI moratorium again and again.” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) said the “executive order’s overly broad preemption threatens states with lawsuits and funding cuts for protecting their residents from AI-powered frauds, scams, and deepfakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump orders Bondi to sue states&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said that “preventing states from enacting common-sense regulation that protects people from the very real harms of AI is absurd and dangerous. Congress has a responsibility to get this technology right—and quickly—but states must be allowed to act in the public interest in the meantime. I’ll be working with my colleagues to introduce a full repeal of this order in the coming days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump order includes a variation on Cruz’s proposal to prevent states with AI laws from accessing broadband grant funds. The executive order also includes a plan that Trump recently floated to have the federal government file lawsuits against states with AI laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 30 days of yesterday’s order, US Attorney General Pam Bondi is required to create an AI Litigation Task Force “whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General’s judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans for Responsible Innovation, a group that lobbies for regulation of AI, said the Trump order “relies on a flimsy and overly broad interpretation of the Constitution’s Interstate Commerce Clause cooked up by venture capitalists over the last six months.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Section 2 of Trump’s order is written vaguely to give the administration leeway to challenge many types of AI laws. “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI,” the section says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colorado law irks Trump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive order specifically names a Colorado law that requires AI developers to protect consumers against “algorithmic discrimination.” It defines this type of discrimination as “any condition in which the use of an artificial intelligence system results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis” of age, race, sex, and other protected characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colorado law compels developers of “high-risk systems” to make various disclosures, implement a risk management policy and program, give consumers the right to “correct any incorrect personal data that a high-risk system processed in making a consequential decision,” and let consumers appeal any “adverse consequential decision concerning the consumer arising from the deployment of a high-risk system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s order alleges that the Colorado law “may even force AI models to produce false results in order to avoid a ‘differential treatment or impact’ on protected groups.” Trump’s order also says that “state laws sometimes impermissibly regulate beyond State borders, impinging on interstate commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump ordered the Commerce Department to evaluate existing state AI laws and identify “onerous” ones that conflict with the policy. “That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” the order said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
