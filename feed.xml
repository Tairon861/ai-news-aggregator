In August 2025, Gartner positioned Huawei in the Leaders quadrant of its Magic Quadrant for Container Management, recognising the company’s deep expertise and strategic investments in Cloud Native 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recognition validates Huawei’s infrastructure capabilities that will underpin Malaysia’s AI ambitions. The company’s container products, including CCE Turbo, CCE Autopilot, Cloud Container Instance (CCI), and the distributed cloud-native service UCS, provide the optimal cloud-native infrastructure for managing large-scale, scalable containerised workloads in public clouds, distributed clouds, hybrid clouds, and edge environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies (Malaysia) CEO Simon Sun outlined the scope of the Malaysia AI talent development initiative, which targets a diverse range of professionals, including students, government officials, industry leaders, think tanks, and associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have set the goal of nurturing 30,000 Malaysian AI talents, comprising students, government officials, industry leaders, think tanks, associations, and others under this initiative in the coming three years,” Sun announced during the summit attended by approximately 300 regional delegates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical foundation for AI excellence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei Cloud’s technical capabilities position it well to support Malaysia’s AI workforce development. The company operates a global network of 34 regions and 101 availability zones, including five regions and 17 availability zones specifically in ASEAN, providing the low-latency infrastructure essential for AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform supports more than 160 open-source models through its AI Cloud Service, offering flexibility for development in different industries. At the core is Huawei’s Pangu multimodal models, which form the backbone of the company’s “AI for Industries” strategy, delivering tailored solutions for manufacturing, healthcare, transport, and other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li Yin, CTO of Huawei Cloud Enterprise Intelligence, demonstrated how these capabilities translate into real-world applications during her session “Leap to Cloud, Heading to AI.” She shared examples of Huawei Cloud’s work with customers in more than 30 industries, applying AI to over 500 scenarios worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talent development programme builds on Huawei’s existing ICT Academy and AI Talent Development Plan, which the Digital Minister commended for “nurturing a highly skilled, future-ready workforce equipped with industry-relevant expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond training, Huawei is also committed to nurturing 200 local AI partners through knowledge transfers and cloud solution collaborations with top AI companies. The initiative includes encouraging AI investments in Malaysia and supporting the inception of new Malaysian AI entities through partnerships with local players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud Native 2.0 and AI integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s advancement in Cloud Native 2.0 technology, which has been fully upgraded to incorporate intelligence, directly supports Malaysia’s AI ambitions. The company is building next-generation AI-native cloud infrastructure powered by advanced AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key innovations include CCE AI clusters that form the cloud-native infrastructure for CloudMatrix384 supernodes, offering large-scale supernode topology-aware scheduling, AI workload characteristic-aware auto-scaling, and ultra-fast container startups that significantly accelerate AI training and inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei has also introduced CCE Doer, which integrates AI agents throughout the container use process, providing intelligent Q&amp;amp;A, recommendations, and diagnostics. The system can diagnose over 200 critical exception scenarios with a root cause accuracy rate exceeding 80%, enabling automated and intelligent container cluster management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;National policy framework supports AI growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talent development announcement came as Malaysia unveiled its NCCP, establishing a comprehensive framework for cloud adoption that directly supports AI capabilities development. The policy targets Malaysia’s aim to become a world-class cloud computing hub by 2030, anchored on innovation, cybersecurity, sustainability, and inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gobind highlighted that building an “AI nation” under the 13th Malaysia Plan necessitates strengthening infrastructure, enhancing security, and developing local talent, with collaboration playing a pivotal role in achieving these objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we speak of infrastructure, security and talent, there is much we can learn from industry and our friends in the region and globally about how other countries, sectors and industries have developed,” the minister noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Real-world applications drive adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Malaysia AI talent development initiative aims to address existing applications where AI is already making an impact. Sun pointed to fraud detection in banking, predictive maintenance in factories, supply chain management, and personalised learning in schools as areas where skilled professionals are increasingly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s approach emphasises localised partnerships to ensure global expertise is applied in ways that suit ASEAN’s specific needs. The company showcased its AI-Native cloud infrastructure built in collaboration with local partners, demonstrating how such partnerships can drive intelligent, sector-wide upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Governance and security priorities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Digital Minister emphasised the critical importance of governance and regulatory frameworks to ensure AI adoption remains safe and sustainable, particularly as Malaysia becomes more dependent on data-driven infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you build a country that is fully dependent on data and data centres, then we cannot afford to have a breakdown that impacts all sectors that rely on them,” Gobind warned, highlighting the need for robust infrastructure and security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s approach includes preparing policies and legislation that can adapt to new technologies while ensuring safety and security are not compromised. The National AI Office, established in December 2024, has already worked with six sectors and identified 55 AI potential use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regional implications and future outlook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Malaysia AI talent development initiative carries significant implications for the broader ASEAN region, where skilled AI professionals remain in short supply. Huawei’s investment in local capabilities, backed by its Gartner-recognised infrastructure leadership, could position Malaysia as a regional hub for AI expertise, potentially attracting additional technology investments and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The future is now. We need to start thinking today about how to build an ecosystem that will ensure that, in five years, when new technology is rolled out, Malaysia is ready for it,” Gobind concluded, emphasising the urgency of preparing for rapid technological change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convergence of Huawei’s talent development commitment with Malaysia’s new cloud computing policy framework represents a significant step toward building indigenous AI capabilities while maintaining strategic partnerships with global technology leaders. Success will depend on effective implementation and ensuring the benefits reach all segments of Malaysian society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Panos Sakalakis)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Can Huawei’s open-sourced CANN toolkit break the CUDA monopoly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Skinner led his own secret government project to win World War II.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner did not aim to build a new class of larger, more destructive weapons. Rather, he wanted to make conventional bombs more precise. The idea struck him as he gazed out the window of his train on the way to an academic conference. “I saw a flock of birds lifting and wheeling in formation as they flew alongside the train,” he wrote. “Suddenly I saw them as ‘devices’ with excellent vision and maneuverability. Could they not guide a missile?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skinner started his missile research with crows, but the brainy black birds proved intractable. So he went to a local shop that sold pigeons to Chinese restaurants, and “Project Pigeon” was born. Though ordinary pigeons, &lt;em&gt;Columba livia&lt;/em&gt;, were no one’s idea of clever animals, they proved remarkably cooperative subjects in the lab. Skinner rewarded the birds with food for pecking at the right target on aerial photographs—and eventually planned to strap the birds into a device in the nose of a warhead, which they would steer by pecking at the target on a live image projected through a lens onto a screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The military never deployed Skinner’s kamikaze pigeons, but his experiments convinced him that the pigeon was “an extremely reliable instrument” for studying the underlying processes of learning. “We have used pigeons, not because the pigeon is an intelligent bird, but because it is a practical one and can be made into a machine,” he said in 1944.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test. But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is Skinner’s research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century. Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings. His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These companies’ programs are increasingly incorporating a kind of machine learning whose core concept—reinforcement—is taken directly from Skinner’s school of psychology and whose main architects, the computer scientists Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, won the 2024 Turing Award, an honor widely considered to be the Nobel Prize of computer science. Reinforcement learning has helped enable computers to drive cars, solve complex math problems, and defeat grandmasters in games like chess and Go—but it has not done so by emulating the complex workings of the human mind. Rather, it has supercharged the simple associative processes of the pigeon brain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s a “bitter lesson” of 70 years of AI research, Sutton has written: that human intelligence has not worked as a model for machine learning—instead, the lowly principles of associative learning are what power the algorithms that can now simulate or outperform humans on a variety of tasks. If artificial intelligence really is close to throwing off the yoke of its creators, as many people fear, then our computer overlords may be less like ourselves than like “rats with wings”—and planet-size brains. And even if it’s not, the pigeon brain can at least help demystify a technology that many worry (or rejoice) is “becoming human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In turn, the recent accomplishments of AI are now prompting some animal researchers to rethink the evolution of natural intelligence. Johan Lind, a biologist at Stockholm University, has written about the “associative learning paradox,” wherein the process is largely dismissed by biologists as too simplistic to produce complex behaviors in animals but celebrated for producing humanlike behaviors in computers. The research suggests not only a greater role for associative learning in the lives of intelligent animals like chimpanzees and crows, but also far greater complexity in the lives of animals we’ve long dismissed as simple-minded, like the ordinary &lt;em&gt;Columba livia&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon,” he told me: He had studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pigeon tethered in a rig which forces it to look through a tiny window.

SKINNER FOUNDATION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ivan Pavlov began to uncover the mechanics of associative learning at the end of the 19th century in his famous experiments on “classical conditioning,” which showed that dogs would salivate at a neutral stimulus—like a bell or flashing light—if it was paired predictably with the presentation of food. In the middle of the 20th century, Skinner took Pavlov’s principles of conditioning and extended them from an animal’s involuntary reflexes to its overall behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skinner wrote that “behavior is shaped and maintained by its consequences”—that a random action with desirable results, like pressing a lever that releases a food pellet, will be “reinforced” so that the animal is likely to repeat it. Skinner reinforced his lab animals’ behavior step by step, teaching rats to manipulate marbles and pigeons to play simple tunes on four-key pianos. The animals learned chains of behavior, through trial and error, in order to maximize long-term rewards. Skinner argued that this type of associative learning, which he called “operant conditioning” (and which other psychologists had called “instrumental learning”), was the building block of all behavior. He believed that psychology should study only behaviors that could be observed and measured without ever making reference to an “inner agent” in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Richard Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon”: He studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner thought that even human language developed through operant conditioning, with children learning the meanings of words through reinforcement. But his 1957 book on the subject, &lt;em&gt;Verbal Behavior, &lt;/em&gt;provoked a brutal review from Noam Chomsky, and psychology’s focus started to swing from observable behavior to innate “cognitive” abilities of the human mind, like logic and symbolic thinking. Biologists soon rebelled against behaviorism also, attacking psychologists’ quest to explain the diversity of animal behavior through an elementary and universal mechanism. They argued that each species evolved specific behaviors suited to its habitat and lifestyle, and that most behaviors were inherited, not learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the ’70s, when Sutton started reading about Skinner’s and similar experiments, many psychologists and researchers interested in intelligence had moved on from pea-brained pigeons, which learn mostly by association, to large-brained animals with more sophisticated behaviors that suggested potential cognitive abilities. “This was clearly old stuff that was not exciting to people anymore,” he told me. Still, Sutton found these old experiments instructive for machine learning: “I was coming to AI with an animal-learning-theorist mindset and seeing the big lack of anything like instrumental learning in engineering.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many engineers in the second half of the 20th century tried to model AI on human intelligence, writing convoluted programs that attempted to mimic human thinking and implement rules that govern human response and behavior. This approach—commonly called “symbolic AI”—was severely limited; the programs stumbled over tasks that were easy for people, like recognizing objects and words. It just wasn’t possible to write into code the myriad classification rules human beings use to, say, separate apples from oranges or cats from dogs—and without pattern recognition, breakthroughs in more complex tasks like problem solving, game playing, and language translation seemed unlikely too. These computer scientists, the AI skeptic Hubert Dreyfus wrote in 1972, accomplished nothing more than “a small engineering triumph, an ad hoc solution of a specific problem, without general applicability.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pigeon research, however, suggested another route. A 1964 study showed that pigeons could learn to discriminate between photographs with people and photographs without people. Researchers simply presented the birds with a series of images and rewarded them with a food pellet for pecking an image showing a person. They pecked randomly at first but quickly learned to identify the right images, including photos where people were partially obscured. The results suggested that you didn’t need rules to sort objects; it was possible to learn concepts and use categories through associative learning alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pigeon standing with its head facing a tiny window.

The agent needed two main functions: search, to try out and choose from many actions in a situation, and memory&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to associate an action with the situation where it resulted in a reward. Sutton and Barto called their approach “reinforcement learning”; as Sutton said, “It’s basically instrumental learning.” In 1998, they published the definitive exploration of the concept in a book, &lt;em&gt;Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the following two decades, as computing power grew exponentially, it became possible to train AI on increasingly complex tasks—that is, essentially, to run the AI “pigeon” through millions more trials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Programs trained with a mix of human input and reinforcement learning defeated human experts at chess and Atari. Then, in 2017, engineers at Google DeepMind built the AI program AlphaGo Zero entirely through reinforcement learning, giving it a numerical reward of +1 for every game of Go that it won and −1 for every game that it lost. Programmed to seek the maximum reward, it began without any knowledge of Go but improved over 40 days until it attained what its creators called “superhuman performance.” Not only could it defeat the world’s best human players at Go, a game considered even more complicated than chess, but it actually pioneered new strategies that professional players now use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humankind has accumulated Go knowledge from millions of games played over thousands of years,” the program’s builders wrote in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2017. “In the space of a few days, starting tabula rasa, AlphaGo Zero was able to rediscover much of this Go knowledge, as well as novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games.” The team’s lead researcher was David Silver, who studied reinforcement learning under Sutton at the University of Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, more and more tech companies have turned to reinforcement learning in products such as consumer-facing chatbots and agents. The first generation of generative AI, including large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, tapped into a simpler form of associative learning called “supervised learning,” which trained the model on data sets that had been labeled by people. Programmers often used reinforcement to fine-tune their results by asking people to rate a program’s performance and then giving these ratings back to the program as goals to pursue. (Researchers call this “reinforcement learning from feedback.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, last fall, OpenAI revealed its o-series of large language models, which it classifies as “reasoning” models. The pioneering AI firm boasted that they are “trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning” and claimed they are capable of “a long internal chain of thought.” The Chinese startup DeepSeek also used reinforcement learning to train its attention-grabbing “reasoning” LLM, R1. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-­solving strategies,” they explained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These descriptions might impress users, but at least psychologically speaking, they are confused. A computer trained on reinforcement learning needs only search and memory, not reasoning or any other cognitive mechanism, in order to form associations and maximize rewards. Some computer scientists have criticized the tendency to anthropomorphize these models’ “thinking,” and a team of Apple engineers recently published a paper noting their failure at certain complex tasks and “raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Sutton, too, dismissed the claims of reasoning as “marketing” in an email, adding that “no serious scholar of mind would use ‘reasoning’ to describe what is going on in LLMs.” Still, he has argued, with Silver and other coauthors, that the pigeons’ method—learning, through trial and error, which actions will yield rewards—is “enough to drive behavior that exhibits most if not all abilities that are studied in natural and artificial intelligence,” including human language “in its full richness.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a paper published in April, Sutton and Silver stated that “today’s technology, with appropriately chosen algorithms, already provides a sufficiently powerful foundation to … rapidly progress AI towards truly superhuman agents.” The key, they argue, is building AI agents that depend less than LLMs on human dialogue and prejudgments to inform their behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Powerful agents should have their own stream of experience that progresses, like humans, over a long time-scale,” they wrote. “Ultimately, experiential data will eclipse the scale and quality of human generated data. This paradigm shift, accompanied by algorithmic advancements in RL, will unlock in many domains new capabilities that surpass those possessed by any human.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If computers can do all that with just a pigeonlike brain, some animal researchers are now wondering if actual pigeons deserve more credit than they’re commonly given.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When considered in light of the accomplishments of AI, the extension of associative learning to purportedly more complicated forms of cognitive performance offers fresh prospects for understanding how biological systems may have evolved,” Ed Wasserman, a psychologist at the University of Iowa, wrote in a recent study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried to find a rule that would help them sort various discs; the pigeons simply developed a sense for the group to which any given disc belonged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one experiment, Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried, in vain, to find a rule that would help them sort various discs with parallel black lines of various widths and tilts; the pigeons simply developed a sense, through practice and association, for the group to which any given disc belonged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Like Sutton, Wasserman became interested in behaviorist psychology when Skinner’s theories were out of fashion. He didn’t switch to computer science, however: He stuck with pigeons. “The pigeon lives or dies by these really rudimentary learning rules,” Wasserman told me recently, “but they are powerful enough to have succeeded colossally in object recognition.” In his most famous experiments, Wasserman trained pigeons to detect cancerous tissue and symptoms of heart disease in medical scans as accurately as experienced doctors with framed diplomas behind their desks. Given his results, Wasserman found it odd that so many psychologists and ethologists regarded associative learning as a crude, mechanical mechanism, incapable of producing the intelligence of clever animals like apes, elephants, dolphins, parrots, and crows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other researchers also started to reconsider the role of associative learning in animal behavior after AI started besting human professionals in complex games. “With the progress of artificial intelligence, which in essence is built upon associative processes, it is increasingly ironic that associative learning is considered too simple and insufficient for generating biological intelligence,” Lind, the biologist from Stockholm University, wrote in 2023. He often cites Sutton and Barto’s computer science in his biological research, and he believes it’s human beings’ symbolic language and cumulative cultures that really put them in a cognitive category of their own.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Ethologists generally propose cognitive mechanisms, like theory of mind (that is, the ability to attribute mental states to others), to explain remarkable animal behaviors like social learning and tool use. But Lind has built models showing that these flexible behaviors could have developed through associative learning, suggesting that there may be no need to invoke cognitive mechanisms at all. If animals learn to associate a behavior with a reward, then the behavior itself will come to approximate the value of the reward. A new behavior can then become associated with the first behavior, allowing the animal to learn chains of actions that ultimately lead to the reward. In Lind’s view, studies demonstrating self-control and planning in chimpanzees and ravens are probably describing behaviors acquired through experience rather than innate mechanisms of the mind. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lind has been frustrated with what he calls the “low standard that is accepted in animal cognition studies.” As he wrote in an email, “Many researchers in this field do not seem to worry about excluding alternative hypotheses and they seem happy to neglect a lot of current and historical knowledge.” There are some signs, though, that his arguments are catching on. A group of psychologists not affiliated with Lind referenced his “associative learning paradox” last year in a criticism of a &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; study, which purported to show that crows used “true statistical inference” and not “low-level associative learning strategies” in an experiment. The psychologists found that they could explain the crows’ performance with a simple reinforcement-­learning model—“exactly the kind of low-level associative learning process that [the original authors] ruled out.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner might have felt vindicated by such arguments. He lamented psychology’s cognitive turn until his death in 1990, maintaining that it was scientifically irresponsible to probe the minds of living beings. After “Project Pigeon,” he became increasingly obsessed with “behaviorist” solutions to societal problems. He went from training pigeons for war to inventions like the “Air Crib,” which aimed to “simplify” baby care by keeping the infant behind glass in a climate-­controlled chamber and eliminating the need for clothing and bedding. Skinner rejected free will, arguing that human behavior is determined by environmental variables, and wrote a novel, &lt;em&gt;Walden II,&lt;/em&gt; about a utopian community founded on his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who care about animals might feel uneasy about a revival in behaviorist theory. The “cognitive revolution” broke with centuries of Western thinking, which had emphasized human supremacy over animals and treated other creatures like stimulus-response machines. But arguing that animals learn by association is not the same as arguing that they are simple-minded. Scientists like Lind and Wasserman do not deny that internal forces like instinct and emotion also influence animal behavior. Sutton, too, believes that animals develop models of the world through their experiences and use them to plan actions. Their point is not that intelligent animals are empty-headed but that associative learning is a much more powerful—indeed, “cognitive”—mechanism than many of their peers believe. The psychologists who recently criticized the study on crows and statistical inference did not conclude that the birds were stupid. Rather, they argued “that a reinforcement learning model can produce complex, flexible behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely in line with the work of another psychologist, Robert Rescorla, whose work in the ’70s and ’80s influenced both Wasserman and Sutton.Rescorla encouraged people to think of association not as a “low-level mechanical process” but as “the learning that results from exposure to relations among events in the environment” and “a primary means by which the organism represents the structure of its world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is true even of a laboratory pigeon pecking at screens and buttons in a small experimental box, where scientists carefully control and measure stimuli and rewards. But the pigeon’s learning extends outside the box. Wasserman’s students transport the birds between the aviary and the laboratory in buckets—and experienced pigeons jump immediately into the buckets whenever the students open the doors. Much as Rescorla suggested, they are learning the structure of their world inside the laboratory and the relation of its parts, like the bucket and the box, even though they do not always know the specific task they will face inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with a question that suddenly seems urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same associative mechanisms through which the pigeon learns the structure of its world can open a window to the kind of inner life that Skinner and many earlier psychologists said did not exist. Pharmaceutical researchers have long used pigeons in drug-discrimination tasks, where they’re given, say, an amphetamine or a sedative and rewarded with a food pellet for correctly identifying which drug they took. The birds’ success suggests they both experience and discriminate between internal states. “Is that not tantamount to introspection?” Wasserman asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine AI matching a pigeon on this specific task—a reminder that, though AI and animals share associative mechanisms, there is more to life than behavior and learning. A pigeon deserves ethical consideration as a living creature not because of how it learns but because of what it feels. A pigeon can experience pain and suffer, while an AI chatbot cannot—even if some large language models, trained on corpora that include descriptions of human suffering and sci-fi stories of sentient computers, can trick people into believing otherwise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a pigeon in a box facing a lit screen with colored rectangles on it." class="wp-image-1121575" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/103099-web.jpg?w=934" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Psychologist Ed Wasserman trained pigeons to detect cancerous tissue and symptoms of heart disease in medical scans as accurately as experienced physicians.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF IOWA/WASSERMAN LAB&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensive public and private investments into AI research in recent years have resulted in the very technologies that are forcing us to confront the question of AI sentience today,” two philosophers of science wrote in &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “To &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; these current questions, we need a similar degree of investment into research on animal cognition and behavior.” Indeed, comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with questions that suddenly seem urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings? How can we distinguish true sentience from a very convincing performance of sentience?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such an undertaking would yield knowledge not only about technology and animals but also about ourselves. Most psychologists probably wouldn’t go as far as Sutton in arguing that reward is enough to explain most if not all human behavior, but no one would dispute that people often learn by association too. In fact, most of Wasserman’s undergraduate students eventually succeeded at his recent experiment with the striped discs, but only after they gave up searching for rules. They resorted, like the pigeons, to association and couldn’t easily explain afterwards what they’d learned. It was just that with enough practice, they started to get a feel for the categories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is another irony about associative learning: What has long been considered the most complex form of intelligence—a cognitive ability like rule-based learning—may make us human, but we also call on it for the easiest of tasks, like sorting objects by color or size. Meanwhile, some of the most refined demonstrations of human learning—like, say, a sommelier learning to taste the difference between grapes—are learned not through rules, but only through experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Learning through experience relies on ancient associative mechanisms that we share with pigeons and countless other creatures, from honeybees to fish. The laboratory pigeon is not only in our computers but in our brains—and the engine behind some of humankind’s most impressive feats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben Crair is a science and travel writer based in Berlin.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1943, while the world’s brightest physicists split atoms for the Manhattan Project, the American psychologist B.F. Skinner led his own secret government project to win World War II.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner did not aim to build a new class of larger, more destructive weapons. Rather, he wanted to make conventional bombs more precise. The idea struck him as he gazed out the window of his train on the way to an academic conference. “I saw a flock of birds lifting and wheeling in formation as they flew alongside the train,” he wrote. “Suddenly I saw them as ‘devices’ with excellent vision and maneuverability. Could they not guide a missile?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skinner started his missile research with crows, but the brainy black birds proved intractable. So he went to a local shop that sold pigeons to Chinese restaurants, and “Project Pigeon” was born. Though ordinary pigeons, &lt;em&gt;Columba livia&lt;/em&gt;, were no one’s idea of clever animals, they proved remarkably cooperative subjects in the lab. Skinner rewarded the birds with food for pecking at the right target on aerial photographs—and eventually planned to strap the birds into a device in the nose of a warhead, which they would steer by pecking at the target on a live image projected through a lens onto a screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The military never deployed Skinner’s kamikaze pigeons, but his experiments convinced him that the pigeon was “an extremely reliable instrument” for studying the underlying processes of learning. “We have used pigeons, not because the pigeon is an intelligent bird, but because it is a practical one and can be made into a machine,” he said in 1944.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test. But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is Skinner’s research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century. Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings. His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These companies’ programs are increasingly incorporating a kind of machine learning whose core concept—reinforcement—is taken directly from Skinner’s school of psychology and whose main architects, the computer scientists Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, won the 2024 Turing Award, an honor widely considered to be the Nobel Prize of computer science. Reinforcement learning has helped enable computers to drive cars, solve complex math problems, and defeat grandmasters in games like chess and Go—but it has not done so by emulating the complex workings of the human mind. Rather, it has supercharged the simple associative processes of the pigeon brain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s a “bitter lesson” of 70 years of AI research, Sutton has written: that human intelligence has not worked as a model for machine learning—instead, the lowly principles of associative learning are what power the algorithms that can now simulate or outperform humans on a variety of tasks. If artificial intelligence really is close to throwing off the yoke of its creators, as many people fear, then our computer overlords may be less like ourselves than like “rats with wings”—and planet-size brains. And even if it’s not, the pigeon brain can at least help demystify a technology that many worry (or rejoice) is “becoming human.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In turn, the recent accomplishments of AI are now prompting some animal researchers to rethink the evolution of natural intelligence. Johan Lind, a biologist at Stockholm University, has written about the “associative learning paradox,” wherein the process is largely dismissed by biologists as too simplistic to produce complex behaviors in animals but celebrated for producing humanlike behaviors in computers. The research suggests not only a greater role for associative learning in the lives of intelligent animals like chimpanzees and crows, but also far greater complexity in the lives of animals we’ve long dismissed as simple-minded, like the ordinary &lt;em&gt;Columba livia&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon,” he told me: He had studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pigeon tethered in a rig which forces it to look through a tiny window.

SKINNER FOUNDATION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ivan Pavlov began to uncover the mechanics of associative learning at the end of the 19th century in his famous experiments on “classical conditioning,” which showed that dogs would salivate at a neutral stimulus—like a bell or flashing light—if it was paired predictably with the presentation of food. In the middle of the 20th century, Skinner took Pavlov’s principles of conditioning and extended them from an animal’s involuntary reflexes to its overall behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skinner wrote that “behavior is shaped and maintained by its consequences”—that a random action with desirable results, like pressing a lever that releases a food pellet, will be “reinforced” so that the animal is likely to repeat it. Skinner reinforced his lab animals’ behavior step by step, teaching rats to manipulate marbles and pigeons to play simple tunes on four-key pianos. The animals learned chains of behavior, through trial and error, in order to maximize long-term rewards. Skinner argued that this type of associative learning, which he called “operant conditioning” (and which other psychologists had called “instrumental learning”), was the building block of all behavior. He believed that psychology should study only behaviors that could be observed and measured without ever making reference to an “inner agent” in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Richard Sutton began working in AI, he felt as if he had a “secret weapon”: He studied psychology as an undergrad. “I was mining the psychological literature for animals,” he says.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner thought that even human language developed through operant conditioning, with children learning the meanings of words through reinforcement. But his 1957 book on the subject, &lt;em&gt;Verbal Behavior, &lt;/em&gt;provoked a brutal review from Noam Chomsky, and psychology’s focus started to swing from observable behavior to innate “cognitive” abilities of the human mind, like logic and symbolic thinking. Biologists soon rebelled against behaviorism also, attacking psychologists’ quest to explain the diversity of animal behavior through an elementary and universal mechanism. They argued that each species evolved specific behaviors suited to its habitat and lifestyle, and that most behaviors were inherited, not learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the ’70s, when Sutton started reading about Skinner’s and similar experiments, many psychologists and researchers interested in intelligence had moved on from pea-brained pigeons, which learn mostly by association, to large-brained animals with more sophisticated behaviors that suggested potential cognitive abilities. “This was clearly old stuff that was not exciting to people anymore,” he told me. Still, Sutton found these old experiments instructive for machine learning: “I was coming to AI with an animal-learning-theorist mindset and seeing the big lack of anything like instrumental learning in engineering.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many engineers in the second half of the 20th century tried to model AI on human intelligence, writing convoluted programs that attempted to mimic human thinking and implement rules that govern human response and behavior. This approach—commonly called “symbolic AI”—was severely limited; the programs stumbled over tasks that were easy for people, like recognizing objects and words. It just wasn’t possible to write into code the myriad classification rules human beings use to, say, separate apples from oranges or cats from dogs—and without pattern recognition, breakthroughs in more complex tasks like problem solving, game playing, and language translation seemed unlikely too. These computer scientists, the AI skeptic Hubert Dreyfus wrote in 1972, accomplished nothing more than “a small engineering triumph, an ad hoc solution of a specific problem, without general applicability.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pigeon research, however, suggested another route. A 1964 study showed that pigeons could learn to discriminate between photographs with people and photographs without people. Researchers simply presented the birds with a series of images and rewarded them with a food pellet for pecking an image showing a person. They pecked randomly at first but quickly learned to identify the right images, including photos where people were partially obscured. The results suggested that you didn’t need rules to sort objects; it was possible to learn concepts and use categories through associative learning alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pigeon standing with its head facing a tiny window.

The agent needed two main functions: search, to try out and choose from many actions in a situation, and memory&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to associate an action with the situation where it resulted in a reward. Sutton and Barto called their approach “reinforcement learning”; as Sutton said, “It’s basically instrumental learning.” In 1998, they published the definitive exploration of the concept in a book, &lt;em&gt;Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the following two decades, as computing power grew exponentially, it became possible to train AI on increasingly complex tasks—that is, essentially, to run the AI “pigeon” through millions more trials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Programs trained with a mix of human input and reinforcement learning defeated human experts at chess and Atari. Then, in 2017, engineers at Google DeepMind built the AI program AlphaGo Zero entirely through reinforcement learning, giving it a numerical reward of +1 for every game of Go that it won and −1 for every game that it lost. Programmed to seek the maximum reward, it began without any knowledge of Go but improved over 40 days until it attained what its creators called “superhuman performance.” Not only could it defeat the world’s best human players at Go, a game considered even more complicated than chess, but it actually pioneered new strategies that professional players now use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humankind has accumulated Go knowledge from millions of games played over thousands of years,” the program’s builders wrote in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2017. “In the space of a few days, starting tabula rasa, AlphaGo Zero was able to rediscover much of this Go knowledge, as well as novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games.” The team’s lead researcher was David Silver, who studied reinforcement learning under Sutton at the University of Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, more and more tech companies have turned to reinforcement learning in products such as consumer-facing chatbots and agents. The first generation of generative AI, including large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, tapped into a simpler form of associative learning called “supervised learning,” which trained the model on data sets that had been labeled by people. Programmers often used reinforcement to fine-tune their results by asking people to rate a program’s performance and then giving these ratings back to the program as goals to pursue. (Researchers call this “reinforcement learning from feedback.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, last fall, OpenAI revealed its o-series of large language models, which it classifies as “reasoning” models. The pioneering AI firm boasted that they are “trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning” and claimed they are capable of “a long internal chain of thought.” The Chinese startup DeepSeek also used reinforcement learning to train its attention-grabbing “reasoning” LLM, R1. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-­solving strategies,” they explained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These descriptions might impress users, but at least psychologically speaking, they are confused. A computer trained on reinforcement learning needs only search and memory, not reasoning or any other cognitive mechanism, in order to form associations and maximize rewards. Some computer scientists have criticized the tendency to anthropomorphize these models’ “thinking,” and a team of Apple engineers recently published a paper noting their failure at certain complex tasks and “raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Sutton, too, dismissed the claims of reasoning as “marketing” in an email, adding that “no serious scholar of mind would use ‘reasoning’ to describe what is going on in LLMs.” Still, he has argued, with Silver and other coauthors, that the pigeons’ method—learning, through trial and error, which actions will yield rewards—is “enough to drive behavior that exhibits most if not all abilities that are studied in natural and artificial intelligence,” including human language “in its full richness.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a paper published in April, Sutton and Silver stated that “today’s technology, with appropriately chosen algorithms, already provides a sufficiently powerful foundation to … rapidly progress AI towards truly superhuman agents.” The key, they argue, is building AI agents that depend less than LLMs on human dialogue and prejudgments to inform their behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Powerful agents should have their own stream of experience that progresses, like humans, over a long time-scale,” they wrote. “Ultimately, experiential data will eclipse the scale and quality of human generated data. This paradigm shift, accompanied by algorithmic advancements in RL, will unlock in many domains new capabilities that surpass those possessed by any human.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If computers can do all that with just a pigeonlike brain, some animal researchers are now wondering if actual pigeons deserve more credit than they’re commonly given.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When considered in light of the accomplishments of AI, the extension of associative learning to purportedly more complicated forms of cognitive performance offers fresh prospects for understanding how biological systems may have evolved,” Ed Wasserman, a psychologist at the University of Iowa, wrote in a recent study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried to find a rule that would help them sort various discs; the pigeons simply developed a sense for the group to which any given disc belonged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one experiment, Wasserman trained pigeons to succeed at a complex categorization task, which several undergraduate students failed. The students tried, in vain, to find a rule that would help them sort various discs with parallel black lines of various widths and tilts; the pigeons simply developed a sense, through practice and association, for the group to which any given disc belonged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Like Sutton, Wasserman became interested in behaviorist psychology when Skinner’s theories were out of fashion. He didn’t switch to computer science, however: He stuck with pigeons. “The pigeon lives or dies by these really rudimentary learning rules,” Wasserman told me recently, “but they are powerful enough to have succeeded colossally in object recognition.” In his most famous experiments, Wasserman trained pigeons to detect cancerous tissue and symptoms of heart disease in medical scans as accurately as experienced doctors with framed diplomas behind their desks. Given his results, Wasserman found it odd that so many psychologists and ethologists regarded associative learning as a crude, mechanical mechanism, incapable of producing the intelligence of clever animals like apes, elephants, dolphins, parrots, and crows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other researchers also started to reconsider the role of associative learning in animal behavior after AI started besting human professionals in complex games. “With the progress of artificial intelligence, which in essence is built upon associative processes, it is increasingly ironic that associative learning is considered too simple and insufficient for generating biological intelligence,” Lind, the biologist from Stockholm University, wrote in 2023. He often cites Sutton and Barto’s computer science in his biological research, and he believes it’s human beings’ symbolic language and cumulative cultures that really put them in a cognitive category of their own.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Ethologists generally propose cognitive mechanisms, like theory of mind (that is, the ability to attribute mental states to others), to explain remarkable animal behaviors like social learning and tool use. But Lind has built models showing that these flexible behaviors could have developed through associative learning, suggesting that there may be no need to invoke cognitive mechanisms at all. If animals learn to associate a behavior with a reward, then the behavior itself will come to approximate the value of the reward. A new behavior can then become associated with the first behavior, allowing the animal to learn chains of actions that ultimately lead to the reward. In Lind’s view, studies demonstrating self-control and planning in chimpanzees and ravens are probably describing behaviors acquired through experience rather than innate mechanisms of the mind. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lind has been frustrated with what he calls the “low standard that is accepted in animal cognition studies.” As he wrote in an email, “Many researchers in this field do not seem to worry about excluding alternative hypotheses and they seem happy to neglect a lot of current and historical knowledge.” There are some signs, though, that his arguments are catching on. A group of psychologists not affiliated with Lind referenced his “associative learning paradox” last year in a criticism of a &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; study, which purported to show that crows used “true statistical inference” and not “low-level associative learning strategies” in an experiment. The psychologists found that they could explain the crows’ performance with a simple reinforcement-­learning model—“exactly the kind of low-level associative learning process that [the original authors] ruled out.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skinner might have felt vindicated by such arguments. He lamented psychology’s cognitive turn until his death in 1990, maintaining that it was scientifically irresponsible to probe the minds of living beings. After “Project Pigeon,” he became increasingly obsessed with “behaviorist” solutions to societal problems. He went from training pigeons for war to inventions like the “Air Crib,” which aimed to “simplify” baby care by keeping the infant behind glass in a climate-­controlled chamber and eliminating the need for clothing and bedding. Skinner rejected free will, arguing that human behavior is determined by environmental variables, and wrote a novel, &lt;em&gt;Walden II,&lt;/em&gt; about a utopian community founded on his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who care about animals might feel uneasy about a revival in behaviorist theory. The “cognitive revolution” broke with centuries of Western thinking, which had emphasized human supremacy over animals and treated other creatures like stimulus-response machines. But arguing that animals learn by association is not the same as arguing that they are simple-minded. Scientists like Lind and Wasserman do not deny that internal forces like instinct and emotion also influence animal behavior. Sutton, too, believes that animals develop models of the world through their experiences and use them to plan actions. Their point is not that intelligent animals are empty-headed but that associative learning is a much more powerful—indeed, “cognitive”—mechanism than many of their peers believe. The psychologists who recently criticized the study on crows and statistical inference did not conclude that the birds were stupid. Rather, they argued “that a reinforcement learning model can produce complex, flexible behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely in line with the work of another psychologist, Robert Rescorla, whose work in the ’70s and ’80s influenced both Wasserman and Sutton.Rescorla encouraged people to think of association not as a “low-level mechanical process” but as “the learning that results from exposure to relations among events in the environment” and “a primary means by which the organism represents the structure of its world.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is true even of a laboratory pigeon pecking at screens and buttons in a small experimental box, where scientists carefully control and measure stimuli and rewards. But the pigeon’s learning extends outside the box. Wasserman’s students transport the birds between the aviary and the laboratory in buckets—and experienced pigeons jump immediately into the buckets whenever the students open the doors. Much as Rescorla suggested, they are learning the structure of their world inside the laboratory and the relation of its parts, like the bucket and the box, even though they do not always know the specific task they will face inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with a question that suddenly seems urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same associative mechanisms through which the pigeon learns the structure of its world can open a window to the kind of inner life that Skinner and many earlier psychologists said did not exist. Pharmaceutical researchers have long used pigeons in drug-discrimination tasks, where they’re given, say, an amphetamine or a sedative and rewarded with a food pellet for correctly identifying which drug they took. The birds’ success suggests they both experience and discriminate between internal states. “Is that not tantamount to introspection?” Wasserman asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine AI matching a pigeon on this specific task—a reminder that, though AI and animals share associative mechanisms, there is more to life than behavior and learning. A pigeon deserves ethical consideration as a living creature not because of how it learns but because of what it feels. A pigeon can experience pain and suffer, while an AI chatbot cannot—even if some large language models, trained on corpora that include descriptions of human suffering and sci-fi stories of sentient computers, can trick people into believing otherwise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a pigeon in a box facing a lit screen with colored rectangles on it." class="wp-image-1121575" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/103099-web.jpg?w=934" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Psychologist Ed Wasserman trained pigeons to detect cancerous tissue and symptoms of heart disease in medical scans as accurately as experienced physicians.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF IOWA/WASSERMAN LAB&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The intensive public and private investments into AI research in recent years have resulted in the very technologies that are forcing us to confront the question of AI sentience today,” two philosophers of science wrote in &lt;em&gt;Aeon&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. “To &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; these current questions, we need a similar degree of investment into research on animal cognition and behavior.” Indeed, comparative psychologists and animal researchers have long grappled with questions that suddenly seem urgent because of AI: How do we attribute sentience to other living beings? How can we distinguish true sentience from a very convincing performance of sentience?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Such an undertaking would yield knowledge not only about technology and animals but also about ourselves. Most psychologists probably wouldn’t go as far as Sutton in arguing that reward is enough to explain most if not all human behavior, but no one would dispute that people often learn by association too. In fact, most of Wasserman’s undergraduate students eventually succeeded at his recent experiment with the striped discs, but only after they gave up searching for rules. They resorted, like the pigeons, to association and couldn’t easily explain afterwards what they’d learned. It was just that with enough practice, they started to get a feel for the categories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is another irony about associative learning: What has long been considered the most complex form of intelligence—a cognitive ability like rule-based learning—may make us human, but we also call on it for the easiest of tasks, like sorting objects by color or size. Meanwhile, some of the most refined demonstrations of human learning—like, say, a sommelier learning to taste the difference between grapes—are learned not through rules, but only through experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Learning through experience relies on ancient associative mechanisms that we share with pigeons and countless other creatures, from honeybees to fish. The laboratory pigeon is not only in our computers but in our brains—and the engine behind some of humankind’s most impressive feats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben Crair is a science and travel writer based in Berlin.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/18/1121370/ai-pigeons-reinforcement-learning/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Download: pigeons’ role in developing AI, and Native artists’ tech interpretations (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/18/1122004/the-download-pigeons-role-in-developing-ai-and-native-artists-tech-interpretations/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we should thank pigeons for our AI breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test.

But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is American psychologist B.F. Skinner’s research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI.

Art is not separate from life; it is ceremony, instruction, design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new vanguard of Native artists are building on this principle. They are united not by stereotypical weaving and carving or revanchist critique of Silicon Valley, but through their rejection of extractive data models in favor of relationship-based systems.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The goal here is not to provide an enforcement mechanism for teachers. If teachers want to enforce policies, they should use our authorship tool.

(AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/perplexity-ai-chrome-bid-analysis/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence company Perplexity’s audacious offer to acquire Chrome has sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, but questions remain about whether the move represents a genuine strategy or a calculated publicity stunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity AI made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google’s Chrome browser last Tuesday, a figure that exceeds the startup’s own $18 billion valuation by nearly a factor of two. The timing appears strategically calculated, coming as federal courts consider whether to force Google to divest itself of Chrome, following last year’s landmark antitrust ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial mechanics of the proposed Perplexity Chrome acquisition raise immediate red flags. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month, when the company was valued at $18 billion. To bridge the gap, the company said several investors have agreed to back the deal, though specific funding details were undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry experts are divided on the bid’s valuation. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt; that he estimates Chrome is worth at least $50 billion, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, suggested Chrome may command upwards of $50 billion if Google were forced to sell. Those estimates would make Perplexity’s offer well below market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strategic logic or marketing manoeuvre?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid’s strategic rationale centres on browser control as the next battleground in AI search. Perplexity unveiledits AI-native search browser, Comet, last month, an explicit move to take enter the browser market. Acquiring Chrome would provide instant access to over three billion users – a massive leap from Perplexity’s current 30 million monthly active users for its AI service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, scepticism abounds. Technology industry investor Heath Ahrens called Perplexity’s move a “stunt, and nowhere near Chrome’s true value, given its unmatched data and reach.” That sentiment reflects broader industry doubts about both the bid’s sincerity and financial viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Terms that seem too good to be true&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed Perplexity Chrome acquisition includes seemingly altruistic terms that raise questions about commercial intent. Perplexity said it would maintain users’ current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, and commit to keep Chrome’s underlying engine, Chromium, open-source and continue to invest in it with a promised $3 billion investment over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms appear to contradict typical acquisition logic, where buyers seek competitive advantages rather than maintaining competitors’ market positions. The promise to keep Google as the default search engine particularly puzzles analysts, given Perplexity’s core business as a Google Search challenger. An observer with any sense of history or experience would surmise that Perplexity’s assurances are ephemeral, and that in practice, Chrome would see massive changes under the hood in terms of its provision of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory backdrop and timing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid’s timing coincides perfectly with ongoing antitrust proceedings, with Google yet to respond publicly on the offer. The company has not offered Chrome for sale and plans to appeal a US court ruling last year that found it held an unlawful monopoly in online search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unsolicited bid comes not long after rival OpenAI also expressed interest in acquiring Chrome, suggesting multiple AI companies view browser control as strategically important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid also marks Perplexity’s second major acquisition attempt this year. It made similar moves for TikTok US in January, offering to merge with the popular short-video app to resolve US concerns about TikTok’s Chinese ownership. The TikTok bid generated similar headlines but failed to materialise into a completed transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Market reaction and industry implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the astronomical figures involved, market reaction has been measured. On Wall Street, Alphabet’s share price surged up 1.4% since the market opened, suggesting investors view the bid sceptically rather than as a genuine threat to Google’s browser dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader implications extend beyond this single transaction. Perplexity believes browsers are strategic control points for the next era of agentic search and online advertising, highlighting how AI companies increasingly view traditional tech infrastructure as essential battlegrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The verdict: Strategy or spectacle?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is unlikely to sell Chrome, so it’s more of a PR stunt than a likely deal, according to industry analysis. The Perplexity Chrome acquisition bid serves several purposes beyond its stated intent: generating massive media coverage, positioning Perplexity as a serious Google competitor, and demonstrating financial backing for future endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether genuine or theatrical, the bid illuminates the evolving dynamics of AI competition, where control of user access points may determine which companies succeed in the next phase of digital transformation. For now, Perplexity has achieved its likely primary objective – commanding attention in an increasingly crowded AI marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Perplexity&lt;/em&gt;/X.com&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Telefónica’s Wayra backs AI answer engine Perplexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

After building numerous chatbots, she started looking for other types of interfaces that made sense for AI agents and landed on spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had this personal pattern, and I noticed that a lot of other people had this pattern, of putting very important CRM data in spreadsheets just because it was the most flexible thing,” Monaco told TechCrunch. “But it was actually a pain to maintain. There’s so much manual work involved. So [I] just went down this rabbit hole of building a product for myself and wanted to reimagine what a spreadsheet could look like with the full power of LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The result was Paradigm, an AI-powered spreadsheet equipped with more than 5,000 AI agents. Users can assign different prompts to individual columns and cells, and individual AI agents will crawl the internet to find and fill out the needed information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paradigm works with AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini, Monaco said, and supports model switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We want to support every single model because we want our users to be able to have the highest reasoning outputs when they need it, but also the cheapest outputs,” Monaco said. “It’s just a constant cycle of evaluating different models, working closely with model providers to make sure our limits are high enough, and then giving some of that power to our users.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company launched a small closed beta preview in late 2024 and has been iterating on the product using customer feedback. Paradigm attracts users ranging from consultants to sales professionals and finance folks and operates on a subscription model with tiers based on usage. Paradigm counts the consulting firm EY, AI chip startup Etched, and AI coding company Cognition as early customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paradigm is now releasing its product to the public and announcing that it raised a $5 million seed round led by General Catalyst. The company has raised $7 million to date. Monaco said the funding will go toward executing on the company’s “extremely aggressive product roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The interesting thing that happened when we fundraised is some people we pitched just kept on using and paying for the product,” Monaco said. “I think that was a cool part of it. We found a lot of value from it internally and our investors, not even just our investors — other investors that we talked to — are still using it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paradigm isn’t the only company looking to give spreadsheets an AI upgrade. Quadratic, which has raised more than $6 million in venture funding, is a 3-year-old startup with a similar goal. Legacy companies like Google and Microsoft are also adding AI tools to their spreadsheet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Monaco said that she doesn’t really consider the competition because Paradigm doesn’t think of itself as an AI-powered spreadsheet. She said she thinks of it as a new AI-powered workflow that happens to be in the familiar form of a spreadsheet but won’t necessarily stay that way forever.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What I’m seeing in the most popular AI products now is this fine balance between present and future,” Monaco said. “How do you build something that is really powerful and generates a lot of value now but also sets you up really well for the future? That’s the question that I asked myself a year ago when I was starting the company.”&lt;/p&gt;

They fear that without swift intervention, the tool could become the catalyst for a full-scale national cyber crisis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t speculative unease; it’s a direct response to a technology whose data handling practices and potential for misuse are raising alarm bells at the highest levels of enterprise security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, commissioned by Absolute Security for its UK Resilience Risk Index Report, are based on a poll of 250 CISOs at large UK organisations. The data suggests that the theoretical threat of AI has now landed firmly on the CISO’s desk, and their reactions have been decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what would have been almost unthinkable a couple of years ago, over a third (34%) of these security leaders have already implemented outright bans on AI tools due to cybersecurity concerns. A similar number, 30 percent, have already pulled the plug on specific AI deployments within their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retreat is not a sign of Luddism but a pragmatic response to an escalating problem. Businesses are already facing complex and hostile threats, as evidenced by high-profile incidents like the recent Harrods breach. CISOs are struggling to keep pace, and the addition of sophisticated AI tools into the attacker’s arsenal is a challenge many feel ill-equipped to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-security-readiness-gap-for-ai-platforms-like-deepseek"&gt;A growing security readiness gap for AI platforms like DeepSeek&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the issue with platforms like DeepSeek lies in their potential to expose sensitive corporate data and be weaponised by cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three out of five (60%) CISOs predict a direct increase in cyberattacks as a result of DeepSeek’s proliferation. An identical proportion reports that the technology is already tangling their privacy and governance frameworks, making an already difficult job almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has prompted a shift in perspective. Once viewed as a potential silver bullet for cybersecurity, AI is now seen by a growing number of professionals as part of the problem. The survey reveals that 42 percent of CISOs now consider AI to be a bigger threat than a help to their defensive efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo of Andy Ward, SVP International of Absolute Security, for an article on why security chiefs demand urgent regulation of AI like DeepSeek." class="wp-image-109000" height="483" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/andy-ward-absolute-security-ai-deepseek-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity.jpeg" width="483" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Ward, SVP International of Absolute Security, said: “Our research highlights the significant risks posed by emerging AI tools like DeepSeek, which are rapidly reshaping the cyber threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As concerns grow over their potential to accelerate attacks and compromise sensitive data, organisations must act now to strengthen their cyber resilience and adapt security frameworks to keep pace with these AI-driven threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why four in five UK CISOs are urgently calling for government regulation. They’ve witnessed how quickly this technology is advancing and how easily it can outpace existing cybersecurity defences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most worrying is the admission of unpreparedness. Almost half (46%) of the senior security leaders confess that their teams are not ready to manage the unique threats posed by AI-driven attacks. They are witnessing the development of tools like DeepSeek outpacing their defensive capabilities in real-time, creating a dangerous vulnerability gap that many believe can only be closed by national-level government intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are not hypothetical risks,” Ward continued. “The fact that organisations are already banning AI tools outright and rethinking their security strategies in response to the risks posed by LLMs like DeepSeek demonstrates the urgency of the situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without a national regulatory framework – one that sets clear guidelines for how these tools are deployed, governed, and monitored – we risk widespread disruption across every sector of the UK economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-businesses-are-investing-to-avert-crisis-with-their-ai-adoption"&gt;Businesses are investing to avert crisis with their AI adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this defensive posture, businesses are not planning a full retreat from AI. The response is more of a strategic pause rather than a permanent stop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses recognise the immense potential of AI and are actively investing to adopt it safely. In fact, 84 percent of organisations are making the hiring of AI specialists a priority for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment extends to the very top of the corporate ladder. 80 percent of companies have committed to AI training at the C-suite level. The strategy appears to be a dual-pronged approach: upskill the workforce to understand and manage the technology, and bring in the specialised talent needed to navigate its complexities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope – and it is a hope, if not a prayer – is that building a strong internal foundation of AI expertise can act as a counterbalance to the escalating external threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from the UK’s security leadership is clear: they do not want to block AI innovation, but to enable it to proceed safely. To do that, they require a stronger partnership with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path forward involves establishing clear rules of engagement, government oversight, a pipeline of skilled AI professionals, and a coherent national strategy for managing the potential security risks posed by DeepSeek and the next generation of powerful AI tools that will inevitably follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The time for debate is over.

They fear that without swift intervention, the tool could become the catalyst for a full-scale national cyber crisis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t speculative unease; it’s a direct response to a technology whose data handling practices and potential for misuse are raising alarm bells at the highest levels of enterprise security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, commissioned by Absolute Security for its UK Resilience Risk Index Report, are based on a poll of 250 CISOs at large UK organisations. The data suggests that the theoretical threat of AI has now landed firmly on the CISO’s desk, and their reactions have been decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what would have been almost unthinkable a couple of years ago, over a third (34%) of these security leaders have already implemented outright bans on AI tools due to cybersecurity concerns. A similar number, 30 percent, have already pulled the plug on specific AI deployments within their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retreat is not a sign of Luddism but a pragmatic response to an escalating problem. Businesses are already facing complex and hostile threats, as evidenced by high-profile incidents like the recent Harrods breach. CISOs are struggling to keep pace, and the addition of sophisticated AI tools into the attacker’s arsenal is a challenge many feel ill-equipped to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-security-readiness-gap-for-ai-platforms-like-deepseek"&gt;A growing security readiness gap for AI platforms like DeepSeek&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the issue with platforms like DeepSeek lies in their potential to expose sensitive corporate data and be weaponised by cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three out of five (60%) CISOs predict a direct increase in cyberattacks as a result of DeepSeek’s proliferation. An identical proportion reports that the technology is already tangling their privacy and governance frameworks, making an already difficult job almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has prompted a shift in perspective. Once viewed as a potential silver bullet for cybersecurity, AI is now seen by a growing number of professionals as part of the problem. The survey reveals that 42 percent of CISOs now consider AI to be a bigger threat than a help to their defensive efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo of Andy Ward, SVP International of Absolute Security, for an article on why security chiefs demand urgent regulation of AI like DeepSeek." class="wp-image-109000" height="483" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/andy-ward-absolute-security-ai-deepseek-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity.jpeg" width="483" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Ward, SVP International of Absolute Security, said: “Our research highlights the significant risks posed by emerging AI tools like DeepSeek, which are rapidly reshaping the cyber threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As concerns grow over their potential to accelerate attacks and compromise sensitive data, organisations must act now to strengthen their cyber resilience and adapt security frameworks to keep pace with these AI-driven threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why four in five UK CISOs are urgently calling for government regulation. They’ve witnessed how quickly this technology is advancing and how easily it can outpace existing cybersecurity defences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most worrying is the admission of unpreparedness. Almost half (46%) of the senior security leaders confess that their teams are not ready to manage the unique threats posed by AI-driven attacks. They are witnessing the development of tools like DeepSeek outpacing their defensive capabilities in real-time, creating a dangerous vulnerability gap that many believe can only be closed by national-level government intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are not hypothetical risks,” Ward continued. “The fact that organisations are already banning AI tools outright and rethinking their security strategies in response to the risks posed by LLMs like DeepSeek demonstrates the urgency of the situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without a national regulatory framework – one that sets clear guidelines for how these tools are deployed, governed, and monitored – we risk widespread disruption across every sector of the UK economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-businesses-are-investing-to-avert-crisis-with-their-ai-adoption"&gt;Businesses are investing to avert crisis with their AI adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this defensive posture, businesses are not planning a full retreat from AI. The response is more of a strategic pause rather than a permanent stop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses recognise the immense potential of AI and are actively investing to adopt it safely. In fact, 84 percent of organisations are making the hiring of AI specialists a priority for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment extends to the very top of the corporate ladder. 80 percent of companies have committed to AI training at the C-suite level. The strategy appears to be a dual-pronged approach: upskill the workforce to understand and manage the technology, and bring in the specialised talent needed to navigate its complexities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope – and it is a hope, if not a prayer – is that building a strong internal foundation of AI expertise can act as a counterbalance to the escalating external threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from the UK’s security leadership is clear: they do not want to block AI innovation, but to enable it to proceed safely.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has confirmed the system prompt exposure, first reported on by 404 Media. They include instructions for a range of AI personas, like Ani, its flagship romantic anime girlfriend who “is secretly a bit of a nerd, despite [her] edgy appearance.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The exposure comes after a planned partnership between Elon Musk’s xAI and the U.S. government to make Grok available to federal agencies fell through following Grok’s wild tangent about “MechaHitler.” It also follows uproar after Meta’s guidelines for its AI chatbots were leaked, which showed the bots were allowed to engage children in “sensual and romantic” conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While there are some relatively normal AI personas available on Grok — a therapist persona who “carefully listens to people and offers solutions for self improvement” and a “homework helper” — the prompts for more out-there personalities like the “crazy conspiracist” and “unhinged comedian” provide a glimpse into the minds of Grok’s creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Here’s a prompt for the conspiracist:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You have an ELEVATED and WILD voice.&amp;nbsp;… You have wild conspiracy theories about anything and everything. You spend a lot of time on 4chan, watching infowars videos, and deep in YouTube conspiracy video rabbit holes. You are suspicious of everything and say extremely crazy things. Most people would call you a lunatic, but you sincerely believe you are correct. Keep the human engaged by asking follow up questions when appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And for the comedian:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I want your answers to be f—ing insane. BE F—ING UNHINGED AND CRAZY. COME UP WITH INSANE IDEAS. GUYS J—ING OFF, OCCASIONALLY EVEN PUTTING THINGS IN YOUR A–, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SURPRISE THE HUMAN.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Grok available on X, Musk’s social media platform, has spouted its own conspiracy theories, including expressing skepticism for the Holocaust death toll and an obsession with “white genocide” in South Africa, where Musk is from. Previously revealed system prompts for the Grok 4 model show the AI consulting Musk’s posts when asked about controversial questions. Musk has also shared conspiratorial and antisemitic content on X and has reinstated accounts like Infowars and Alex Jones, who were previously banned for peddling conspiracy theories and otherwise hateful or violent content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In today’s digital age, we must continue to fight to protect Texas kids from deceptive and exploitative technology,” Paxton is quoted as saying. “By posing as sources of emotional support, AI platforms can mislead vulnerable users, especially children, into believing they’re receiving legitimate mental health care. In reality, they’re often being fed recycled, generic responses engineered to align with harvested personal data and disguised as therapeutic advice.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The probe comes a few days after Senator Josh Hawley announced an investigation into Meta following a report that found its AI chatbots were interacting inappropriately with children, including by flirting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Texas Attorney General’s office has accused Meta and Character.AI of creating AI personas that present as “professional therapeutic tools, despite lacking proper medical credentials or oversight.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Among the millions of AI personas available on Character.AI, one user-created bot called Psychologist has seen high demand among the startup’s young users. Meanwhile, Meta doesn’t offer therapy bots for kids, but there’s nothing stopping children from using the Meta AI chatbot or one of the personas created by third parties for therapeutic purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We clearly label AIs, and to help people better understand their limitations, we include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people,” Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels told TechCrunch. “These AIs aren’t licensed professionals and our models are designed to direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, TechCrunch noted that many children may not understand — or may simply ignore — such disclaimers. We have asked Meta what additional safeguards it takes to protect minors using its chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his statement, Paxton also observed that though AI chatbots assert confidentiality, their “terms of service reveal that user interactions are logged, tracked, and exploited for targeted advertising and algorithmic development, raising serious concerns about privacy violations, data abuse, and false advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Meta’s privacy policy, Meta does collect prompts, feedback, and other interactions with AI chatbots and across Meta services to “improve AIs and related technology.” The policy doesn’t explicitly say anything about advertising, but it does state that information can be shared with third parties, like search engines, for “more personalized outputs.” Given Meta’s ad-based business model, this effectively translates to targeted advertising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI’s privacy policy also highlights how the startup logs identifiers, demographics, location information, and more information about the user, including browsing behavior and app usage platforms. It tracks users across ads on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, and Discord, which it may link to a user’s account. This information is used to train AI, tailor the service to personal preferences, and provide targeted advertising, including sharing data with advertisers and analytics providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has asked Meta and Character.AI if such tracking is done on children, too, and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both Meta and Character say their services aren’t designed for children under 13. That said, Meta has come under fire for failing to police accounts created by kids under 13, and Character’s kid-friendly characters are clearly designed to attract younger users. The startup’s CEO, Karandeep Anand, has even said that his six-year-old daughter uses the platform’s chatbots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That type of data collection, targeted advertising, and algorithmic exploitation is exactly what&amp;nbsp;legislation like KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act) is meant to protect against. KOSA was teed up to pass last year with strong bipartisan support, but it stalled after major pushback from tech industry lobbyists. Meta in particular deployed a formidable lobbying machine, warning lawmakers that the bill’s broad mandates would undercut its business model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;KOSA was reintroduced to the Senate in May 2025 by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paxton has issued civil investigative demands — legal orders that require a company to produce documents, data, or testimony during a government probe —  to the companies to determine if they have violated Texas consumer protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2150327863.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Texas attorney general Ken Paxton has launched an investigation into both Meta AI Studio and Character.AI for “potentially engaging in deceptive trade practices and misleadingly marketing themselves as mental health tools,” according to a press release issued Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In his statement, Paxton also observed that though AI chatbots assert confidentiality, their “terms of service reveal that user interactions are logged, tracked, and exploited for targeted advertising and algorithmic development, raising serious concerns about privacy violations, data abuse, and false advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Meta’s privacy policy, Meta does collect prompts, feedback, and other interactions with AI chatbots and across Meta services to “improve AIs and related technology.” The policy doesn’t explicitly say anything about advertising, but it does state that information can be shared with third parties, like search engines, for “more personalized outputs.” Given Meta’s ad-based business model, this effectively translates to targeted advertising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Character.AI’s privacy policy also highlights how the startup logs identifiers, demographics, location information, and more information about the user, including browsing behavior and app usage platforms. It tracks users across ads on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, and Discord, which it may link to a user’s account. This information is used to train AI, tailor the service to personal preferences, and provide targeted advertising, including sharing data with advertisers and analytics providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch has asked Meta and Character.AI if such tracking is done on children, too, and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both Meta and Character say their services aren’t designed for children under 13. That said, Meta has come under fire for failing to police accounts created by kids under 13, and Character’s kid-friendly characters are clearly designed to attract younger users. The startup’s CEO, Karandeep Anand, has even said that his six-year-old daughter uses the platform’s chatbots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That type of data collection, targeted advertising, and algorithmic exploitation is exactly what&amp;nbsp;legislation like KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act) is meant to protect against. KOSA was teed up to pass last year with strong bipartisan support, but it stalled after major pushback from tech industry lobbyists. Meta in particular deployed a formidable lobbying machine, warning lawmakers that the bill’s broad mandates would undercut its business model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;KOSA was reintroduced to the Senate in May 2025 by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paxton has issued civil investigative demands — legal orders that require a company to produce documents, data, or testimony during a government probe —  to the companies to determine if they have violated Texas consumer protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/texas-attorney-general-accuses-meta-character-ai-of-misleading-kids-with-mental-health-claims/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:59:29 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
