Generative AI (gen AI) is enabling attackers to craft 10,000 personalized phishing emails per minute using scraped LinkedIn profiles and corporate communications. NIST’s 2030 quantum deadline threatens retroactive decryption of $425 billion in currently protected data. Deepfake fraud that surged 3,000% in 2024 now bypasses biometric authentication in 97% of attempts, forcing security leaders to reimagine defensive architectures fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caption: Software now commands 40% of cybersecurity budgets in 2025, representing an 11 percentage point premium over personnel costs at 29%, as organizations layer security solutions to combat gen AI threats executing in milliseconds.

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise security teams managing 75 or more tools lose $18 million annually to integration and overhead alone. The average detection time remains 277 days, while attacks execute within milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gartner forecasts that interactive application security testing (IAST) tools will lose 80% of market share by 2026. Security Service Edge (SSE) platforms that promised streamlined convergence now add to the complexity they intended to solve. Meanwhile, standalone risk-rating products flood security operations centers with alerts that lack actionable context, leading analysts to spend 67% of their time on false positives, according to IDC’s Security Operations Study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operational math doesn’t work. Analysts require 90 seconds to evaluate each alert, but they receive 11,000 alerts daily. Each additional security tool deployed reduces visibility by 12% and increases attacker dwell time by 23 days, as reported in Mandiant’s 2024 M-Trends Report. Complexity itself has become the enterprise’s greatest cybersecurity vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platform vendors have been selling consolidation for years, capitalizing on the chaos and complexity that app and tool sprawl create. As George Kurtz, CEO of CrowdStrike, explained in a recent VentureBeat interview about competing with a platform in today’s mercurially changing market conditions: “The difference between a platform and platformization is execution. You need to deliver immediate value while building toward a unified vision that eliminates complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike’s Charlotte AI automates alert triage and saves SOC teams over 40 hours every week by classifying millions of detections at 98% accuracy; that equals the output of five seasoned analysts and is fueled by Falcon Complete’s expert-labeled incident corpus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We couldn’t have done this without our Falcon Complete team,” Elia Zaitsev, CTO at CrowdStrike, told VentureBeat in a recent interview. “They do triage as part of their workflow, manually handling millions of detections. That high-quality, human-annotated dataset is what made over 98% accuracy possible. We recognized that adversaries are increasingly leveraging AI to accelerate attacks. With Charlotte AI, we’re giving defenders an equal footing, amplifying their efficiency and ensuring they can keep pace with attackers in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike, Microsoft’s Defender XDR with MDVM/Intune, Palo Alto Networks, Netskope, Tanium and Mondoo now bundle XDR, SIEM and auto-remediation, transforming SOCs from delayed forensics sessions to the ability to perform real-time threat neutralization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-budgets-surge-10-as-gen-ai-attacks-outpace-human-defense"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security budgets surge 10% as gen AI attacks outpace human defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forrester’s guide finds 55% of global security technology decision-makers expect significant budget increases in the next 12 months. 15% anticipate jumps exceeding 10% while 40% expect increases between 5% and 10%. This spending surge reflects an asymmetric battlefield where attackers deploy gen AI to simultaneously target thousands of employees with personalized campaigns crafted from real-time scraped data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are making the most of the advantages they’re getting from adversarial AI, with speed, stealth and highly personalized, target attacks becoming the most lethal. “For years, attackers have been utilizing AI to their advantage,” Mike Riemer, Field CISO at Ivanti, told VentureBeat. “However, 2025 will mark a turning point as defenders begin to harness the full potential of AI for cybersecurity purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3016046" height="463" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/figure-2.jpg?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional spending disparities reveal threat landscape variations and how CISOs are responding to them. Asia Pacific organizations lead with 22% expecting budget increases above 10% versus just 9% in North America. Cloud security, on-premises technology and security awareness training top investment priorities globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-software-dominates-budgets-as-runtime-defenses-become-critical-in-2026"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software dominates budgets as runtime defenses become critical in 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat continues to hear from security leaders about how crucial protecting the inference layer of AI model development is. Many consider it the new frontline of the future of cybersecurity. Inference layers are vulnerable to prompt injection, data exfiltration, or even direct model manipulation. These are all threats that demand millisecond-scale responses, not delayed forensic investigations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forrester’s latest CISO spending guide underscores a profound shift in cybersecurity spending priorities, with cloud security leading all spending increases at 12%, closely followed by investments in on-premises security technology at 11%, and security awareness initiatives at 10%. These priorities reflect the urgency CISOs feel to strengthen defenses precisely at the critical moment of AI model inference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At Reputation, security is baked into our core architecture and enforced rigorously at runtime,” Carter Rees, Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at Reputation, recently told VentureBeat. “The inference layer, the exact moment an AI model interacts with people, data, or tools, is where we apply our most stringent controls. Every interaction includes authenticated tenant and role contexts, verified in real-time by an AI security gateway.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reputation’s multi-tiered approach has become a de facto gold standard, blending proactive and reactive defenses. “Real-time controls immediately take over,” Rees explained. “Our prompt firewall blocks unauthorized or off-topic inputs instantly, restricting tool and data access strictly to user permissions. Behavioral detectors proactively flag anomalies the moment they occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rigorous runtime security approach extends equally into customer-facing systems. “For natural language interactions, our AI only pulls from explicitly customer-approved sources,” Rees noted. “Each generated response must transparently cite its sources. We verify citations match both tenant and context, routing for human review if they do not.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quantum-computing-s-accelerating-risk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum computing’s accelerating risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing is quickly evolving from a theoretical concern into an immediate enterprise threat. Security leaders now face “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) attacks, where adversaries store encrypted data for future quantum-enabled decryption. Widely used encryption methods like 2048-bit RSA risk compromise once quantum processors reach operational scale with tens of thousands of reliable qubits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized three critical Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards in August 2024, mandating encryption algorithm retirement by 2030 and full prohibition by 2035. Global agencies, including Australia’s Signals Directorate, require PQC implementation by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forrester urges organizations to prioritize PQC adoption for protecting sensitive data at rest, in transit, and in use. Security leaders should leverage cryptographic inventory and discovery tools, partnering with cryptoagility providers such as Entrust, IBM, Keyfactor, Palo Alto Networks, QuSecure, SandboxAQ, and Thales. Given quantum’s rapid progression, CISOs need to factor in how they’ll update encryption strategies to avoid obsolescence and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-explosion-of-identities-is-fueling-an-ai-driven-credential-crisis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explosion of identities is fueling an AI-driven credential crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Machine identities now outnumber human users by a staggering 45:1 ratio, fueling a credential crisis beyond human management. Forrester’s guide underscores scaling machine identity management as mission-critical to mitigating emerging threats. Gartner forecasts identity security spending to nearly double, reaching $47.1 billion by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional endpoint approaches aren’t capable of slowing down a growing onslaught of adversarial AI attacks. Ivanti’s Daren Goeson recently told VentureBeat: “As these endpoints multiply, so does their vulnerability. Combining AI with Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) is increasingly essential.” Ivanti’s AI-driven Vulnerability Risk Rating (VRR) illustrates this benefit, enabling organizations to patch vulnerabilities 85% faster by identifying threats traditional scoring methods overlook, making AI-driven credential intelligence enterprise security at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Endpoint devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and IoT devices are essential to modern business operations. However, as their numbers grow, so do the opportunities for attackers to exploit endpoints and their applications, ”Goeson explained. &amp;nbsp;“Factors like an expanded attack surface, insufficient security resources, unpatched vulnerabilities, and outdated software contribute to this rising risk. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines UEM solutions with AI-powered tools, businesses significantly reduce their cyber risk and the impact of attacks,” Goeson advised VentureBeat during a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Forrester saves their immediate call to action in the guide for advising security leaders to begin divesting legacy security tools immediately, with a specific focus on interactive application security testing (IAST), standalone cybersecurity risk-rating (CRR) products, and fragmented Security Service Edge (SSE), SD-WAN, and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, Forrester advises, security leaders need to prioritize more integrated platforms that enhance visibility and streamline management. Unified Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions from Palo Alto Networks and Netskope now provide essential consolidation. At the same time, integrated Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) and continuous monitoring platforms from UpGuard, Panorays and RiskRecon replace standalone CRR tools the consulting firm advises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, automated remediation powered by Microsoft’s MDVM with Intune, Tanium’s endpoint management, and DevOps-focused solutions like Mondoo has emerged as a critical capability for real-time threat neutralization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cisos-must-consolidate-security-at-ai-s-inference-edge-or-risk-losing-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CISOs must consolidate security at AI’s inference edge or risk losing control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consolidating tools at inference’s edge is the future of cybersecurity, especially as AI threats intensify. “For CISOs, the playbook is crystal clear,” Rees concluded. “Consolidate controls decisively at the inference edge. Introduce robust behavioral anomaly detection. Strengthen Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with provenance checks and defined abstain paths. Above all, invest heavily in runtime defenses and support the specialized teams who operate them. Execute this playbook, and you achieve secure AI deployments at true scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, automated remediation powered by Microsoft’s MDVM with Intune, Tanium’s endpoint management, and DevOps-focused solutions like Mondoo has emerged as a critical capability for real-time threat neutralization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cisos-must-consolidate-security-at-ai-s-inference-edge-or-risk-losing-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CISOs must consolidate security at AI’s inference edge or risk losing control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consolidating tools at inference’s edge is the future of cybersecurity, especially as AI threats intensify. “For CISOs, the playbook is crystal clear,” Rees concluded. “Consolidate controls decisively at the inference edge. Introduce robust behavioral anomaly detection. Strengthen Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with provenance checks and defined abstain paths. Above all, invest heavily in runtime defenses and support the specialized teams who operate them. Execute this playbook, and you achieve secure AI deployments at true scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the relationship between the two companies is already showing signs of fraying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At least one of the executives Wang brought over to help run MSL — Scale AI’s former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations, Ruben Mayer — has departed Meta after just two months with the company, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mayer spent roughly five years with Scale AI across two stints. In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn’t part of the company’s TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was “to help set up the lab, with whatever was needed” rather than data, and that he was “part of TBD Labs from day one” rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he “did not report directly to [Wang]” and was “very happy” with his Meta experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the personnel changes, Meta’s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI’s largest competitors, the people said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up –&amp;nbsp; it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor. That makes this situation especially notable: even with Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment, several sources said that researchers in TBD Labs see Scale AI’s data as low quality and have expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Scale AI initially built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce to handle simple data labeling, which is the process of tagging and annotating raw information to train AI models. But as AI models have grown more sophisticated, they now require highly-skilled domain experts—such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists—to generate and refine the high-quality data needed to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Scale AI has moved to attract these subject matter experts with its Outlier platform, competitors like Surge and Mercor have been growing quickly because their business models were built on a foundation of high-paid talent from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Meta spokesperson disputed the fact that there are quality issues with Scale AI’s product. Surge and Mercor declined to comment. Asked about Meta’s deepening reliance on competing data providers, a Scale AI spokesperson directed TechCrunch to its initial announcement of Meta’s investment in the startup, which cites an expansion of the companies’ commercial relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s deals with third-party data vendors likely mean the company is not putting all its eggs in Scale AI, even after investing billions in the startup. The same can’t be said for Scale AI, however. Not long after Meta announced its massive investment with Scale AI, OpenAI and Google said they would stop working with the data provider.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shortly after losing those customers, Scale AI laid off 200 employees in its data labeling business in July, with the company’s new CEO, Jason Droege, blaming the changes in part on “shifts in market demand.” Droege said Scale AI would staff up in other parts of the business, including government sales — the company just landed a $99 million contract with the U.S. Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some speculated initially that Meta’s investment in Scale AI was really to lure Wang, a founder who has operated in the AI space since Scale AI was founded in 2016 and who appears to be helping Meta to attract top AI talent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aside from Wang, there’s an open question around how valuable Scale is to Meta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One current MSL employee says that several of the Scale executives brought over to Meta are not working on the core TBD Labs team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Meta’s AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since bringing on Wang and a wave of top researchers, according to two former employees and one current MSL employee. New talent from OpenAI and Scale AI have expressed frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous GenAI team has seen its scope limited, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tensions indicate that Meta’s largest AI investment to date may be off to a rocky start, despite that it was supposed to address the company’s AI development challenges. After the lackluster launch of Llama 4 in April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew frustrated with the company’s AI team, one current and one former employee told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an effort to turn things around and catch up with OpenAI and Google, Zuckerberg rushed to strike deals and launched an aggressive campaign to recruit top AI talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond Wang, Zuckerberg has managed to pull in top AI researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Meta has also acquired AI voice startups including Play AI and WaveForms AI, and announced a partnership with the AI image generation startup, Midjourney.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To power its AI ambitions, Meta recently announced several massive data center buildouts across the U.S. One of the largest is a $50 billion data center in Louisiana called Hyperion, named after a titan in Greek mythology that fathered the God of Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wang, who’s not an AI researcher by background, was viewed as a somewhat unconventional choice to lead an AI lab. Zuckerberg reportedly held talks to bring in more traditional candidates to lead the effort, such as OpenAI’s chief research officer, Mark Chen, and tried to acquire the startups of Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati. All of them declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of the new AI researchers recently brought in from OpenAI have already left Meta, Wired previously reported. Meanwhile, many longtime members of Meta’s GenAI unit have departed in light of the changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MSL AI researcher Rishabh Agarwal is among the latest, posting on X this week that he’d be leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The pitch from Mark and @alexandr_wang to build in the Superintelligence team was incredibly compelling,” said Agarwal. “But I ultimately choose to follow Mark’s own advice: ‘In a world that’s changing so fast, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Asked afterward about his time at Meta and what drove his decision to leave, Agarwal declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Director of product management for generative AI, Chaya Nayak, and research engineer, Rohan Varma, have also announced their departure from Meta in recent weeks. The question now is whether Meta can stabilize its AI operations and retain the talent it needs for its future success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MSL has already started working on its next generation AI model. According to reports from Business Insider, it’s aiming to launch it by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: This story has been updated with comments from Mayer, who reached out to TechCrunch after publication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1540568234.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s only been since June that Meta invested $14.3 billion in the data-labeling vendor Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several of the startup’s top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL).
