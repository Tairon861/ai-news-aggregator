            &lt;p&gt;Innovator, futurist, and author Ray Kurzweil ’70 emphasized his optimism about artificial intelligence, and technological progress generally, in a lecture on Wednesday while accepting MIT’s&amp;nbsp;Robert A. Muh Alumni Award from the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil offered his signature high-profile forecasts about how AI and computing will entirely blend with human functionality, and proposed that AI will lead to monumental gains in longevity, medicine, and other realms of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People do not appreciate that the rate of progress is accelerating,” Kurzweil said, forecasting “incredible breakthroughs” over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil delivered his lecture, titled “Reinventing Intelligence,” in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, which opened earlier in 2025 on the MIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Muh Award was founded and endowed by Robert A. Muh ’59 and his wife Berit, and is one of the leading alumni honors granted by SHASS and MIT. Muh, a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation, established the award, which is granted every two years for “extraordinary contributions” by alumni in the humanities, arts, and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert and Berit Muh were both present at the lecture, along with their daughter Carrie Muh ’96, ’97, SM ’97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agustín Rayo, dean of SHASS, offered introductory remarks, calling Kurzweil “one of the most prolific thinkers of our time.” Rayo added that Kurzweil “has built his life and career on the belief that ideas change the world, and change it for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has been an innovator in language recognition technologies, developing advances and founding companies that have served people who are blind or low-vision, and helped in music creation. He is also a best-selling author who has heralded advances in computing capabilities, and even the merging of human and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial segment of Kurzweil’s lecture was autobiographical in focus, reflecting on his family and early years. The families of both of Kurzweil’s parents fled the Nazis in Europe, seeking refuge in the U.S., with the belief that people could create a brighter future for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My parents taught me the power of ideas can really change the world,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing an early interest in how things worked, Kurzweil had decided to become an inventor by about the age of 7, he recalled. He also described his mother as being tremendously encouraging to him as a child. The two would take walks together, and the young Kurzweil would talk about all the things he imagined inventing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would tell her my ideas and no matter how fantastical they were, she believed them,” he said. “Now other parents might have simply chuckled … but she actually believed my ideas, and that actually gave me my confidence, and I think confidence is important in succeeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became interested in computing by the early 1960s and majored in both computer science and literature as an MIT undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has a long-running association with MIT extending far beyond his undergraduate studies. He served as a member of the MIT Corporation from 2005 to 2012 and was the 2001 recipient of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize, an award for innovation, for his development of reading technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT has played a major role in my personal and professional life over the years,” Kurzweil said, calling himself “truly honored to receive this award.” Addressing Muh, he added: “Your longstanding commitment to our alma mater is inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from MIT, Kurzweil launched a successful career developing innovative computing products, including one that recognized text across all fonts and could produce an audio reading. He also developed leading-edge music synthesizers, among many other advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a corresponding part of his career, Kurzweil has become an energetic author, whose best-known books include “The Age of Intelligent Machines” (1990), “The Age of Spiritual Machines” (1999), “The Singularity Is Near” (2005), and “The Singularity Is Nearer” (2024), among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil was recently named chief AI officer of Beyond Imagination, a robotics firm he co-founded; he has also held a position at Google in recent years, working on natural language technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kurzweil underscored his view that, as exemplified and enabled by the growth of computing power over time, technological innovation moves at an exponential pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t really think about exponential growth; they think about linear growth,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept, he said, makes him confident that a string of innovations will continue at remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the bigger transformations we’re going to see from AI in the near term is health and medicine,” Kurweil said, forecasting that human medical trials will be replaced by simulated “digital trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also believes computing and AI advances can lead to so many medical advances it will soon produce a drastic improvement in human longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These incredible breakthroughs are going to lead to what we’ll call longevity escape velocity,” Kurzweil said. “By roughly 2032 when you live through a year, you’ll get back an entire year from scientific progress, and beyond that point you’ll get back more than a year for every year you live, so you’ll be going back into time as far as your health is concerned,” Kurweil said. He did offer that these advances will “start” with people who are the most diligent about their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also outlined one of his best-known forecasts, that AI and people will be combined. “As we move forward, the lines between humans and technology will blur, until we are … one and the same,” Kurzweil said. “This is how we learn to merge with AI. In the 2030s, robots the size of molecules will go into our brains, noninvasively, through the capillaries, and will connect our brains directly to the cloud. Think of it like having a phone, but in your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By 2045, once we have fully merged with AI, our intelligence will no longer be constrained … it will expand a millionfold,” he said. “This is what we call the singularity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Kurzweil acknowledged, “Technology has always been a double-edged sword,” given that a drone can deliver either medical supplies or weaponry. “Threats of AI are real, must be taken seriously, [and] I think we are doing that,” he said. In any case, he added, we have “a moral imperative to realize the promise of new technologies while controlling the peril.” He concluded: “We are not doomed to fail to control any of these risks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been trying to recover from a bout of illness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about the immune system, and how little I know about my own immune health. The vast array of cells, proteins, and biomolecules that works to defend us from disease is mind-bogglingly complicated. Immunologists are still getting to grips with how it all works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those of us who aren’t immunologists are even more in the dark. I had my flu jab last week and have no idea how my immune system responded. Will it protect me from the flu virus this winter? Is it “stressed” from whatever other bugs it has encountered in the last few months? And since my husband had his shot at the same time, I can’t help wondering how our responses will compare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I was intrigued to hear about a new test that is being developed to measure immune health. One that even gives you a score.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Writer David Ewing Duncan hoped that the test would reveal more about his health than any other he’d ever taken. He described the experience in a piece published jointly by &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Aventine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The test David took was developed by John Tsang at Yale University and his colleagues. The team wanted to work out a way of measuring how healthy a person’s immune system might be.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s a difficult thing to do, for several reasons. First, there’s the definition of “healthy.” I find it’s a loose concept that becomes more complicated the more you think about it. Yes, we all have a general sense of what it means to be in good health. But is it just the absence of disease? Is it about resilience? Does it have something to do with withstanding the impact of aging?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tsang and his colleagues wanted to measure “deviation from health.” They looked at blood samples from 228 people who had immune diseases that were caused by single-gene mutations, as well as 42 other people who were free from disease. All those individuals could be considered along a health spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another major challenge lies in trying to capture the complexity of the immune system, which involves hundreds of proteins and cells interacting in various ways. (Side note: Last year, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; recognized Ang Cui at Harvard University as one of our Innovators under 35 for her attempts to make sense of it all using machine learning. She created the Immune Dictionary to describe how hundreds of proteins affect immune cells—something she likens to a “periodic table” for the immune system.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tsang and his colleagues tackled this by running a series of tests on those blood samples. The vast scope of these tests is what sets them apart from the blood tests you might get during a visit to the doctor. The team looked at how genes were expressed by cells in the blood. They measured a range of immune cells and more than 1,300 proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team members used machine learning to find correlations between these measurements and health, allowing them to create an immune health score for each of the volunteers. They call it the immune health metric, or IHM.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When they used this approach to find the immune scores of people who had already volunteered in other studies, they found that the IHM seemed to align with other measures of health, such as how people respond to diseases, treatments, and vaccines. The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The researchers behind it hope that a test like this could one day help identify people who are at risk of cancer and other diseases, or explain why some people respond differently to treatments or immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the test isn’t ready for clinical use. If, like me, you’re finding yourself curious to know your own IHM, you’ll just have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Most of the time when we talk about muscle memory, we’re not talking about the muscles themselves but about the memory of a coordinated movement pattern that lives in the motor neurons, which control our muscles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet in recent years, scientists have discovered that &lt;em&gt;our muscles themselves&lt;/em&gt; have a memory for movement and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we move a muscle, the movement may appear to begin and end, but all these little changes are actually continuing to happen inside our muscle cells. And the more we move, as with riding a bike or other kinds of exercise, the more those cells begin to make a memory of that exercise.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we move a muscle, the movement may appear to begin and end, but all these little changes are actually continuing to happen inside our muscle cells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We all know from experience that a muscle gets bigger and stronger with repeated work. As the pioneering muscle scientist Adam Sharples—a professor at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo and a former professional rugby player in the UK—explained to me, skeletal muscle cells are unique in the human body: They’re long and skinny, like fibers, and have multiple nuclei. The fibers grow larger not by dividing but by recruiting muscle satellite cells—stem cells specific to muscle that are dormant until activated in response to stress or injury—to contribute their own nuclei and support muscle growth and regeneration. Those nuclei often stick around for a while in the muscle fibers, even after periods of inactivity, and there is evidence that they may help accelerate the return to growth once you start training again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sharples’s research focuses on what’s called epigenetic muscle memory.&lt;strong&gt; “&lt;/strong&gt;Epigenetic” refers to changes in gene expression that are caused by behavior and environment—the genes themselves don’t change, but the way they work does. In general, exercise switches on genes that help make muscles grow more easily. When you lift weights, for example, small molecules called methyl groups detach from the outside of certain genes, making them more likely to turn on and produce proteins that affect muscle growth (also known as hypertrophy). Those changes persist; if you start lifting weights again, you’ll add muscle mass more quickly than before.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Sharples’s muscle lab was the first to show that human skeletal muscle has an epigenetic memory of muscle growth after exercise: Muscle cells are primed to respond more rapidly to exercise in the future, even after a monthslong (and maybe even yearslong) pause. In other words: Your muscles remember how to do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies from Sharples and others have replicated similar findings in mice and older humans, offering further supporting evidence of epigenetic muscle memory across species and into later life. Even aging muscles have the capacity to remember when you work out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Sharples points to intriguing new evidence that muscles also remember periods of atrophy—and that young and old muscles remember this &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt;. While young human muscle seems to have what he calls a “positive” memory of wasting—“in that it recovers well after a first period of atrophy and doesn’t experience greater loss in a repeated atrophy period,” he explains—aged muscle in rats seems to have a more pronounced “negative” memory of atrophy, in which it appears “more susceptible to greater loss and a more exaggerated molecular response when muscle wasting is repeated.” Basically, young muscle tends to bounce back from periods of muscle loss—“ignoring” it, in a sense—while older muscle is more sensitive to it and might be more susceptible to further loss in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Illness can also lead to this kind of “negative” muscle memory; in a study of breast cancer survivors more than a decade after diagnosis and treatment, participants showed an epigenetic muscle profile of people much older than their chronological age. But get this: After five months of aerobic exercise training, participants were able to reset the epigenetic profile of their muscle back toward that of muscle seen in an age-matched control group of healthy women. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What this shows is that “positive” muscle memories can help counteract “negative” ones. The takeaway? Your muscles have their own kind of intelligence. The more you use them, the more they can harness it to become a lasting beneficial resource for your body in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonnie Tsui is the author of&lt;/em&gt; On Muscle: The Stuff That Moves Us and Why It Matters &lt;em&gt;(Algonquin Books, 2025)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thumbnail_MIT-Muscle-Final.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next.

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2008, at 1:59 AM in Calipatria, California, an earthquake happened. You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These machine learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the best-case scenario, when you adopt these new techniques, even on the same old data, it’s kind of like putting on glasses for the first time, and you can see the leaves on the trees,” said Kyle Bradley, co-author of the&amp;nbsp;Earthquake Insights newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked with several earthquake scientists, and they all agreed that machine learning methods have replaced humans for the better in these specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really remarkable,” Judith Hubbard, a Cornell University professor and Bradley’s co-author, told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less certain is what comes next. Earthquake detection is a fundamental part of seismology, but there are many other data processing tasks that have yet to be disrupted. The biggest potential impacts, all the way to earthquake forecasting, haven’t materialized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really was a revolution,” said Joe Byrnes, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. “But the revolution is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;What do seismologists do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an earthquake happens in one place, the shaking passes through the ground, similar to how sound waves pass through the air. In both cases, it’s possible to draw inferences about the materials the waves pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine tapping a wall to figure out if it’s hollow. Because a solid wall vibrates differently than a hollow wall, you can figure out the structure by sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With earthquakes, this same principle holds. Seismic waves pass through different materials (rock, oil, magma, etc.) differently, and scientists use these vibrations to image the Earth’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tool that scientists traditionally use is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;seismometer&lt;/em&gt;. These record the movement of the Earth in three directions: up–down, north–south, and east–west. If an earthquake happens, seismometers can measure the shaking in that particular location.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists then process raw seismometer information to identify earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes produce multiple types of shaking, which travel at different speeds. Two types, Primary (P) waves and Secondary (S) waves are particularly important, and scientists like to identify the start of each of these phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Finding quakes before machine learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before good algorithms, earthquake cataloging had to happen by hand. Byrnes said that “traditionally, something like the lab at the United States Geological Survey would have an army of mostly undergraduate students or interns looking at seismograms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are only so many earthquakes you can find and classify manually. Creating algorithms to effectively find and process earthquakes has long been a priority in the field—especially since the arrival of computers in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The field of seismology historically has always advanced as computing has advanced,” Bradley told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a big challenge with traditional algorithms, though: They can’t easily find smaller quakes, especially in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see in the seismogram above, many different events can cause seismic signals. If a method is too sensitive, it risks falsely detecting events as earthquakes. The problem is especially bad in cities, where the constant hum of traffic and buildings can drown out small earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, earthquakes have a characteristic “shape.” The magnitude 7.7 earthquake above looks quite different from the helicopter landing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one idea scientists had was to make templates from human-labeled datasets. If a new waveform correlates closely with an existing template, it’s almost certainly an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Template matching works very well if you have enough human-labeled examples. In 2019, Zach Ross’s lab at Caltech used template matching to&amp;nbsp;find 10 times as many earthquakes in Southern California as had previously been known, including the earthquake at the start of this story. Almost all of the new 1.6 million quakes they found were very small, magnitude 1 and below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an extensive pre-existing dataset of templates, however, you can’t easily apply template matching. That isn’t a problem in Southern California—which already had a basically complete record of earthquakes down to magnitude 1.7—but it’s a challenge elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, template matching is computationally expensive. Creating a Southern California quake dataset using template matching took 200 Nvidia P100 GPUs running for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Breaking down the Earthquake Transformer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI detection models solve all of these problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;They are faster than template matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;Because AI detection models are very small (around 350,000 parameters compared to billions in LLMs like GPT4.0), they can be run on consumer CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;AI models generalize well to regions not represented in the original dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, AI models can give better information about when the different types of earthquake shaking arrive. Timing the arrivals of the two most important waves—P and S waves—is called &lt;em&gt;phase picking.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;It allows scientists to draw inferences about the structure of the quake. AI models can do this alongside earthquake detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic task of earthquake detection (and phase picking) looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2120127 align-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The first three rows represent different directions of vibration (east–west, north–south, and up–down respectively). Given these three dimensions of vibration, can we determine if an earthquake occurred, and if so, when it started?&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;We want to detect the initial P wave, which arrives directly from the site of the earthquake. But this can be tricky because echoes of the P wave may get reflected off other rock layers and arrive later, making the waveform more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;Ideally, then, our model outputs three things at every time step in the sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="sc-n2r23q-11 fHhWJP"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that an earthquake is occurring at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that the first P wave arrives at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that the first S wave arrives at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;We see all three outputs in the fourth row: the detection in green, the P wave arrival in blue, and the S wave arrival in red. (There are two earthquakes in this sample.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;To train an AI model, scientists take large amounts of labeled data, like what’s above, and do supervised training. I’ll describe one of the most used models: Earthquake Transformer, which was developed around 2020 by a Stanford University team led by S. Mostafa Mousavi, who later became a Harvard professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many earthquake detection models, Earthquake Transformer adapts ideas from image classification. Readers may be familiar with AlexNet, a famous image-recognition model that kicked off the deep learning boom&amp;nbsp;in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AlexNet used convolutions, a neural network architecture that’s based on the idea that pixels that are physically close together are more likely to be related. The first convolutional layer of AlexNet broke an image down into small chunks—11 pixels on a side—and classified each chunk based on the presence of simple features like edges or gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next layer took the first layer’s classifications as input and checked for higher-level concepts such as textures or simple shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each convolutional layer analyzed a larger portion of the image and operated at a higher level of abstraction. By the final layers, the network was looking at the entire image and identifying objects like “mushroom” and “container ship.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Images are two-dimensional, so AlexNet is based on two-dimensional convolutions. In contrast, seismograph data is one-dimensional, so Earthquake Transformer uses one-dimensional convolutions over the time dimension. The first layer analyzes vibration data in 0.1-second chunks, while later layers identify patterns over progressively longer time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to say what exact patterns the earthquake model is picking out, but we can analogize this to a hypothetical audio transcription model using one-dimensional convolutions. That model might first identify consonants, then syllables, then words, then sentences over increasing time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Transformer converts raw waveform data into a collection of high-level representations that indicate the likelihood of earthquakes and other seismologically significant events. This is followed by a series of deconvolution layers that pinpoint exactly when an earthquake—and its all-important P and S waves—occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also uses an attention layer in the middle of the model to mix information between different parts of the time series. The attention mechanism is most famous in&amp;nbsp;large language models, where it helps pass information between words. It plays a similar role in seismographic detection. Earthquake seismograms have a general structure: P waves followed by S waves followed by other types of shaking. So if a segment looks like the start of a P wave, the attention mechanism helps it check that it fits into a broader earthquake pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Scaling earthquake data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Earthquake Transformer’s components are standard designs from the neural network literature. Other successful detection models, like&amp;nbsp;PhaseNet, are even simpler. PhaseNet uses only one-dimensional convolutions to pick the arrival times of earthquake waves. There are no attention layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there hasn’t been “much need to invent new architectures for seismology,” according to Byrnes. The techniques derived from image processing have been sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made these generic architectures work so well then? Data. Lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars has previously reported&amp;nbsp;on how the introduction of&amp;nbsp;ImageNet, an image recognition benchmark, helped spark the deep learning boom. Large, publicly available earthquake datasets have played a similar role in seismology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Transformer was trained using the&amp;nbsp;Stanford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD), which contains 1.2 million human-labeled segments of seismogram data from around the world. (The paper for STEAD explicitly&amp;nbsp;mentions ImageNet as an inspiration). Other models, like PhaseNet, were also trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of labeled segments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of the data and the architecture just works. The current models are “comically good” at identifying and classifying earthquakes, according to Byrnes. Typically, machine learning methods find ten or more times the quakes that were previously identified in an area. You can see this directly in an Italian earthquake catalog:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI tools won’t necessarily detect more earthquakes than template matching. But AI-based techniques are much less compute- and labor-intensive, making them more accessible to the average research project and easier to apply in regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, these machine learning models are so good that they’ve almost completely supplanted traditional methods for detecting and phase-picking earthquakes, especially for smaller magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;What does all this AI stuff do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of earthquake science is earthquake prediction. For instance, scientists&amp;nbsp;know that a large quake will happen near Seattle but have little ability to know whether it will happen tomorrow or in a hundred years. It would be helpful if we could predict earthquakes precisely enough to allow people in affected areas to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think AI tools would help predict earthquakes, but that doesn’t seem to have happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications are more technical and less flashy, said Cornell’s Judith Hubbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better AI models have given seismologists much more comprehensive earthquake catalogs, which have unlocked “a lot of different techniques,” Bradley said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest applications is in understanding and imaging volcanoes. Volcanic activity produces a large number of small earthquakes, whose locations help scientists understand the structure of the magma system. In a 2022&amp;nbsp;paper, John Wilding and co-authors used a large AI-generated earthquake catalog to create this incredible image of the structure of the Hawaiian volcanic system.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They provided direct evidence of a previously hypothesized magma connection between the deep Pāhala sill complex and Mauna Loa’s shallow volcanic structure. You can see this in the image with the arrow labeled as Pāhala-Mauna Loa seismicity band. The authors were also able to clarify the structure of the Pāhala sill complex into discrete sheets of magma. This level of detail could potentially facilitate better real-time monitoring of earthquakes and more accurate eruption forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another promising area is lowering the cost of dealing with huge datasets.&amp;nbsp;Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a powerful technique that uses fiber-optic cables to measure seismic activity across the entire length of the cable. A single DAS array can produce “hundreds of gigabytes of data” a day, according to Jiaxuan Li, a professor at the University of Houston. That much data can produce extremely high-resolution datasets—enough to pick out individual footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools make it possible to very accurately time earthquakes in DAS data. Before the introduction of AI techniques for phase picking in DAS data, Li and some of his collaborators attempted to use traditional techniques. While these “work roughly,” they weren’t accurate enough for their downstream analysis. Without AI, much of his work would have been “much harder,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li is also optimistic that AI tools will be able to help him isolate “new types of signals” in the rich DAS data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all AI techniques have paid off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in many other scientific fields, seismologists face some pressure to adopt AI methods, whether or not they are relevant to their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The schools want you to put the word AI in front of everything,” Byrnes said. “It’s a little out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to papers that are technically sound but practically useless. Hubbard and Bradley told me that they’ve seen a lot of papers based on AI techniques that “reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how earthquakes work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pointed out that graduate students can feel pressure to specialize in AI methods at the cost of learning less about the fundamentals of the scientific field. They fear that if this type of AI-driven research becomes entrenched, older methods will get “out-competed by a kind of meaninglessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are real issues, and ones Understanding AI has&amp;nbsp;reported on before, I don’t think they detract from the success of AI earthquake detection. In the last five years, an AI-based workflow has almost completely replaced one of the fundamental tasks in seismology for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2008, at 1:59 AM in Calipatria, California, an earthquake happened. You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These machine learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the best-case scenario, when you adopt these new techniques, even on the same old data, it’s kind of like putting on glasses for the first time, and you can see the leaves on the trees,” said Kyle Bradley, co-author of the&amp;nbsp;Earthquake Insights newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked with several earthquake scientists, and they all agreed that machine learning methods have replaced humans for the better in these specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really remarkable,” Judith Hubbard, a Cornell University professor and Bradley’s co-author, told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less certain is what comes next. Earthquake detection is a fundamental part of seismology, but there are many other data processing tasks that have yet to be disrupted. The biggest potential impacts, all the way to earthquake forecasting, haven’t materialized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really was a revolution,” said Joe Byrnes, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. “But the revolution is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;What do seismologists do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an earthquake happens in one place, the shaking passes through the ground, similar to how sound waves pass through the air. In both cases, it’s possible to draw inferences about the materials the waves pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine tapping a wall to figure out if it’s hollow. Because a solid wall vibrates differently than a hollow wall, you can figure out the structure by sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With earthquakes, this same principle holds. Seismic waves pass through different materials (rock, oil, magma, etc.) differently, and scientists use these vibrations to image the Earth’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tool that scientists traditionally use is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;seismometer&lt;/em&gt;. These record the movement of the Earth in three directions: up–down, north–south, and east–west. If an earthquake happens, seismometers can measure the shaking in that particular location.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists then process raw seismometer information to identify earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes produce multiple types of shaking, which travel at different speeds. Two types, Primary (P) waves and Secondary (S) waves are particularly important, and scientists like to identify the start of each of these phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Finding quakes before machine learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before good algorithms, earthquake cataloging had to happen by hand. Byrnes said that “traditionally, something like the lab at the United States Geological Survey would have an army of mostly undergraduate students or interns looking at seismograms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are only so many earthquakes you can find and classify manually. Creating algorithms to effectively find and process earthquakes has long been a priority in the field—especially since the arrival of computers in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The field of seismology historically has always advanced as computing has advanced,” Bradley told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a big challenge with traditional algorithms, though: They can’t easily find smaller quakes, especially in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2120121 align-fullwidth"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="fullwidth full" height="480" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4730ac1e-6fae-4249-a6b6-653fc65aae6b_640x480.webp" width="640" /&gt;

      Composite seismogram of common events. Note how each event has a slightly different shape.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see in the seismogram above, many different events can cause seismic signals. If a method is too sensitive, it risks falsely detecting events as earthquakes. The problem is especially bad in cities, where the constant hum of traffic and buildings can drown out small earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, earthquakes have a characteristic “shape.” The magnitude 7.7 earthquake above looks quite different from the helicopter landing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one idea scientists had was to make templates from human-labeled datasets. If a new waveform correlates closely with an existing template, it’s almost certainly an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Template matching works very well if you have enough human-labeled examples. In 2019, Zach Ross’s lab at Caltech used template matching to&amp;nbsp;find 10 times as many earthquakes in Southern California as had previously been known, including the earthquake at the start of this story. Almost all of the new 1.6 million quakes they found were very small, magnitude 1 and below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an extensive pre-existing dataset of templates, however, you can’t easily apply template matching. That isn’t a problem in Southern California—which already had a basically complete record of earthquakes down to magnitude 1.7—but it’s a challenge elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, template matching is computationally expensive. Creating a Southern California quake dataset using template matching took 200 Nvidia P100 GPUs running for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Breaking down the Earthquake Transformer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI detection models solve all of these problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;They are faster than template matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;Because AI detection models are very small (around 350,000 parameters compared to billions in LLMs like GPT4.0), they can be run on consumer CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;AI models generalize well to regions not represented in the original dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, AI models can give better information about when the different types of earthquake shaking arrive. Timing the arrivals of the two most important waves—P and S waves—is called &lt;em&gt;phase picking.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;It allows scientists to draw inferences about the structure of the quake. AI models can do this alongside earthquake detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic task of earthquake detection (and phase picking) looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2120127 align-fullwidth"&gt;

&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The first three rows represent different directions of vibration (east–west, north–south, and up–down respectively). Given these three dimensions of vibration, can we determine if an earthquake occurred, and if so, when it started?&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;We want to detect the initial P wave, which arrives directly from the site of the earthquake. But this can be tricky because echoes of the P wave may get reflected off other rock layers and arrive later, making the waveform more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;Ideally, then, our model outputs three things at every time step in the sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="sc-n2r23q-11 fHhWJP"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that an earthquake is occurring at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that the first P wave arrives at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;The probability that the first S wave arrives at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;We see all three outputs in the fourth row: the detection in green, the P wave arrival in blue, and the S wave arrival in red. (There are two earthquakes in this sample.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="sc-1o72qur-1 hDESMK"&gt;To train an AI model, scientists take large amounts of labeled data, like what’s above, and do supervised training. I’ll describe one of the most used models: Earthquake Transformer, which was developed around 2020 by a Stanford University team led by S. Mostafa Mousavi, who later became a Harvard professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many earthquake detection models, Earthquake Transformer adapts ideas from image classification. Readers may be familiar with AlexNet, a famous image-recognition model that kicked off the deep learning boom&amp;nbsp;in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AlexNet used convolutions, a neural network architecture that’s based on the idea that pixels that are physically close together are more likely to be related. The first convolutional layer of AlexNet broke an image down into small chunks—11 pixels on a side—and classified each chunk based on the presence of simple features like edges or gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next layer took the first layer’s classifications as input and checked for higher-level concepts such as textures or simple shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each convolutional layer analyzed a larger portion of the image and operated at a higher level of abstraction. By the final layers, the network was looking at the entire image and identifying objects like “mushroom” and “container ship.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Images are two-dimensional, so AlexNet is based on two-dimensional convolutions. In contrast, seismograph data is one-dimensional, so Earthquake Transformer uses one-dimensional convolutions over the time dimension. The first layer analyzes vibration data in 0.1-second chunks, while later layers identify patterns over progressively longer time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to say what exact patterns the earthquake model is picking out, but we can analogize this to a hypothetical audio transcription model using one-dimensional convolutions. That model might first identify consonants, then syllables, then words, then sentences over increasing time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Transformer converts raw waveform data into a collection of high-level representations that indicate the likelihood of earthquakes and other seismologically significant events. This is followed by a series of deconvolution layers that pinpoint exactly when an earthquake—and its all-important P and S waves—occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model also uses an attention layer in the middle of the model to mix information between different parts of the time series. The attention mechanism is most famous in&amp;nbsp;large language models, where it helps pass information between words. It plays a similar role in seismographic detection. Earthquake seismograms have a general structure: P waves followed by S waves followed by other types of shaking. So if a segment looks like the start of a P wave, the attention mechanism helps it check that it fits into a broader earthquake pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;Scaling earthquake data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Earthquake Transformer’s components are standard designs from the neural network literature. Other successful detection models, like&amp;nbsp;PhaseNet, are even simpler. PhaseNet uses only one-dimensional convolutions to pick the arrival times of earthquake waves. There are no attention layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there hasn’t been “much need to invent new architectures for seismology,” according to Byrnes. The techniques derived from image processing have been sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made these generic architectures work so well then? Data. Lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars has previously reported&amp;nbsp;on how the introduction of&amp;nbsp;ImageNet, an image recognition benchmark, helped spark the deep learning boom. Large, publicly available earthquake datasets have played a similar role in seismology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Transformer was trained using the&amp;nbsp;Stanford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD), which contains 1.2 million human-labeled segments of seismogram data from around the world. (The paper for STEAD explicitly&amp;nbsp;mentions ImageNet as an inspiration). Other models, like PhaseNet, were also trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of labeled segments.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of the data and the architecture just works. The current models are “comically good” at identifying and classifying earthquakes, according to Byrnes. Typically, machine learning methods find ten or more times the quakes that were previously identified in an area. You can see this directly in an Italian earthquake catalog:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI tools won’t necessarily detect more earthquakes than template matching. But AI-based techniques are much less compute- and labor-intensive, making them more accessible to the average research project and easier to apply in regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, these machine learning models are so good that they’ve almost completely supplanted traditional methods for detecting and phase-picking earthquakes, especially for smaller magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="header-anchor-post"&gt;What does all this AI stuff do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of earthquake science is earthquake prediction. For instance, scientists&amp;nbsp;know that a large quake will happen near Seattle but have little ability to know whether it will happen tomorrow or in a hundred years. It would be helpful if we could predict earthquakes precisely enough to allow people in affected areas to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think AI tools would help predict earthquakes, but that doesn’t seem to have happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications are more technical and less flashy, said Cornell’s Judith Hubbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better AI models have given seismologists much more comprehensive earthquake catalogs, which have unlocked “a lot of different techniques,” Bradley said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest applications is in understanding and imaging volcanoes. Volcanic activity produces a large number of small earthquakes, whose locations help scientists understand the structure of the magma system. In a 2022&amp;nbsp;paper, John Wilding and co-authors used a large AI-generated earthquake catalog to create this incredible image of the structure of the Hawaiian volcanic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2120134 align-none"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="alt" class="none large" height="587" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9b4ff1f3-45ab-4851-a288-4ffb920d6a61_1250x717-1024x587.webp" width="1024" /&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They provided direct evidence of a previously hypothesized magma connection between the deep Pāhala sill complex and Mauna Loa’s shallow volcanic structure. You can see this in the image with the arrow labeled as Pāhala-Mauna Loa seismicity band. The authors were also able to clarify the structure of the Pāhala sill complex into discrete sheets of magma. This level of detail could potentially facilitate better real-time monitoring of earthquakes and more accurate eruption forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another promising area is lowering the cost of dealing with huge datasets.&amp;nbsp;Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a powerful technique that uses fiber-optic cables to measure seismic activity across the entire length of the cable. A single DAS array can produce “hundreds of gigabytes of data” a day, according to Jiaxuan Li, a professor at the University of Houston. That much data can produce extremely high-resolution datasets—enough to pick out individual footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools make it possible to very accurately time earthquakes in DAS data. Before the introduction of AI techniques for phase picking in DAS data, Li and some of his collaborators attempted to use traditional techniques. While these “work roughly,” they weren’t accurate enough for their downstream analysis. Without AI, much of his work would have been “much harder,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li is also optimistic that AI tools will be able to help him isolate “new types of signals” in the rich DAS data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all AI techniques have paid off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in many other scientific fields, seismologists face some pressure to adopt AI methods, whether or not they are relevant to their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The schools want you to put the word AI in front of everything,” Byrnes said. “It’s a little out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to papers that are technically sound but practically useless. Hubbard and Bradley told me that they’ve seen a lot of papers based on AI techniques that “reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how earthquakes work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pointed out that graduate students can feel pressure to specialize in AI methods at the cost of learning less about the fundamentals of the scientific field. They fear that if this type of AI-driven research becomes entrenched, older methods will get “out-competed by a kind of meaninglessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are real issues, and ones Understanding AI has&amp;nbsp;reported on before, I don’t think they detract from the success of AI earthquake detection. In the last five years, an AI-based workflow has almost completely replaced one of the fundamental tasks in seismology for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

And the more we move, as with riding a bike or other kinds of exercise, the more those cells begin to make a memory of that exercise.
