And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS re:Invent 2025, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-werner-out"&gt;Werner out …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference — and it looks like this will be his last one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;

									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 13-15, 2026&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is my final re:Invent keynote,” he said, then quickly added he is not leaving the company. “I’m not leaving Amazon or anything like that, but I think that after 14 re:Invents you guys are owed young, fresh, new voices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vogels then spent more than an hour talking to a packed room before ending with a “Werner, out” and a literal mic drop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-ai-take-your-job"&gt;Will AI take your job? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vogels spent much of the closing keynote talking about AI and its role in the future, including the looming threat that it will take away jobs. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Will AI take my job? Maybe,” Vogels asked and answered, before noting that some tasks will be automated, and some skills will become obsolete. “So maybe we should rephrase and reframe this question. Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-gen-cpu"&gt;Next-gen CPU&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS unveiled its Graviton5 CPU on Thursday, the next-generation chip that the company promises will be its highest performing, most efficient yet. The Graviton5 contains 192 processor cores, a dense and efficient design that AWS says reduces the distance data must travel between cores. That helps cut inter-core communication latency by up to 33% while increasing bandwidth, the company said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doubling-down-on-llms"&gt;Doubling down on LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own models. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andy-jassy-shares-some-numbers"&gt;Andy Jassy shares some numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is already bringing in loads of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-database-savings-arrives"&gt;Database savings arrives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well in his blog post, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes"&gt;Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+ to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility"&gt;An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities"&gt;Expanded AgentCore capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee"&gt;A nonstop AI agent worker bee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such&amp;nbsp;as preventing incidents&amp;nbsp;when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-nova-models-and-services"&gt;New Nova models and services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AWS is rolling out four new AI models within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents"&gt;Lyft’s argument for AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that piped up during the event to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center"&gt;An AI Factory for the private data center&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon also announced “AI Factories” that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2179195367.jpg?resize=1200,746" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon Web Services’ annual tech conference AWS re:Invent has wrapped.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference — and it looks like this will be his last one. &lt;/p&gt;

The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material in April. That suit is ongoing. Another nine from these publishers sued the model maker and its cloud provider in November, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits. Reddit filed one in October. Dow Jones is also suing. Last month, while Amazon didn’t sue, it did threaten to by sending a cease-and-desist letter over AI browser shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2169504075.jpg?resize=1200,801" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against AI search engine Perplexity on Thursday alleging copyright infringement. The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material in April. That suit is ongoing. Another nine from these publishers sued the model maker and its cloud provider in November, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits. Reddit filed one in October. Dow Jones is also suing. Last month, while Amazon didn’t sue, it did threaten to by sending a cease-and-desist letter over AI browser shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There are some jobs human bodies just weren’t meant to do. Unloading trucks and shipping containers is a repetitive, grueling task — and a big reason warehouse injury rates are more than twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pickle Robot Company wants its machines to do the heavy lifting. The company’s one-armed robots autonomously unload trailers, picking up boxes weighing up to 50 pounds and placing them onto onboard conveyor belts for warehouses of all types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company name, an homage to The Apple Computer Company, hints at the ambitions of founders AJ Meyer ’09, Ariana Eisenstein ’15, SM ’16, and Dan Paluska ’97, SM ’00. The founders want to make the company the technology leader for supply chain automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s unloading robots combine generative AI and machine-learning algorithms with sensors, cameras, and machine-vision software to navigate new environments on day one and improve performance over time. Much of the company’s hardware is adapted from industrial partners. You may recognize the arm, for instance, from car manufacturing lines — though you may not have seen it in bright pickle-green.&lt;/p&gt;        

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
            &lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content-block-text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          

            &lt;p&gt;The company is already working with customers&amp;nbsp;like UPS, Ryobi Tools, and Yusen Logistics to take a load off warehouse workers, freeing them to solve other supply chain bottlenecks in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are really good edge-case problem solvers, and robots are not,” Paluska says. “How can the robot, which is really good at the brute force, repetitive tasks, interact with humans to solve more problems? Human bodies and minds are so adaptable, the way we sense and respond to the environment is so adaptable, and robots aren’t going to replace that anytime soon. But there’s so much drudgery we can get rid of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding problems for robots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer and Eisenstein majored in computer science and electrical engineering at MIT, but they didn’t work together until after graduation, when Meyer started the technology consultancy Leaf Labs, which specializes in building embedded computer systems for things like robots, cars, and satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A bunch of friends from MIT ran that shop,” Meyer recalls, noting it’s still running today. “Ari worked there, Dan consulted there, and we worked on some big projects. We were the primary software and digital design team behind Project Ara, a smartphone for Google, and we worked on a bunch of interesting government projects. It was really a lifestyle company for MIT kids. But 10 years go by, and we thought, ‘We didn’t get into this to do consulting. We got into this to do robots.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Meyer graduated in 2009, problems like robot dexterity seemed insurmountable. By 2018, the rise of algorithmic approaches like neural networks had brought huge advances to robotic manipulation and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out what problem to solve with robots, the founders talked to people in industries as diverse as agriculture, food prep, and hospitality. At some point, they started visiting logistics warehouses, bringing a stopwatch to see how long it took workers to complete different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 2018, we went to a UPS warehouse and watched 15 guys unloading trucks during a winter night shift,” Meyer recalls. “We spoke to everyone, and not a single person had worked there for more than 90 days. We asked, ‘Why not?’ They laughed at us. They said, ‘Have you tried to do this job before?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out warehouse turnover is one of the industry’s biggest problems, limiting productivity as managers constantly grapple with hiring, onboarding, and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders raised a seed funding round and built robots that could sort boxes because it was an easier problem that allowed them to work with technology like grippers and barcode scanners. Their robots eventually worked, but the company wasn’t growing fast enough to be profitable. Worse yet, the founders were having trouble raising money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were desperately low on funds,” Meyer recalls. “So we thought, ‘Why spend our last dollar on a warm-up task?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With money dwindling, the founders built a proof-of-concept robot that could unload trucks reliably for about 20 seconds at a time and posted a video of it on YouTube. Hundreds of potential customers reached out. The interest was enough to get investors back on board to keep the company alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company piloted its first unloading system for a year with a customer in the desert of California, sparing human workers from unloading shipping containers that can reach temperatures up to&amp;nbsp;130 degrees in the summer. It has since scaled deployments with multiple customers and gained traction among third-party logistics centers across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s robotic arm is made by the German&amp;nbsp;industrial robotics&amp;nbsp;giant KUKA. The robots are mounted on a custom mobile base with an onboard computing systems&amp;nbsp;so they can navigate to docks and adjust their positions inside trailers autonomously while lifting. The end of each arm features a suction gripper that clings to packages and moves them to the onboard conveyor belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s robots can pick up boxes ranging in size from 5-inch cubes to 24-by-30 inch boxes. The robots can unload anywhere from 400 to 1,500 cases per hour depending on size and weight. The company fine tunes pre-trained generative AI models and uses a number of smaller models to ensure the robot runs smoothly in every setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also developing a&amp;nbsp;software platform it can integrate with third-party hardware, from humanoid robots to autonomous forklifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our immediate product roadmap is load and unload,” Meyer says. “But we’re also hoping to connect these third-party platforms. Other companies are also trying to connect robots. What does it mean for the robot unloading a truck to talk to the robot palletizing, or for the forklift to talk to the inventory drone? Can they do the job faster? I think there’s a big network coming in which we need to orchestrate the robots and the automation across the entire supply chain, from the mines to the factories to your front door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why not us?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pickle Robot Company employs about 130 people in its office in Charlestown, Massachusetts, where a standard — if green — office gives way to a warehouse where its robots can be seen loading boxes onto conveyor belts alongside human workers and manufacturing lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, Pickle will be ramping up production of a new version of its system, with further plans to begin designing a two-armed robot sometime after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My supervisor at Leaf Labs once told me ‘No one knows what they’re doing, so why not us?’” Eisenstein says. “I carry that with me all the time. I’ve been very lucky to be able to work with so many talented, experienced people in my career. They all bring their own skill sets and understanding. That’s a massive opportunity — and it’s the only way something as hard as what we’re doing is going to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the company sees many other robot-shaped problems for its machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t start out by saying, ‘Let’s load and unload a truck,’” Meyers says. “We said, ‘What does it take to make a great robot business?’ Unloading trucks is the first chapter. Now we’ve built a platform to make the next robot that helps with more jobs, starting in logistics but then ultimately in manufacturing, retail, and hopefully the entire supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;

On the other end was Joe Biden’s voice, urging Democrats to “save your vote” by skipping the primary. It sounded authentic, but it wasn’t. The call was a fake, generated by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the technology behind that hoax looks quaint. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora now make it possible to create convincing synthetic videos with astonishing ease. AI can be used to fabricate messages from politicians and celebrities—even entire news clips—in minutes. The fear that elections could be overwhelmed by realistic fake media has gone mainstream—and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s only half the story. The deeper threat isn’t that AI can just imitate people—it’s that it can actively persuade people. And new research published this week shows just how powerful that persuasion can be. In two large peer-reviewed studies, AI chatbots shifted voters’ views by a substantial margin, far more than traditional political advertising tends to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, we will see the rise of AI that can personalize arguments, test what works, and quietly reshape political views at scale. That shift—from imitation to active persuasion—should worry us deeply.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The challenge is that modern AI doesn’t just copy voices or faces; it holds conversations, reads emotions, and tailors its tone to persuade. And it can now command other AIs—directing image, video, and voice models to generate the most convincing content for each target. Putting these pieces together, it’s not hard to imagine how one could build a coordinated persuasion machine. One AI might write the message, another could create the visuals, another could distribute it across platforms and watch what works. No humans required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decade ago, mounting an effective online influence campaign typically meant deploying armies of people running fake accounts and meme farms. Now that kind of work can be automated—cheaply and invisibly. The same technology that powers customer service bots and tutoring apps can be repurposed to nudge political opinions or amplify a government’s preferred narrative. And the persuasion doesn’t have to be confined to ads or robocalls. It can be woven into the tools people already use every day—social media feeds, language learning apps, dating platforms, or even voice assistants built and sold by parties trying to influence the American public. That kind of influence could come from malicious actors using the APIs of popular AI tools people already rely on, or from entirely new apps built with the persuasion baked in from the start.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And it’s affordable. For less than a million dollars, anyone can generate personalized, conversational messages for every registered voter in America. The math isn’t complicated. Assume 10 brief exchanges per person—around 2,700 tokens of text—and price them at current rates for ChatGPT’s API. Even with a population of 174 million registered voters, the total still comes in under $1 million. The 80,000 swing voters who decided the 2016 election could be targeted for less than $3,000.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although this is a challenge in elections across the world, the stakes for the United States are especially high, given the scale of its elections and the attention they attract from foreign actors. If the US doesn’t move fast, the next presidential election in 2028, or even the midterms in 2026, could be won by whoever automates persuasion first.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2028 threat&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there have been indications that the threat AI poses to elections is overblown, a growing body of research suggests the situation could be changing. Recent studies have shown that GPT-4 can exceed the persuasive capabilities of communications experts when generating statements on polarizing US political topics, and it is more persuasive than non-expert humans two-thirds of the time when debating real voters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two major studies published yesterday extend those findings to real election contexts in the United States, Canada, Poland, and the United Kingdom, showing that brief chatbot conversations can move voters’ attitudes by up to 10 percentage points, with US participant opinions shifting nearly four times more than it did in response to tested 2016 and 2020 political ads. And when models were explicitly optimized for persuasion, the shift soared to 25 percentage points—an almost unfathomable difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While previously confined to well-resourced companies, modern large language models are becoming increasingly easy to use. Major AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google wrap their frontier models in usage policies, automated safety filters, and account-level monitoring, and they do sometimes suspend users who violate those rules. But those restrictions apply only to traffic that goes through their platforms; they don’t extend to the rapidly growing ecosystem of open-source and open-weight models, which&amp;nbsp; can be downloaded by anyone with an internet connection. Though they’re usually smaller and less capable than their commercial counterparts, research has shown with careful prompting and fine-tuning, these models can now match the performance of leading commercial systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this means that actors, whether well-resourced organizations or grassroots collectives, have a clear path to deploying politically persuasive AI at scale. Early demonstrations have already occurred elsewhere in the world. In India’s 2024 general election, tens of millions of dollars were reportedly spent on AI to segment voters, identify swing voters, deliver personalized messaging through robocalls and chatbots, and more. In Taiwan, officials and researchers have documented China-linked operations using generative AI to produce more subtle disinformation, ranging from deepfakes to language model outputs that are biased toward messaging approved by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s only a matter of time before this technology comes to US elections—if it hasn’t already. Foreign adversaries are well positioned to move first. China, Russia, Iran, and others already maintain networks of troll farms, bot accounts, and covert influence operators. Paired with open-source language models that generate fluent and localized political content, those operations can be supercharged. In fact, there is no longer a need for human operators who understand the language or the context. With light tuning, a model can impersonate a neighborhood organizer, a union rep, or a disaffected parent without a person ever setting foot in the country. Political campaigns themselves will likely be close behind. Every major operation already segments voters, tests messages, and optimizes delivery. AI lowers the cost of doing all that. Instead of poll-testing a slogan, a campaign can generate hundreds of arguments, deliver them one on one, and watch in real time which ones shift opinions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The underlying fact is simple: Persuasion has become effective and cheap. Campaigns, PACs, foreign actors, advocacy groups, and opportunists are all playing on the same field—and there are very few rules.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The policy vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most policymakers have not caught up. Over the past several years, legislators in the US have focused on deepfakes but have ignored the wider persuasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Foreign governments have begun to take the problem more seriously. The European Union’s 2024 AI Act classifies election-related persuasion as a “high-risk” use case. Any system designed to influence voting behavior is now subject to strict requirements. Administrative tools, like AI systems used to plan campaign events or optimize logistics, are exempt. However, tools that aim to shape political beliefs or voting decisions are not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States has so far refused to draw any meaningful lines. There are no binding rules about what constitutes a political influence operation, no external standards to guide enforcement, and no shared infrastructure for tracking AI-generated persuasion across platforms. The federal and state governments have gestured toward regulation—the Federal Election Commission is applying old fraud provisions, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed narrow disclosure rules for broadcast ads, and a handful of states have passed deepfake laws—but these efforts are piecemeal and leave most digital campaigning untouched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, the responsibility for detecting and dismantling covert campaigns has been left almost entirely to private companies, each with its own rules, incentives, and blind spots. Google and Meta have adopted policies requiring disclosure when political ads are generated using AI. X has remained largely silent on this, while TikTok bans all paid political advertising. However, these rules, modest as they are, cover only the sliver of content that is bought and publicly displayed. They say almost nothing about the unpaid, private persuasion campaigns that may matter most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To their credit, some firms have begun publishing periodic threat reports identifying covert influence campaigns. Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and Google have all disclosed takedowns of inauthentic accounts. However, these efforts are voluntary and not subject to independent auditing. Most important, none of this prevents determined actors from bypassing platform restrictions altogether with open-source models and off-platform infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a real strategy would look like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United States does not need to ban AI from political life. Some applications may even strengthen democracy. A well-designed candidate chatbot could help voters understand where the candidate stands on key issues, answer questions directly, or translate complex policy into plain language. Research has even shown that AI can reduce belief in conspiracy theories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, there are a few things the United States should do to protect against the threat of AI persuasion. First, it must guard against foreign-made political technology with built-in persuasion capabilities. Adversarial political technology could take the form of a foreign-produced video game where in-game characters echo political talking points, a social media platform whose recommendation algorithm tilts toward certain narratives, or a language learning app that slips subtle messages into daily lessons. Evaluations, such as the Center for AI Standards and Innovation’s recent analysis of DeepSeek, should focus on identifying and assessing AI products—particularly from countries like China, Russia, or Iran—before they are widely deployed. This effort would require coordination among intelligence agencies, regulators, and platforms to spot and address risks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should lead in shaping the rules around AI-driven persuasion. That includes tightening access to computing power for large-scale foreign persuasion efforts, since many actors will either rent existing models or lease the GPU capacity to train their own. It also means establishing clear technical standards—through governments, standards bodies, and voluntary industry commitments—for how AI systems capable of generating political content should operate, especially during sensitive election periods. And domestically, the United States needs to determine what kinds of disclosures should apply to AI-generated political messaging while navigating First Amendment concerns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, foreign adversaries will try to evade these safeguards—using offshore servers, open-source models, or intermediaries in third countries. That is why the United States also needs a foreign policy response. Multilateral election integrity agreements should codify a basic norm: States that deploy AI systems to manipulate another country’s electorate risk coordinated sanctions and public exposure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doing so will likely involve building shared monitoring infrastructure, aligning disclosure and provenance standards, and being prepared to conduct coordinated takedowns of cross-border persuasion campaigns—because many of these operations are already moving into opaque spaces where our current detection tools are weak. The US should also push to make election manipulation part of the broader agenda at forums like the G7 and OECD, ensuring that threats related to AI persuasion are treated not as isolated tech problems but as collective security challenges.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the task of securing elections cannot fall to the United States alone. A functioning radar system for AI persuasion will require partnerships with our partners and allies. Influence campaigns are rarely confined by borders, and open-source models and offshore servers will always exist. The goal is not to eliminate them but to raise the cost of misuse and shrink the window in which they can operate undetected across jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The era of AI persuasion is just around the corner, and America’s adversaries are prepared. In the US, on the other hand, the laws are out of date, the guardrails too narrow, and the oversight largely voluntary. If the last decade was shaped by viral lies and doctored videos, the next will be shaped by a subtler force: messages that sound reasonable, familiar, and just persuasive enough to change hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For China, Russia, Iran, and others, exploiting America’s open information ecosystem is a strategic opportunity. We need a strategy that treats AI persuasion not as a distant threat but as a present fact. That means soberly assessing the risks to democratic discourse, putting real standards in place, and building a technical and legal infrastructure around them. Because if we wait until we can see it happening, it will already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tal Feldman is a JD candidate at Yale Law School who focuses on technology and national security.

On the other end was Joe Biden’s voice, urging Democrats to “save your vote” by skipping the primary. It sounded authentic, but it wasn’t. The call was a fake, generated by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the technology behind that hoax looks quaint. Tools like OpenAI’s Sora now make it possible to create convincing synthetic videos with astonishing ease. AI can be used to fabricate messages from politicians and celebrities—even entire news clips—in minutes. The fear that elections could be overwhelmed by realistic fake media has gone mainstream—and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s only half the story. The deeper threat isn’t that AI can just imitate people—it’s that it can actively persuade people. And new research published this week shows just how powerful that persuasion can be. In two large peer-reviewed studies, AI chatbots shifted voters’ views by a substantial margin, far more than traditional political advertising tends to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the coming years, we will see the rise of AI that can personalize arguments, test what works, and quietly reshape political views at scale. That shift—from imitation to active persuasion—should worry us deeply.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The challenge is that modern AI doesn’t just copy voices or faces; it holds conversations, reads emotions, and tailors its tone to persuade. And it can now command other AIs—directing image, video, and voice models to generate the most convincing content for each target. Putting these pieces together, it’s not hard to imagine how one could build a coordinated persuasion machine. One AI might write the message, another could create the visuals, another could distribute it across platforms and watch what works. No humans required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decade ago, mounting an effective online influence campaign typically meant deploying armies of people running fake accounts and meme farms. Now that kind of work can be automated—cheaply and invisibly. The same technology that powers customer service bots and tutoring apps can be repurposed to nudge political opinions or amplify a government’s preferred narrative. And the persuasion doesn’t have to be confined to ads or robocalls. It can be woven into the tools people already use every day—social media feeds, language learning apps, dating platforms, or even voice assistants built and sold by parties trying to influence the American public. That kind of influence could come from malicious actors using the APIs of popular AI tools people already rely on, or from entirely new apps built with the persuasion baked in from the start.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And it’s affordable. For less than a million dollars, anyone can generate personalized, conversational messages for every registered voter in America. The math isn’t complicated. Assume 10 brief exchanges per person—around 2,700 tokens of text—and price them at current rates for ChatGPT’s API. Even with a population of 174 million registered voters, the total still comes in under $1 million. The 80,000 swing voters who decided the 2016 election could be targeted for less than $3,000.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although this is a challenge in elections across the world, the stakes for the United States are especially high, given the scale of its elections and the attention they attract from foreign actors. If the US doesn’t move fast, the next presidential election in 2028, or even the midterms in 2026, could be won by whoever automates persuasion first.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2028 threat&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there have been indications that the threat AI poses to elections is overblown, a growing body of research suggests the situation could be changing. Recent studies have shown that GPT-4 can exceed the persuasive capabilities of communications experts when generating statements on polarizing US political topics, and it is more persuasive than non-expert humans two-thirds of the time when debating real voters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two major studies published yesterday extend those findings to real election contexts in the United States, Canada, Poland, and the United Kingdom, showing that brief chatbot conversations can move voters’ attitudes by up to 10 percentage points, with US participant opinions shifting nearly four times more than it did in response to tested 2016 and 2020 political ads. And when models were explicitly optimized for persuasion, the shift soared to 25 percentage points—an almost unfathomable difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;While previously confined to well-resourced companies, modern large language models are becoming increasingly easy to use. Major AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google wrap their frontier models in usage policies, automated safety filters, and account-level monitoring, and they do sometimes suspend users who violate those rules. But those restrictions apply only to traffic that goes through their platforms; they don’t extend to the rapidly growing ecosystem of open-source and open-weight models, which&amp;nbsp; can be downloaded by anyone with an internet connection. Though they’re usually smaller and less capable than their commercial counterparts, research has shown with careful prompting and fine-tuning, these models can now match the performance of leading commercial systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this means that actors, whether well-resourced organizations or grassroots collectives, have a clear path to deploying politically persuasive AI at scale. Early demonstrations have already occurred elsewhere in the world. In India’s 2024 general election, tens of millions of dollars were reportedly spent on AI to segment voters, identify swing voters, deliver personalized messaging through robocalls and chatbots, and more. In Taiwan, officials and researchers have documented China-linked operations using generative AI to produce more subtle disinformation, ranging from deepfakes to language model outputs that are biased toward messaging approved by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s only a matter of time before this technology comes to US elections—if it hasn’t already. Foreign adversaries are well positioned to move first. China, Russia, Iran, and others already maintain networks of troll farms, bot accounts, and covert influence operators. Paired with open-source language models that generate fluent and localized political content, those operations can be supercharged. In fact, there is no longer a need for human operators who understand the language or the context. With light tuning, a model can impersonate a neighborhood organizer, a union rep, or a disaffected parent without a person ever setting foot in the country. Political campaigns themselves will likely be close behind. Every major operation already segments voters, tests messages, and optimizes delivery. AI lowers the cost of doing all that. Instead of poll-testing a slogan, a campaign can generate hundreds of arguments, deliver them one on one, and watch in real time which ones shift opinions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The underlying fact is simple: Persuasion has become effective and cheap. Campaigns, PACs, foreign actors, advocacy groups, and opportunists are all playing on the same field—and there are very few rules.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The policy vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most policymakers have not caught up. Over the past several years, legislators in the US have focused on deepfakes but have ignored the wider persuasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Foreign governments have begun to take the problem more seriously. The European Union’s 2024 AI Act classifies election-related persuasion as a “high-risk” use case. Any system designed to influence voting behavior is now subject to strict requirements. Administrative tools, like AI systems used to plan campaign events or optimize logistics, are exempt. However, tools that aim to shape political beliefs or voting decisions are not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States has so far refused to draw any meaningful lines. There are no binding rules about what constitutes a political influence operation, no external standards to guide enforcement, and no shared infrastructure for tracking AI-generated persuasion across platforms. The federal and state governments have gestured toward regulation—the Federal Election Commission is applying old fraud provisions, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed narrow disclosure rules for broadcast ads, and a handful of states have passed deepfake laws—but these efforts are piecemeal and leave most digital campaigning untouched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, the responsibility for detecting and dismantling covert campaigns has been left almost entirely to private companies, each with its own rules, incentives, and blind spots.

Makeup and then genetic optimization,” exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads. To his mind, one should be as accessible as the other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nucleus is a young, attention-seeking genetic software company that says it can analyze genetic tests on IVF embryos to score them for 2,000 traits and disease risks, letting parents pick some and reject others. This is possible because of how our DNA shapes us, sometimes powerfully. As one of the subway banners reminded the New York riders: “Height is 80% genetic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The day after the campaign launched, Sadeghi and I had briefly sparred online. He’d been on X showing off a phone app where parents can click through traits like eye color and hair color. I snapped back that all this sounded a lot like Uber Eats—another crappy, frictionless future invented by entrepreneurs, but this time you’d click for a baby.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I agreed to meet Sadeghi that night in the station under a banner that read, “IQ is 50% genetic.” He appeared in a puffer jacket and told me the campaign would soon spread to 1,000 train cars. Not long ago, this was a secretive technology to whisper about at Silicon Valley dinner parties. But now? “Look at the stairs. The entire subway is genetic optimization. We’re bringing it mainstream,” he said. “I mean, like, we are normalizing it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Normalizing what, exactly? The ability to choose embryos on the basis of predicted traits could lead to healthier people. But the traits mentioned in the subway—height and IQ—focus the public’s mind toward cosmetic choices and even naked discrimination. “I think people are going to read this and start realizing: Wow, it is now an option that I can pick. I can have a taller, smarter, healthier baby,” says Sadeghi.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sadeghi poses under the first in a row of advertisements. The one above him reads, &amp;quot;Nucleus IVF+ Have a healthier baby.&amp;quot; with the word &amp;quot;healthier&amp;quot; emphasized." class="wp-image-1128788" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2257.jpg?w=1681" width="1681" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur Kian Sadeghi stands under advertising banner in the Broadway-Lafayette subway station in Manhattan, part of a campaign called "Have Your Best Baby."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nucleus got its seed funding from Founders Fund, an investment firm known for its love of contrarian bets. And embryo scoring fits right in—it’s an unpopular concept, and professional groups say the genetic predictions aren’t reliable. So far, leading IVF clinics still refuse to offer these tests. Doctors worry, among other things, that they’ll create unrealistic parental expectations.

Indeed, I learned from Sadeghi that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had objected to parts of the campaign. The metro agency, for instance, did not let Nucleus run ads saying “Have a girl” and “Have a boy,” even though it’s very easy to identify the sex of an embryo using a genetic test. The reason was an MTA policy that forbids using government-owned infrastructure to promote “invidious discrimination” against protected classes, which include race, religion and biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since 2023, New York City has also included height and weight in its anti-discrimination law, the idea being to “root out bias” related to body size in housing and in public spaces. So I’m not sure why the MTA let Nucleus declare that height is 80% genetic. (The MTA advertising department didn’t respond to questions.) Perhaps it’s because the statement is a factual claim, not an explicit call to action. But we all know what to do: Pick the tall one and leave shorty in the IVF freezer, never to be born.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article first appeared in The Checkup,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;weekly biotech newsletter.

Makeup and then genetic optimization,” exulted Kian Sadeghi, the 26-year-old founder of Nucleus Genomics, the startup running the ads. To his mind, one should be as accessible as the other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nucleus is a young, attention-seeking genetic software company that says it can analyze genetic tests on IVF embryos to score them for 2,000 traits and disease risks, letting parents pick some and reject others. This is possible because of how our DNA shapes us, sometimes powerfully. As one of the subway banners reminded the New York riders: “Height is 80% genetic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The day after the campaign launched, Sadeghi and I had briefly sparred online. He’d been on X showing off a phone app where parents can click through traits like eye color and hair color. I snapped back that all this sounded a lot like Uber Eats—another crappy, frictionless future invented by entrepreneurs, but this time you’d click for a baby.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I agreed to meet Sadeghi that night in the station under a banner that read, “IQ is 50% genetic.” He appeared in a puffer jacket and told me the campaign would soon spread to 1,000 train cars. Not long ago, this was a secretive technology to whisper about at Silicon Valley dinner parties. But now? “Look at the stairs. The entire subway is genetic optimization. We’re bringing it mainstream,” he said. “I mean, like, we are normalizing it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Normalizing what, exactly? The ability to choose embryos on the basis of predicted traits could lead to healthier people. But the traits mentioned in the subway—height and IQ—focus the public’s mind toward cosmetic choices and even naked discrimination. “I think people are going to read this and start realizing: Wow, it is now an option that I can pick. I can have a taller, smarter, healthier baby,” says Sadeghi.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sadeghi poses under the first in a row of advertisements.

And embryo scoring fits right in—it’s an unpopular concept, and professional groups say the genetic predictions aren’t reliable. So far, leading IVF clinics still refuse to offer these tests. Doctors worry, among other things, that they’ll create unrealistic parental expectations.

Microsoft’s attempt in the form of Windows Mobile was reaching the end of its road by 2010, and despite Apple’s iOS/iPadOS and macOS moving very slowly towards one another for the last few years, Cupertino has not yet reached the fabled goal of the-one-OS-to-rule-them-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google’s big play to merge ChromeOS and Android into a unified PC platform (with the anglicised codename Aluminium OS) is gradually taking shape. Android-powered laptops are planned for released in 2026, and the company wants to put its LLMs at the centre of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware procurement decisions may be in step with company AI strategy in the enterprise, therefore, in the coming year. The prospect of chromebook-style devices and an accompanying lower price tag will be attractive both to organisations considering their next round of machine refreshes, and strategists who want to put AI at the heart of their employees’ daily work could. Soon, they might have a solution in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s early days in the development of the converged device at Google, but the company is well known for both floating ideas that don’t get far and abandoning technologies it can’t monetise effectively enough. Unlike some of the company’s projects that may stem from its ‘20%’ policy (employees at Google are encouraged to dedicate 20% of their time to moonshot projects), the substantial Android development community and Google’s policy of putting Gemini front-and-centre may be the accelerant the new, converged operating system needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android’s existing AI capabilities like the Magic Editor for photos, audio transcription and summarisation would port very well to the workplace desktop. However, if Google wants to assuage the fears of security professionals, it may have to rely on local, small models for AI processing, rather than reaching out to cloud instances of Gemini for the required compute power. That puts into question the continuation of one of the chromebook range’s big selling points – its low price compared to fully-fledged workstations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a delicate balance the company needs to strike. Forcing users into an AI-centric workflow hasn’t played well for Microsoft: note the furore around Recall and the muted response to its much-reduced offspring that has sprung out of Copilot Labs. What Google needs is a killer AI feature that benefits the enterprise, and that may or may not be something that’s aimed at users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that the addition of Gemini to Google Workspace has done wonders for the platform in terms of its competitiveness with Office 365 – despite a significant price hike earlier this year – driven in some part by new features like live translation in Google Meet and AI responses available in Gmail. Users &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; find some AI tools useful, but it may be becoming apparent that user-facing AI is a useful addition to existing workflows, rather than a catalyst that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If placing Gemini or Gemini Nano at the heart of the new operating system, therefore, it may be that Google is looking to offer value to different parts of the enterprise from the daily tasks users tackle. &lt;i&gt;Android Authority&lt;/i&gt; suggests smart power management, device provisioning, and contextual awareness in accessing enterprise resources may be on the table. It’s difficult to see how these elements would be a game-changer for procurement teams, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has many problems to solve at a deeper level, like compatibility with peripherals, OS-level drivers, and the necssary changes to the Android GUI to make it a great experience for end users wielding mouse and keyboard. But given enough effort and investment (something the company does not lack) these are issues that can be surmounted relatively easily. A thriving app ecosystem will ensure that the necessary tools are if not immediately available, could be made so with minimum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the success of Aluminium OS will depend on Google’s ability to offer a platform that solves tangible problems and integrates into existing workflows. Google sees AI in the form of Gemini (or localised Gemini Nano instance) powering a platform that offers integrated problem-solving. Hitting that target will generate demand, and a lower price per machine could be the decider for procurement teams. If Google gets it right, it could repeat the success it experienced in the education market with the original chromebook project, and there could be a substantial shift by enterprise fleets to Aluminium OS and Google Workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are big gains to be made for a company that dominates the mobile market worldwide and makes serious inroads into the enterprise workstation market.

The partnership involves specific funding to fast-track product development and establish shared operating standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology currently sits on the horizon for most roadmaps, yet economic modelling suggests a contribution of £11 billion to UK GDP by 2045, supporting over 100,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To catalyse this, a £6 million joint R&amp;amp;D funding call launches in early 2026, with Innovate UK and VDI contributing £3 million each. This capital aims to help businesses bring new products to market rather than funding purely academic study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply chain maturity remains a hurdle. An £8 million investment in the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow addresses this by bolstering the development of applied photonics; a necessary component for commercial quantum sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-hurdles-in-the-uk-germany-and-beyond-to-commercialise-quantum-supercomputing"&gt;Addressing hurdles in the UK, Germany, and beyond to commercialise quantum supercomputing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory fragmentation often stalls adoption. A new Memorandum of Understanding between the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and Germany’s Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) aims to harmonise measurement standards. This agreement complements the NMI-Q initiative, a global effort to develop shared norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Science Minister Lord Vallance said: “Quantum technology will revolutionise fields such as cybersecurity, drug discovery, medical imaging, and much more. International collaboration is crucial to unlocking these benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, these advances allow pharmaceutical firms to identify new medicines faster. Similarly, next-generation sensors promise medical scanners that are more affordable, portable, and accurate than current iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership also extends to high-performance computing (HPC). The UK’s National Supercomputing Centre at the University of Edinburgh was selected by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking to host the UK’s AI Factory Antenna, partnering with the HammerHAI AI Factory in Stuttgart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support HPC integration prior to the commercialisation of quantum supercomputing technology, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is allocating up to £3.9 million to match fund UK participation in three open EuroHPC calls. This funding assists teams developing exascale and AI-ready software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aerospace sector, the two nations recently committed joint funding of over €6 billion to the European Space Agency. This includes €1 billion for launch programmes and €10 million for Rocket Factory Augsburg, which plans to launch from Scotland in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier concluded his visit at Siemens Healthineers in Oxford. The site produces superconducting magnets for MRI scanners, an existing example of how bilateral science ties support high-skilled manufacturing and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this bilateral cooperation deepens, the integrated approach between the UK and Germany toward supercomputing and quantum infrastructure aims to offer enterprises a powerful foundation for scaling high-performance workloads across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS re:Invent 2025: Frontier AI agents replace chatbots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-110949" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-18.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The partnership involves specific funding to fast-track product development and establish shared operating standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology currently sits on the horizon for most roadmaps, yet economic modelling suggests a contribution of £11 billion to UK GDP by 2045, supporting over 100,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To catalyse this, a £6 million joint R&amp;amp;D funding call launches in early 2026, with Innovate UK and VDI contributing £3 million each. This capital aims to help businesses bring new products to market rather than funding purely academic study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supply chain maturity remains a hurdle. An £8 million investment in the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow addresses this by bolstering the development of applied photonics; a necessary component for commercial quantum sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-hurdles-in-the-uk-germany-and-beyond-to-commercialise-quantum-supercomputing"&gt;Addressing hurdles in the UK, Germany, and beyond to commercialise quantum supercomputing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory fragmentation often stalls adoption. A new Memorandum of Understanding between the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and Germany’s Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) aims to harmonise measurement standards. This agreement complements the NMI-Q initiative, a global effort to develop shared norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Science Minister Lord Vallance said: “Quantum technology will revolutionise fields such as cybersecurity, drug discovery, medical imaging, and much more. International collaboration is crucial to unlocking these benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, these advances allow pharmaceutical firms to identify new medicines faster.
