    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters at a private dinner that investors are overexcited about AI models. "Someone" will lose a "phenomenal amount of money," he said, according to The Verge. The statement came as his company negotiates a secondary share sale at a $500 billion valuation—up from $300 billion just months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes," Altman told the journalists, comparing the current market to the dot-com crash of the 1990s. Wired reported that he also predicted his company will spend "trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future" and that ChatGPT will soon serve "billions of people a day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, Facebook serves about 3 billion monthly active users. Altman's projection would require ChatGPT to reach nearly half the world's population as daily users (not monthly, like Facebook), which is an extraordinarily optimistic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altman's bubble comments happened to land just before Fortune covered new MIT research showing widespread enterprise AI failures. The study, titled "GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025," found that 95 percent of enterprise AI pilots fail to deliver rapid revenue acceleration. The research analyzed 300 public AI deployments, surveyed 350 employees, and included 150 interviews with business leaders, although Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong noted this week that the MIT report "reads like something given away on the 'research' page of a large consultancy." Its conclusions are fairly obvious, he said: People like ChatGPT for basic tasks and hate complicated enterprise systems, and companies that try to build their own AI usually fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study attributes these failures to implementation problems rather than model quality. "The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the 'learning gap' for both tools and organizations," Fortune wrote about the study. Purchased AI tools succeed 67 percent of the time, while internally built systems succeed only one-third as often. This isn't necessarily an indictment of AI technology as a whole—it's potentially an indictment of corporate IT departments thinking they can out-engineer existing applications from AI service providers like OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Still, the coincidence between Altman's statement and the MIT report reportedly spooked tech stock investors earlier in the week, who have already been watching AI valuations climb to extraordinary heights. Palantir trades at 280 times forward earnings. During the dot-com peak, ratios of 30 to 40 times earnings marked bubble territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparent contradiction in Altman's overall message is notable. This isn't how you'd expect a tech executive to talk when they believe their industry faces imminent collapse. While warning about a bubble, he's simultaneously seeking a valuation that would make OpenAI worth more than Walmart or ExxonMobil—companies with actual profits. OpenAI hit $1 billion in monthly revenue in July but is reportedly heading toward a $5 billion annual loss. So what's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Altman's statements over time reveals a potential multi-level strategy. He likes to talk big. In February 2024, he reportedly sought an audacious $5 trillion–7 trillion for AI chip fabrication—larger than the entire semiconductor industry—effectively normalizing astronomical numbers in AI discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By August 2025, while warning of a bubble where someone will lose a "phenomenal amount of money," he casually mentioned that OpenAI would "spend trillions on datacenter construction" and serve "billions daily." This creates urgency while potentially insulating OpenAI from criticism—acknowledging the bubble exists while positioning his company's infrastructure spending as different and necessary. When economists raised concerns, Altman dismissed them by saying, "Let us do our thing," framing trillion-dollar investments as inevitable for human progress while making OpenAI's $500 billion valuation seem almost reasonable by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual messaging—catastrophic warnings paired with trillion-dollar ambitions—might seem contradictory, but it makes more sense when you consider the unique structure of today's AI market, which is absolutely flush with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different kind of bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current AI investment cycle differs from previous technology bubbles. Unlike dot-com era startups that burned through venture capital with no path to profitability, the largest AI investors—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon—generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual profits from their core businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alone plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers this fiscal year. These companies can potentially sustain losses from AI development for years without facing the cash crises that typically trigger bubble collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Back then, you had a lot of over-leveraged situations. You didn't have a lot of companies that had earnings," Citi's Rob Rowe said on CNBC. "Here you're talking about companies that have very solid earnings, very strong cash flow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural difference matters. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, hundreds of companies vanished overnight because they ran out of money. Today's AI investors can absorb losses that would have killed entire companies two decades ago. If there is a bubble, it might deflate gradually over years rather than pop in a sudden crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, deep pockets don't guarantee product success. OpenAI's CEO recently acknowledged problems with the messy GPT-5 launch, which others are using as evidence that the AI industry is in trouble. But the AI market is now much larger than just OpenAI, with Google, Meta, and Anthropic among those fiercely competing for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the struggles with AI in enterprise and his own bubble warnings, Altman remains bullish on AI's long-term trajectory. The technology continues to improve despite its drawbacks and misapplications, and major companies keep increasing their investments rather than pulling back. Whether current valuations make sense in the short term is one question; whether AI will eventually transform the economy is another entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I do think some investors are likely to get very burnt here, and that sucks. And I don't want to minimize that," Altman told the reporters last week. "But on the whole, it is my belief that... the value created by AI for society will be tremendous."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

This creates urgency while potentially insulating OpenAI from criticism—acknowledging the bubble exists while positioning his company's infrastructure spending as different and necessary. When economists raised concerns, Altman dismissed them by saying, "Let us do our thing," framing trillion-dollar investments as inevitable for human progress while making OpenAI's $500 billion valuation seem almost reasonable by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual messaging—catastrophic warnings paired with trillion-dollar ambitions—might seem contradictory, but it makes more sense when you consider the unique structure of today's AI market, which is absolutely flush with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A different kind of bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current AI investment cycle differs from previous technology bubbles. Unlike dot-com era startups that burned through venture capital with no path to profitability, the largest AI investors—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon—generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual profits from their core businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alone plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers this fiscal year. These companies can potentially sustain losses from AI development for years without facing the cash crises that typically trigger bubble collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Back then, you had a lot of over-leveraged situations. You didn't have a lot of companies that had earnings," Citi's Rob Rowe said on CNBC. "Here you're talking about companies that have very solid earnings, very strong cash flow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural difference matters. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, hundreds of companies vanished overnight because they ran out of money. Today's AI investors can absorb losses that would have killed entire companies two decades ago. If there is a bubble, it might deflate gradually over years rather than pop in a sudden crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, deep pockets don't guarantee product success. OpenAI's CEO recently acknowledged problems with the messy GPT-5 launch, which others are using as evidence that the AI industry is in trouble. But the AI market is now much larger than just OpenAI, with Google, Meta, and Anthropic among those fiercely competing for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the struggles with AI in enterprise and his own bubble warnings, Altman remains bullish on AI's long-term trajectory. The technology continues to improve despite its drawbacks and misapplications, and major companies keep increasing their investments rather than pulling back. Whether current valuations make sense in the short term is one question; whether AI will eventually transform the economy is another entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I do think some investors are likely to get very burnt here, and that sucks. And I don't want to minimize that," Altman told the reporters last week. "But on the whole, it is my belief that... the value created by AI for society will be tremendous."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The request was made public in a brief filed Thursday in Elon Musk’s ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI. Lawyers representing OpenAI said they subpoenaed Meta in June for documents related to its potential involvement in Musk’s unsolicited, $97 billion bid to takeover the startup in February. It’s unclear from the filing whether such documents exists. OpenAI ultimately denied Musk’s bid.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s lawyers say they discovered that Musk communicated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning xAI’s bid to purchase the ChatGPT-maker, including “about potential financing arrangements or investments.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta objected to OpenAI’s initial subpoena in July; the ChatGPT-maker’s lawyers are now seeking a court order to obtain such evidence. OpenAI is also asking the court for any of Meta’s documents and communications related to “any actual or potential restructuring or recapitalization of OpenAI” — the core issue in Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed TechCrunch towards a section of OpenAI’s filing which states that neither Meta nor Zuckerberg signed Musk’s letter of intent to acquire the ChatGPT-maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta declined to comment further. OpenAI and legal counsel for Musk did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the background of OpenAI’s fight with Musk, Meta has significantly invested in its own efforts to develop frontier AI models. In 2023, Meta executives obsessed over developing an AI model that could beat OpenAI’s GPT-4, court filings in another case revealed. By early 2025, Meta’s AI models fell behind the industry standard, reportedly infuriating Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zuckerberg has upped the pressure in recent months, poaching several of OpenAI’s leading AI researchers, including a co-creator of ChatGPT, Shengjia Zhao, who now leads research efforts at the company’s newest AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta also invested $14 billion in Scale AI, and reportedly approached several other AI labs about acquisition deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While it’s unclear how far talks developed between Musk and Zuckerberg, the mere idea of a partnership between the two billionaires represents just how much of a threat OpenAI is. Two years ago, Musk said he would physically fight Zuckerberg in a cage match (it never happened though). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The rise of AI may have prompted Musk and Zuckerberg to set aside their differences.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The briefing disclosed Thursday is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI that takes issue with OpenAI’s conversion of its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Such a conversion is necessary for OpenAI to obtain funding from investors, and eventually go public. However, Musk — a cofounder and early investor in OpenAI — has attempted to throw a wrench in the endeavor, claiming that the restructuring goes against the startup’s founding mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lawyers representing Meta asked the court to reject OpenAI’s request for evidence, arguing that Musk and xAI can provide any relevant information. Meta also argues that its internal discussions of OpenAI’s restructuring and recapitalization are not relevant to the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the FugakuNEXT International Initiative Launch Ceremony held in Tokyo on Aug. 22, leaders from RIKEN, Japan’s top research institute, announced the start of an international collaboration with Fujitsu and NVIDIA to co-design FugakuNEXT, the successor to the world-renowned supercomputer, Fugaku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awarded early in the process, the contract enables the partners to work side by side in shaping the system’s architecture to address Japan’s most critical research priorities — from earth systems modeling and disaster resilience to drug discovery and advanced manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than an upgrade, the effort will highlight Japan’s embrace of modern AI and showcase Japanese innovations that can be harnessed by researchers and enterprises across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony featured remarks from the initiative’s leaders, RIKEN President Makoto Gonokami and Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science and one of Japan’s most respected high-performance computing architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu Chief Technology Officer Vivek Mahajan attended, emphasizing the company’s role in advancing Japan’s computing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing at NVIDIA, attended in person as well to discuss the collaborative design approach and how the resulting platform will serve as a foundation for innovation well into the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum has been building. When NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang touched down in Tokyo last year, he called on Japan to seize the moment — to put NVIDIA’s latest technologies to work building its own AI, on its own soil, with its own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT answers that call, drawing on NVIDIA’s whole software stack —&amp;nbsp; from NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries such as NVIDIA cuQuantum for quantum simulation, RAPIDS for data science, NVIDIA TensorRT for high-performance inference and NVIDIA NeMo for large language model development, to other domain-specific software development kits tailored for science and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovations pioneered on FugakuNEXT could become blueprints for the world. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Inside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT will be a hybrid AI-HPC system, combining simulation and AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will feature FUJITSU-MONAKA-X CPUs, which can be paired with NVIDIA technologies using NVLink Fusion, new silicon enabling high-bandwidth connections between Fujitsu’s CPUs and NVIDIA’s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will be built for speed, scale and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What It Will Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT will support a wide range of applications — such as automating hypothesis generation, code creation and experiment simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientific research: &lt;/b&gt;Accelerating simulations with surrogate models and physics-informed neural networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manufacturing:&lt;/b&gt; Using AI to learn from simulations to generate efficient and aesthetically pleasing designs faster than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Earth systems modeling: &lt;/b&gt;aiding disaster preparedness and prediction for earthquakes and severe weather, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIKEN, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will collaborate on software developments, including tools for mixed-precision computing, continuous benchmarking, and performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FugakuNEXT isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a strategic investment in Japan’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by Japan’s MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), it will serve universities, government agencies, and industry partners nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It marks the start of a new era in Japanese supercomputing — one built on sovereign infrastructure, global collaboration, and a commitment to scientific leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, the company said it would set up a local team in India and open a corporate office in the capital, New Delhi, in the coming months. The move builds on OpenAI’s recent hiring efforts in the region. In April 2024, the company appointed former Truecaller and Meta executive Pragya Mishra as its public policy and partnerships lead in India. OpenAI also brought on former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to help facilitate discussions with the Indian government on AI policy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China — is a natural fit for OpenAI, which is competing with tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI upstarts like Perplexity, all looking to tap into the country’s massive user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that it has started hiring a local team to “focus on strengthening relationships with local partners, governments, businesses, developers, and academic institutions.” It plans to get feedback from Indian users to make its products relevant for the local audience and even build features and tools specifically for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also announced it would host its first Education Summit in India this month and its first Developer Day in the country later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While India is clearly an essential market for OpenAI, the company faces key challenges — including how to convert free users into paying subscribers. Like other major AI players, it must navigate the monetization hurdle in a price-sensitive South Asian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, the company introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT plan called ChatGPT Go, priced at ₹399 per month (approximately $4.75), making it the first ChatGPT plan in India to attract the masses. This came just days after arch-rival Perplexity partnered with Indian telco giant Bharti Airtel to give Airtel’s more than 360 million subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faces challenges in integrating with Indian businesses. In November, Indian news agency Asian News International (ANI) sued OpenAI for allegedly using its copyrighted news content without permission. A group of Indian publishers joined that case in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, the Indian government is actively promoting AI across its departments and aims to strengthen the country’s position on the global AI map — momentum that OpenAI hopes to leverage.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“India has all the ingredients to become a global AI leader — amazing tech talent, a world-class developer ecosystem, and strong government support through the IndiaAI Mission,” Altman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is not OpenAI’s first Asian office location. The company previously opened offices in markets including Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. OpenAI rival Anthropic also considered Japan a higher-priority market than India in the continent and recently set up its office in Tokyo rather than New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the reasons these AI companies do not prioritize India as an early market is the difficulty in securing enterprise customers, a Silicon Valley-based investor source recently told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“OpenAI’s decision to establish a presence in India reflects the country’s growing leadership in digital innovation and AI adoption,” said Indian IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, in a prepared statement. “As part of the IndiaAI Mission, we are building the ecosystem for trusted and inclusive AI, and we welcome OpenAI’s partnership in advancing this vision to ensure the benefits of AI reach every citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/openai-india.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI has announced plans to open its first office in India, just days after launching a ChatGPT plan tailored for Indian users, as it looks to tap into the country’s rapidly growing AI market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Friday, the company said it would set up a local team in India and open a corporate office in the capital, New Delhi, in the coming months. The move builds on OpenAI’s recent hiring efforts in the region. In April 2024, the company appointed former Truecaller and Meta executive Pragya Mishra as its public policy and partnerships lead in India. OpenAI also brought on former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to help facilitate discussions with the Indian government on AI policy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China — is a natural fit for OpenAI, which is competing with tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI upstarts like Perplexity, all looking to tap into the country’s massive user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that it has started hiring a local team to “focus on strengthening relationships with local partners, governments, businesses, developers, and academic institutions.” It plans to get feedback from Indian users to make its products relevant for the local audience and even build features and tools specifically for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also announced it would host its first Education Summit in India this month and its first Developer Day in the country later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While India is clearly an essential market for OpenAI, the company faces key challenges — including how to convert free users into paying subscribers. Like other major AI players, it must navigate the monetization hurdle in a price-sensitive South Asian market.&lt;/p&gt;
