Referencing the impact of DeepSeek-R1’s release earlier this year, Xu noted: “Between January and April 30, our AI R&amp;amp;D teams worked closely to make sure that the inference capabilities of our Ascend 910B and 910C chips can keep up with customer needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following customer feedback sessions, Xu stated: “Our customers have raised many issues and expectations they’ve had with Ascend. And they keep giving us great suggestions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledgement of developer pain points provided context for the comprehensive open-source commitments announced at the August 5, 2025 Ascend Computing Industry Development Summit and reinforced by Xu at Huawei Connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers who have struggled with Ascend tooling, documentation, or ecosystem maturity, the frank assessment signals awareness of gaps between the platform’s technical capabilities and its practical usability. The open-source strategy appears designed directly to address these friction points by enabling community contributions, transparency, and external improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CANN: Compiler and virtual instruction set details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most technically significant commitment involves CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks), Huawei’s foundational toolkit that sits between AI frameworks and Ascend hardware. At the August summit, Xu specified: “For CANN, we will open interfaces for the compiler and virtual instruction set, and fully open-source other software.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiered approach distinguishes between components receiving full open-source treatment versus those where Huawei will provide open interfaces with potentially proprietary implementations. The compiler and virtual instruction set – important translation layers that convert high-level code into hardware-executable instructions – will have open interfaces. This means developers can understand and potentially optimise how their code gets compiled for Ascend processors, even if the compiler implementation itself remains partially closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction matters for performance tuning. Developers need visibility into compilation processes when working on latency-sensitive applications or are trying to extract maximum efficiency from hardware. Open interfaces provide that visibility; full open-source would additionally enable replacing or modifying the compiler itself. Huawei’s approach offers transparency for optimisation yet retains some proprietary elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline remains firm: “We will go open source and open access with CANN (based on existing Ascend 910B/910C design) by December 31, 2025.” The specification of “based on existing Ascend 910B/910C design” clarifies that the open-source release will reflect current-generation hardware rather than future chip architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mind series: Application enablement kits and toolchains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the foundational CANN layer, Huawei committed to open-sourcing what developers interact with daily: “For our Mind series application enablement kits and toolchains, we will go fully open-source by December 31, 2025,” Xu said at Huawei Connect, reinforcing the commitment made at the Ascend Computing Industry Development Summit on August 5, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mind series encompasses the practical development environment – the SDKs, libraries, debugging tools, profilers, and utilities that developers use when building AI applications. Unlike CANN’s tiered approach with open interfaces for some components, the Mind series sees a blanket commitment to full open-source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the entire application layer toolchain becomes inspect-able, modifiable, and community-extensible. Debugging tools could be enhanced with needed functionality, libraries can be optimised for specific use cases, and utilities can be wrapped in more ergonomic interfaces. In short, the development ecosystem will evolve through community contributions rather than standing on vendor updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the announcement didn’t specify which tools specifically comprise the Mind series, which programming languages they support, or how comprehensive the documentation is to be. Developers evaluating whether to invest time in the platform will need to assess toolchain completeness once the December release arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OpenPangu foundation models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei has also committed to “fully open-source our openPangu foundation models.” This positions Huawei in the open-source foundation model space alongside Meta’s Llama series, Mistral AI’s offerings, and various other initiatives that lean into community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement provided no specifics about openPangu capabilities, parameter counts, training data, or licensing terms. Foundation model open-sourcing raises questions beyond licensing, and what restrictions will exist on commercial use. What datasets were used for training, and what biases or limitations does each model exhibit? Can the model be fine-tuned and redistributed? These issues have yet to be resolved, at least publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, open-source foundation models provide starting points for domain-specific applications without requiring the massive computational resources needed for training from scratch. However, model quality, licensing flexibility, and available documentation determine practical utility. The December release will reveal whether openPangu models represent competitive alternatives to established open-source options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operating system integration flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One practical implementation detail that emerged at Huawei Connect 2025 addresses a common barrier to adopting new AI infrastructure: operating system compatibility. Huawei announced that “Huawei has made the entire UB OS Component open-source, so that its code can be integrated into upstream open-source OS communities like openEuler.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration approach offers unusual flexibility. According to the announcements: “Users can integrate part or all of the UB OS Component’s source code into their existing OSes, to support independent iteration and version maintenance. Users can also embed the entire component into their existing OSes as a plug-in to ensure it can evolve in-step with open-source communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modular design means organisations running Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or other distros aren’t forced to migrate to a Huawei-specific operating systems. The UB OS Component – which handles SuperPod interconnect management at the operating system level – can be integrated into existing environments. For developers and system administrators, this lowers deployment friction significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, flexibility comes with responsibility. Organisations choosing to integrate UB OS Component source code into their own systems become responsible for testing, maintenance, and updates. Huawei is providing the component as open-source rather than as a supported product for arbitrary Linux distributions. The approach works well for organisations with strong Linux expertise; it may prove challenging for those expecting turnkey vendor support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Framework compatibility strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important factor for developer adoption is compatibility with existing AI frameworks. Rather than forcing developers to abandon familiar tools, Huawei is building integration layers. According to Huawei, it “has been prioritising support for open-source communities like PyTorch and vLLM to help developers independently innovate.” PyTorch compatibility is particularly significant given that framework’s dominance in AI research and production deployments. If developers can write standard PyTorch code that executes efficiently on Ascend hardware without extensive modifications, the barrier to experimentation drops substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations could evaluate Ascend infrastructure using minimally-tweaked existing codebases rather than requiring rewrites. The vLLM integration targets a specific high-demand use case: optimised large language model inference. As organisations deploy LLM-based applications, inference performance and cost become important factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native vLLM support suggests Huawei is addressing practical deployment concerns rather than just research capabilities. However, the announcements didn’t detail the completeness of any integration. Partial PyTorch compatibility that requires workarounds for certain operations or delivers suboptimal performance may prove more frustrating than existing alternatives. The quality of framework integrations will determine whether they genuinely lower adoption barriers or simply create new categories of compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;December 31 deadline and what follows&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 31, 2025 timeline for open-sourcing CANN, Mind series, and openPangu models is approximately three months away. The near-term deadline suggests substantial preparation work is already complete: code has been cleaned of internal dependencies, documentation is being written, licensing terms are being finalised, and repository infrastructure is being established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial release quality will largely determine community response. Open-source projects that arrive with incomplete documentation, limited examples, missing features, or immature tooling often fail to attract contributors regardless of underlying technical merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers evaluating unfamiliar platforms need comprehensive learning resources, working examples, and clear paths from “Hello World” to production deployment. The December release represents a beginning rather than a culmination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful open-source projects require sustained investment beyond initial code publication. Community management, issue triage, pull request review and merge, documentation maintenance, and roadmap coordination all demand ongoing resources. Whether Huawei commits to multi-year community support will determine whether the platform develops an active contributor base or becomes abandoned code with public repositories but minimal development activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What remains unspecified&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the specific commitments and timelines, several important details about open-source AI development on Ascend remain undefined. Licence selection will fundamentally affect how developers and organisations can use the software. Permissive licences like Apache 2.0 or MIT enable commercial use with minimal restrictions and allow proprietary derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyleft licenses like GPL require derivative works to also be open-sourced, which affects traditional models of commercial product development. Huawei hasn’t specified under which licences the December releases will be. Overall governance structures for the open-source projects are equally unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will there be an independent foundation overseeing development? Will Huawei accept external maintainers with commit privileges? How will feature priorities and roadmap decisions be made? Will there be a transparent process for accepting community contributions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance questions often determine whether projects attract genuine external participation or remain vendor-controlled initiatives with public code but limited community influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developer evaluation timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers and organisations considering investment in Huawei’s open-source AI development platform, the next three months provide time for preparation and evaluation. Organisations can assess their requirements, evaluate whether Ascend hardware specifications match their workload characteristics, and prepare teams for potential platform adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December 31 release will provide concrete materials for hands-on evaluation: actual code to review, documentation to assess, examples to test, and toolchains to experiment with. The weeks following release will reveal community response – whether external developers file issues, contribute improvements, and begin building the ecosystem resources that make platforms increasingly capable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-2026, patterns should have emerged about whether Huawei’s open-source AI development strategy is succeeding in building an active community around Ascend infrastructure or whether the platform remains primarily a vendor-led initiative with limited external participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, a six-month window from December 2025 through to around mid-2026 will be an evaluation period for determining whether this open-source platform warrants serious investment of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Inside Huawei’s plan to make thousands of AI chips think like one computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We’re excited to share that we’ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list features businesses from around the world that are building technologies to reduce emissions or address the impacts of climate change. They represent advances across a wide range of industries, from agriculture and transportation to energy and critical minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable difference about this year’s list is that we’ve focused on fewer firms—we’ll highlight 10 instead of the 15 we’ve recognized in previous years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This change reflects the times: Climate science and technology are in a dramatically different place from where they were just one year ago. The US, the world’s largest economy and historically its biggest polluter, has made a U-turn on climate policy as the Trump administration cancels hundreds of billions of dollars in grants, tax credits, and loans designed to support the industry and climate research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the stark truth is that time is of the essence. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, the UN treaty that aimed to limit global warming by setting a goal of cutting emissions so that temperatures would rise no more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial temperatures. Today, experts agree that we’ve virtually run out of time to reach that goal and will need to act fast to limit warming to less than 2 °C.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies on this year’s list are inventing and scaling technologies that could help. There’s a wide array of firms represented, from early-stage startups to multibillion-dollar businesses. Their technologies run the gamut from electric vehicles to the materials that scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, we can’t claim to be able to predict the future: Not all the businesses we’ve recognized will succeed.

This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here). We’re excited to share that we’ll publish our third edition of Climate Tech Companies to Watch on October 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list features businesses from around the world that are building technologies to reduce emissions or address the impacts of climate change. They represent advances across a wide range of industries, from agriculture and transportation to energy and critical minerals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One notable difference about this year’s list is that we’ve focused on fewer firms—we’ll highlight 10 instead of the 15 we’ve recognized in previous years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This change reflects the times: Climate science and technology are in a dramatically different place from where they were just one year ago. The US, the world’s largest economy and historically its biggest polluter, has made a U-turn on climate policy as the Trump administration cancels hundreds of billions of dollars in grants, tax credits, and loans designed to support the industry and climate research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And the stark truth is that time is of the essence. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement, the UN treaty that aimed to limit global warming by setting a goal of cutting emissions so that temperatures would rise no more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial temperatures. Today, experts agree that we’ve virtually run out of time to reach that goal and will need to act fast to limit warming to less than 2 °C.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies on this year’s list are inventing and scaling technologies that could help. There’s a wide array of firms represented, from early-stage startups to multibillion-dollar businesses. Their technologies run the gamut from electric vehicles to the materials that scaffold our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, we can’t claim to be able to predict the future: Not all the businesses we’ve recognized will succeed. But we’ve done our best to choose companies with a solid technical footing, as well as feasible plans for bringing their solutions to the right market and scaling them effectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share the list with you in just a few days.

Two former Microsoft executives view it as a problem — and they have started Maximor to replace spreadsheets with AI agents for the grunt work finance teams perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Excel spreadsheets are everywhere in finance. Even with dedicated ERP, CRM, and billing systems, many mid-sized companies and enterprises still export transactions into Excel for manual reconciliation. Teams often treat spreadsheets as makeshift databases, sometimes even relying on functions like VLOOKUP — a function used to pull matching numbers from one table into another — to line up figures across files. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor aims to replace finance teams’ reliance on Excel with its AI system, and has emerged from stealth with a $9 million seed round led by Foundation Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup uses a network of AI agents that connect directly to ERP, CRM, and billing systems to continuously pull transactions. That, co-founder and CEO Ramnandan Krishnamurthy (pictured above, right) said in an exclusive interview, helps unify operational and financial data and provide real-time financial visibility — instead of waiting until month-end to sort it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The approach should help reduce the time needed for the month-end close, he believes. For instance, Maximor says that proptech firm Rently, one of its early customers, cut its closing from eight days to four and avoided two additional accounting hires. Rently was able to redirect nearly half its team’s time to strategic work after using Maximor’s agentic platform, Rently’s CFO Dustin Neel said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor’s financial agents plug into ERPs like NetSuite and Intacct, accounting tools such as QuickBooks and Zoho Books, and a range of payroll, CRM, and other SaaS platforms. Once connected, they generate workpapers, reviewer notes, and audit trails — helping streamline audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Maximor aims to reduce reliance on Excel, it still allows teams to export reconciled data into spreadsheets — a format that many auditors and finance staff prefer before sending numbers to audit.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re interoperable with Excel on that part, as our platform does the work and can present it in our own UI or in Excel directly,” Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to its AI agents, Maximor offers human accountants as a human-in-the-loop option for its AI work, or as an accounting service for companies without in-house finance teams. It’s an interesting failsafe, given that Maximor pitches itself as an AI startup that automates this work. Relying on humans may seem at odds with that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch that the software is self-sufficient, with agents handling end-to-end work independently. The agents act as preparers and people act as reviewers, he said, adding that it works much like traditional accounting teams, where junior staff handle routine tasks and managers focus on oversight.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Krishnamurthy co-founded Maximor in the summer of 2024 after years at Microsoft as a founding member of its digital transformation group, where he led finance and data projects for Fortune 500 clients, including Coca-Cola. He teamed up with Ajay Krishna Amudan, now CTO, who previously worked on a revamp Microsoft’s internal revenue systems, among other projects there. The two have worked together for 14 years, starting as students at IIT-Madras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The duo’s finance experience at Microsoft helped attract angel investors including CFOs and finance leaders from Ramp, Gusto, MongoDB, Zuora, and the Big Four accounting firms, Krishnamurthy said. The seed round also drew Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, a former IIT-Madras classmate of Krishnamurthy, and Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo, who was introduced by the VCs backing the round. Institutional investors Gaia Ventures and Boldcap also took part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maximor, headquartered in New York with an office in Bengaluru, has 18 employees split almost evenly between the U.S. and India, and is actively hiring in both locations. The startup targets companies with at least $50 million in revenue and already counts early customers in the U.S., China, and India. Moreover, Maximor’s software supports both GAAP and IFRS standards, catering to enterprises with a global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/maximor-founders.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Despite millions spent on financial software, many finance teams still rely on Excel to close their books and reconcile numbers while preparing them for audit.

 &lt;p&gt;The need to cut emissions and adapt to our warming world is growing more urgent. This year, we’ve seen temperatures reach record highs, as they have nearly every year for the last decade. Climate-fueled natural disasters are affecting communities around the world, costing billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why, for the past two years, MIT Technology Review has curated a list of companies with the potential to make a meaningful difference in addressing climate change (you can revisit the 2024 list here).

          &lt;p&gt;The world’s top artificial intelligence groups are stepping up their focus on so-called world models that can better understand human environments, in the search for new ways to achieve machine “superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind, Meta, and Nvidia are among the companies attempting to gain ground in the AI race by developing systems that aim to navigate the physical world by learning from videos and robotic data rather than just language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This push comes as questions rise about whether large language models—the technology that powers popular chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—are reaching a ceiling in their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaps in performance between LLMs released by companies across the sector, such as OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI, have been slowing, despite the vast sums invested in their development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential market for world models could be huge, almost the size of the global economy, according to Rev Lebaredian, vice-president of Omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, as it brings the technology into the physical domain, such as the manufacturing and health care sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the opportunity for world foundation models? Essentially... $100 trillion if we can make an intelligence that can understand the physical world and operate in the physical world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World models are trained using data streams of real or simulated environments. They are viewed as an important step in pushing forward progress in self-driving cars, robotics, and so-called AI agents, but require a huge amount of data and computing power to train and are considered an unsolved technical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on an alternative approach to LLMs has become visible as several AI groups have unveiled a series of advancements in world models in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google DeepMind previewed Genie 3, which generates video frame by frame and takes past interactions into account. Previously, video generation models have typically created the entire video at once, rather than step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI... remains very much limited to the digital domain,” said Shlomi Fruchter, co-lead of Genie 3 at Google DeepMind. “By building environments that look like or behave like the real world, we can have much more scalable ways to train the AI... without the real implications of making a mistake in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta is attempting to replicate how children learn passively by observing the world around them, training its V-JEPA models on raw video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (Fair) lab, led by Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and focused on longer-term AI projects, released its second version of the model in June, which it has been testing on robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeCun, considered one of the “godfathers” of modern AI, has been one of the most vocal proponents of the new architecture, warning that LLMs would never achieve the ability to reason and plan like humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Meta’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, has recently increased investment in top AI talent, with an elite team now pushing to make breakthroughs on its next Llama LLM models. This has included hiring Alexandr Wang, the founder of data labeling group Scale AI, to head all of Meta’s AI work, with LeCun now reporting to Wang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One near-term application of world models is in the entertainment industry, where they can create interactive and realistic scenes. World Labs, a startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, is developing a model that generates video game-like 3D environments from a single image.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runway, a video generation start-up that has deals with Hollywood studios, including Lionsgate, launched a product last month that uses world models to create gaming settings, with personalized stories and characters generated in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditional video methods [are a] brute-force approach to pixel generation, where you’re trying to squeeze motion in a couple of frames to create the illusion of movement, but the model actually doesn’t really know or reason about what’s going on in that scene,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, chief executive officer at Runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous video-generation models had physics that were unlike the real world, he added, which general-purpose world model systems help to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build these models, companies need to collect a huge amount of physical data about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Niantic has mapped 10 million locations, gathering information through games including Pokémon Go, which has 30 million monthly players interacting with a global map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niantic ran Pokémon Go for nine years and, even after the game was sold to US-based Scopely in June, its players still contribute anonymized data through scans of public landmarks to help build its world model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a running start at the problem,” said John Hanke, chief executive of Niantic Spatial, as the company is now called following the Scopely deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Niantic and Nvidia are working on filling gaps by getting their world models to generate or predict environments. Nvidia’s Omniverse platform creates and runs such simulations, assisting the $4.3 trillion tech giant’s push toward robotics and building on its long history of simulating real-world environments in video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has asserted that the next major growth phase for the company will come with “physical AI,” with the new models revolutionizing the field of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some such as Meta’s LeCun have said this vision of a new generation of AI systems powering machines with human-level intelligence could take 10 years to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the potential scope of the cutting-edge technology is extensive, according to AI experts. World models “open up the opportunity to service all of these other industries and amplify the same thing that computers did for knowledge work,” said Nvidia’s Lebaredian.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The world’s top artificial intelligence groups are stepping up their focus on so-called world models that can better understand human environments, in the search for new ways to achieve machine “superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind, Meta, and Nvidia are among the companies attempting to gain ground in the AI race by developing systems that aim to navigate the physical world by learning from videos and robotic data rather than just language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This push comes as questions rise about whether large language models—the technology that powers popular chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—are reaching a ceiling in their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaps in performance between LLMs released by companies across the sector, such as OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI, have been slowing, despite the vast sums invested in their development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential market for world models could be huge, almost the size of the global economy, according to Rev Lebaredian, vice-president of Omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, as it brings the technology into the physical domain, such as the manufacturing and health care sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the opportunity for world foundation models? Essentially... $100 trillion if we can make an intelligence that can understand the physical world and operate in the physical world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World models are trained using data streams of real or simulated environments. They are viewed as an important step in pushing forward progress in self-driving cars, robotics, and so-called AI agents, but require a huge amount of data and computing power to train and are considered an unsolved technical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on an alternative approach to LLMs has become visible as several AI groups have unveiled a series of advancements in world models in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google DeepMind previewed Genie 3, which generates video frame by frame and takes past interactions into account. Previously, video generation models have typically created the entire video at once, rather than step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI... remains very much limited to the digital domain,” said Shlomi Fruchter, co-lead of Genie 3 at Google DeepMind. “By building environments that look like or behave like the real world, we can have much more scalable ways to train the AI... without the real implications of making a mistake in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta is attempting to replicate how children learn passively by observing the world around them, training its V-JEPA models on raw video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (Fair) lab, led by Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and focused on longer-term AI projects, released its second version of the model in June, which it has been testing on robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeCun, considered one of the “godfathers” of modern AI, has been one of the most vocal proponents of the new architecture, warning that LLMs would never achieve the ability to reason and plan like humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Meta’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, has recently increased investment in top AI talent, with an elite team now pushing to make breakthroughs on its next Llama LLM models. This has included hiring Alexandr Wang, the founder of data labeling group Scale AI, to head all of Meta’s AI work, with LeCun now reporting to Wang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One near-term application of world models is in the entertainment industry, where they can create interactive and realistic scenes. World Labs, a startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, is developing a model that generates video game-like 3D environments from a single image.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runway, a video generation start-up that has deals with Hollywood studios, including Lionsgate, launched a product last month that uses world models to create gaming settings, with personalized stories and characters generated in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditional video methods [are a] brute-force approach to pixel generation, where you’re trying to squeeze motion in a couple of frames to create the illusion of movement, but the model actually doesn’t really know or reason about what’s going on in that scene,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, chief executive officer at Runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous video-generation models had physics that were unlike the real world, he added, which general-purpose world model systems help to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build these models, companies need to collect a huge amount of physical data about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Niantic has mapped 10 million locations, gathering information through games including Pokémon Go, which has 30 million monthly players interacting with a global map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niantic ran Pokémon Go for nine years and, even after the game was sold to US-based Scopely in June, its players still contribute anonymized data through scans of public landmarks to help build its world model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a running start at the problem,” said John Hanke, chief executive of Niantic Spatial, as the company is now called following the Scopely deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Niantic and Nvidia are working on filling gaps by getting their world models to generate or predict environments. Nvidia’s Omniverse platform creates and runs such simulations, assisting the $4.3 trillion tech giant’s push toward robotics and building on its long history of simulating real-world environments in video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has asserted that the next major growth phase for the company will come with “physical AI,” with the new models revolutionizing the field of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some such as Meta’s LeCun have said this vision of a new generation of AI systems powering machines with human-level intelligence could take 10 years to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the potential scope of the cutting-edge technology is extensive, according to AI experts. World models “open up the opportunity to service all of these other industries and amplify the same thing that computers did for knowledge work,” said Nvidia’s Lebaredian.&lt;/p&gt;

Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had an &lt;em&gt;a-ha&lt;/em&gt; moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they’re five years old,” Tomy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of ComplexChaos, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved climate negotiations, but it really doesn’t matter what the issue is. Their goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Facilitating cooperation isn’t something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the Habermas Machine, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both by majority and minority point of view,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup’s tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google’s Habermas Machine and OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The goal, Ben Dror said, is to help the delegates arrive at consensus as a bloc before they begin negotiations with others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Ideally, the tool would help speed things during negotiations, too. When blocs, or delegates from groups of aligned countries, encounter new information in the process of a large negotiating session, they often need to regroup to process the new information. “Blocs are usually the reason why negotiations have to stop. The bloc has to come out, renegotiate, reposition, and then go back in. And that creates a lot of friction,” Ben Dror said. ComplexChaos hopes that its tool can help shorten that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the trial with the delegates from African countries, ComplexChaos said that participants reported up to a 60% reduction in the time it took to coordinate, and that 91% of participants said that the AI tool helped them see perspectives they would have otherwise missed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ComplexChaos is also pitching its cooperation tool to companies, including tech companies and large consultancies. “Strategic planning by AI is basically the same problem,” Lorsch said. “The annual strategic planning process of most companies takes about three months of the year with back and forth negotiations, multi-layer, across time zones, across teams, and so on and so forth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Lorsch and Ben Dror are most enthusiastic when talking about climate negotiations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If AI can shorten these processes, simplify them, then we’d be so much better off. Not just for climate, for anything sustainability, for any big challenge that we’re facing,” Ben Dror said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gettyimages-155142663.jpg?resize=1200,772" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Making democracy work isn’t easy, as recent events have made clear. Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I had an &lt;em&gt;a-ha&lt;/em&gt; moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they’re five years old,” Tomy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of ComplexChaos, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved climate negotiations, but it really doesn’t matter what the issue is. Their goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Facilitating cooperation isn’t something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the Habermas Machine, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both by majority and minority point of view,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup’s tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google’s Habermas Machine and OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The safety features come in response to numerous incidents of certain ChatGPT models validating users’ delusional thinking instead of redirecting harmful conversations.&amp;nbsp;OpenAI is facing a&amp;nbsp;wrongful death lawsuit&amp;nbsp;tied&amp;nbsp;to one such incident,&amp;nbsp;after&amp;nbsp;a teenage boy died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The routing system is designed to&amp;nbsp;detect emotionally sensitive conversations and&amp;nbsp;automatically switch mid-chat to GPT-5-thinking, which the company sees as the best equipped model for high-stakes safety work. In particular, the GPT-5 models were trained with a new safety feature that OpenAI calls “safe completions,” which allows them to answer sensitive questions in a safe way, rather than simply refusing to engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a contrast from the company’s previous chat models, which are designed to be agreeable and answer questions quickly. GPT-4o has come under particular scrutiny because of its overly sycophantic, agreeable nature, which has both fueled incidents of&amp;nbsp;AI-induced&amp;nbsp;delusions and drawn a large base of devoted users.&amp;nbsp;When OpenAI rolled out&amp;nbsp;GPT-5 as the default&amp;nbsp;in August, many users&amp;nbsp;pushed back&amp;nbsp;and demanded access to GPT-4o.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While many experts and users have welcomed the safety features, others have&amp;nbsp;criticized&amp;nbsp;what they see as an overly cautious implementation, with some users&amp;nbsp;accusing OpenAI of treating adults like children in a way that degrades the quality of the service.&amp;nbsp;OpenAI has suggested that getting it right will take&amp;nbsp;time and&amp;nbsp;has given itself&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;120-day period of iteration and improvement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nick Turley, VP and head of the ChatGPT app, acknowledged some of the “strong reactions to 4o responses” due to the implementation of the router&amp;nbsp;with explanations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis,”&amp;nbsp;Turley posted on X. “ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked. This is part of a broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The implementation of parental controls in ChatGPT received similar levels of praise and scorn, with some commending giving parents a way to keep tabs on their children’s AI use, and others fearful that it opens the door to OpenAI treating adults like children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The controls let parents customize their teen’s experience by setting quiet hours, turning off voice mode and memory, removing image generation, and opting out of model training. Teen accounts will also get additional&amp;nbsp;content protections&amp;nbsp;— like reduced graphic content and extreme beauty ideals&amp;nbsp;— and a detection system that recognizes potential signs that a teen might be thinking about self-harm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,” per OpenAI’s&amp;nbsp;blog. “If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text&amp;nbsp;message&amp;nbsp;and push alert on&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;phone, unless they have opted out.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI acknowledged that the system&amp;nbsp;won’t&amp;nbsp;be perfect and may sometimes raise alarms when there&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;real danger, “but we think it’s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent.” The AI firm said it is also working on ways to reach law enforcement or emergency services if&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;detects&amp;nbsp;an imminent threat to life and&amp;nbsp;cannot&amp;nbsp;reach a parent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195918462.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI began testing a new&amp;nbsp;safety routing&amp;nbsp;system&amp;nbsp;in ChatGPT&amp;nbsp;over the weekend, and&amp;nbsp;on Monday introduced parental controls to the chatbot —&amp;nbsp;drawing mixed reactions from users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The safety features come in response to numerous incidents of certain ChatGPT models validating users’ delusional thinking instead of redirecting harmful conversations.&amp;nbsp;OpenAI is facing a&amp;nbsp;wrongful death lawsuit&amp;nbsp;tied&amp;nbsp;to one such incident,&amp;nbsp;after&amp;nbsp;a teenage boy died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire Lord of The Rings series) and $15 per million output tokens.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last year, Anthropic’s AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI’s GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic’s dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5’s performance on benchmarks alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3051688" height="384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-29-at-10.08.34AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;(Credit: Anthropic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hershey says he’s seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a statement shared with TechCrunch Cursor CEO Micheal Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude’s susceptibility to prompt injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Alongside the launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is also launching the Claude Agent SDK. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, and can be used to help developers build their own agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly. The company says the model will respond to user requests in real time, with no predetermined functionality or prewritten code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The tense competition in the AI world has made it common for companies to ship flagship models every few months. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is launching less than two months after Anthropic’s last AI model, Claude Opus 4.1.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July, Swedish vibe coding startup Lovable hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just eight months after launch, plans to close the year at $250 million ARR and thinks it will hit $1 billion ARR within the next 12 months. Meanwhile, Replit said earlier this month that its ARR soared from&amp;nbsp;$2.8 million&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;$150 million&amp;nbsp;in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These companies’ remarkable growth has fueled a wave of competitors, many of which are also quickly gaining momentum. “This is one of those spaces where every company is growing like a weed,” said Nikhil Trivedi, co-founder and general partner at VC firm Footwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, despite their rapid growth, Trivedi argues that Lovable, Replit, and other vibe coding startups have a significant shortcoming: they excel at developing prototypes but struggle to enable users to launch production-ready software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The problem with most vibe coding companies, Trivedi says, is that they don’t provide all the infrastructure that non-technical users need to launch a functional product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anything, an AI app launched a month ago, is attempting to solve this problem by offering all the tools – from databases to storage and payment functionality — that users need to run businesses on the web or to send their vibe-coded creations to the App Store. The company’s initial traction was explosive, reaching $2 million annualized run rate in just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though the vibe coding market is crowded, the company’s growth rate is so impressive that Trivedi knew he had to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anything announced on Monday that it has raised an $11 million financing round at a $100 million valuation, led by Footwork, with additional backing from Uncork, Bessemer, and M13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founded by former Google colleagues Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe, Anything is particularly designed to help non-technical people generate complete web and mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You haven’t really seen real businesses built on top of any of these tools,” Amin said about other vibe coding companies. “We want to be the Shopify of the space, where people build apps that make money on top of us.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amin claims that users have already leveraged Anything to build fully functional applications available in the AppStore, including a habit tracker, a CPR training course, and a hair-style “try-on” app. Some of these apps are even starting to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These users, according to Amin, can finish their app in large part because they don’t have to figure out how to set up and connect other essential tools to the prototype generated by the vibe coding app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea of developing a soup-to-nuts AI-assisted app builder came to Amin and Lowe a little under a year ago. The duo has been working together since 2021. Their first offering was a bootstrapped development marketplace that used AI coding tools in conjunction with human developers. But this was before the rise of LLMs. That business was generating about $2 million in annualized run rate, but it became clear that generative AI could soon deliver apps faster and at lower costs than their marketplace model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, in 2023, they shut down that business and started working on developing an AI-powered app-building tool. They even raised some pre-seed and seed funding from Uncork and Bessemer Venture Partners along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amin and Lowe noticed that most competitive tools, including Lovable and StackBlitz’s Bolt, rely on the third-party database Supabase. They believed that they could differentiate Anything AI by building all the infrastructure in-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That development took time, but it may turn out to be worth the effort because Anything is not the only startup in this market. It’s not even the only one that’s making a bet that offering all the backend tools can be a big growth driver. Other startups that are building big chunks of their own infrastructure include Mocha and Rork, the latter a company that claims to be on track to hit $10 million in ARR by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the intense competition doesn’t faze Trivedi. “It seems there’s enough demand out there for different types of app building products,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dhruv_marcus.png?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It’s no secret that vibe coding — using AI-powered coding tools to build apps and websites via natural language prompts — is exploding in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anything announced on Monday that it has raised an $11 million financing round at a $100 million valuation, led by Footwork, with additional backing from Uncork, Bessemer, and M13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Co-founded by former Google colleagues Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe, Anything is particularly designed to help non-technical people generate complete web and mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You haven’t really seen real businesses built on top of any of these tools,” Amin said about other vibe coding companies. “We want to be the Shopify of the space, where people build apps that make money on top of us.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amin claims that users have already leveraged Anything to build fully functional applications available in the AppStore, including a habit tracker, a CPR training course, and a hair-style “try-on” app. Some of these apps are even starting to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These users, according to Amin, can finish their app in large part because they don’t have to figure out how to set up and connect other essential tools to the prototype generated by the vibe coding app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The idea of developing a soup-to-nuts AI-assisted app builder came to Amin and Lowe a little under a year ago. The duo has been working together since 2021. Their first offering was a bootstrapped development marketplace that used AI coding tools in conjunction with human developers. But this was before the rise of LLMs. That business was generating about $2 million in annualized run rate, but it became clear that generative AI could soon deliver apps faster and at lower costs than their marketplace model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, in 2023, they shut down that business and started working on developing an AI-powered app-building tool. They even raised some pre-seed and seed funding from Uncork and Bessemer Venture Partners along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Amin and Lowe noticed that most competitive tools, including Lovable and StackBlitz’s Bolt, rely on the third-party database Supabase. They believed that they could differentiate Anything AI by building all the infrastructure in-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That development took time, but it may turn out to be worth the effort because Anything is not the only startup in this market. It’s not even the only one that’s making a bet that offering all the backend tools can be a big growth driver. Other startups that are building big chunks of their own infrastructure include Mocha and Rork, the latter a company that claims to be on track to hit $10 million in ARR by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But the intense competition doesn’t faze Trivedi. “It seems there’s enough demand out there for different types of app building products,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:55:29 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
