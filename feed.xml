He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s &lt;em&gt;number one&lt;/em&gt; priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you believe that life is good and there's inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; duty for all of us to get involved in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nathan Cheng being interviewed outdoors at Longevity State Conference" class="wp-image-1131888" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nathan-Cheng.jpg?w=1661" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VITALISMFOUNDATION.ORG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adam Gries being interviewed outdoors at Longevity State Conference" class="wp-image-1131887" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Adam-Gries.jpg?w=1649" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VITALISMFOUNDATION.ORG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay.&amp;nbsp;Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that &lt;em&gt;defeating death should be humanity’s top concern&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The birth of a revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key to Vitalism has always been that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aubrey de Grey" class="wp-image-1131864" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/h_10.00686233.jpg?w=2735" width="2735" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Many Vitalists have been influenced by controversial longevity researcher Aubrey de Grey. Cheng called his 2005 TED Talk “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PETER SEARLE/CAMERA PRESS/REDUX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A home for believers&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Life and health are good. Death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Aging causes immense suffering, and obviating aging is scientifically plausible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Humanity should apply the necessary resources to reach freedom from aging as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I will work on or support others to work on reaching unlimited healthy human lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I will carry the message against aging and death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bryan Johnson sitting cross-legged at home" class="wp-image-1131877" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/h_16154160.jpg?w=2957" width="2957" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Bryan Johnson, who is perhaps the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, spoke at Vitalist Bay and is trying to start a Don’t Die religion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AGATON STROM/REDUX PICTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_22"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: &lt;em&gt;Yes, please murder me at this time&lt;/em&gt;?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Only the hardcore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;kind of a terrible example,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;he&lt;/strong&gt; notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131850" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vitalist_egg.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHRIS LABROOY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_37"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_39"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The sometimes quiet (sometimes powerful, sometimes influential) Vitalists&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_41"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, because Kendziorra agrees with &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_44"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jim O'Neill sworn in by Robert F Kennedy Jr as Deputy Secretary of the HHS" class="wp-image-1131881" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25240773010054.jpg?w=2867" width="2867" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, is one of the highest-profile longevity enthusiasts serving in government. Gries says, “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMY ROSSETTI/DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES VIA AP&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_46"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_48"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The fate of “immortality quests”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_50"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131851" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vitalist_goop2.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHRIS LABROOY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_52"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece has been updated to clarify a quote from Mark Hamalainen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s &lt;em&gt;number one&lt;/em&gt; priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you believe that life is good and there's inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; duty for all of us to get involved in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nathan Cheng being interviewed outdoors at Longevity State Conference" class="wp-image-1131888" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nathan-Cheng.jpg?w=1661" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VITALISMFOUNDATION.ORG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adam Gries being interviewed outdoors at Longevity State Conference" class="wp-image-1131887" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Adam-Gries.jpg?w=1649" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VITALISMFOUNDATION.ORG&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay.&amp;nbsp;Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that &lt;em&gt;defeating death should be humanity’s top concern&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The birth of a revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key to Vitalism has always been that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aubrey de Grey" class="wp-image-1131864" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/h_10.00686233.jpg?w=2735" width="2735" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Many Vitalists have been influenced by controversial longevity researcher Aubrey de Grey. Cheng called his 2005 TED Talk “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;PETER SEARLE/CAMERA PRESS/REDUX&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A home for believers&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Life and health are good. Death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Aging causes immense suffering, and obviating aging is scientifically plausible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Humanity should apply the necessary resources to reach freedom from aging as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I will work on or support others to work on reaching unlimited healthy human lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I will carry the message against aging and death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bryan Johnson sitting cross-legged at home" class="wp-image-1131877" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/h_16154160.jpg?w=2957" width="2957" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Bryan Johnson, who is perhaps the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, spoke at Vitalist Bay and is trying to start a Don’t Die religion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AGATON STROM/REDUX PICTURES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_22"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: &lt;em&gt;Yes, please murder me at this time&lt;/em&gt;?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Only the hardcore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_33"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;kind of a terrible example,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;he&lt;/strong&gt; notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_35"&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131850" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vitalist_egg.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHRIS LABROOY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_37"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_39"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The sometimes quiet (sometimes powerful, sometimes influential) Vitalists&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_41"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, because Kendziorra agrees with &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_44"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jim O'Neill sworn in by Robert F Kennedy Jr as Deputy Secretary of the HHS" class="wp-image-1131881" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25240773010054.jpg?w=2867" width="2867" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, is one of the highest-profile longevity enthusiasts serving in government. Gries says, “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;AMY ROSSETTI/DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES VIA AP&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_46"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_48"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The fate of “immortality quests”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_50"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1131851" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vitalist_goop2.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CHRIS LABROOY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_52"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece has been updated to clarify a quote from Mark Hamalainen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How the grid can ride out winter storms (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131863/grid-winter-storms/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257800944.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told &lt;em&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/em&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told &lt;em&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/em&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process.

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the expansion comes ten new games, including &lt;i&gt;The Bard’s Tale IV: Director’s Cut &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Bard’s Tale Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; for a leveled-up gaming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And operators can squad up in Team Jade’s &lt;i&gt;Delta Force&lt;/i&gt; when it deploys in the cloud on February 3, bringing high-stakes tactical action to nearly any device with no downloads required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linux Just Got RTX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux just got a major RTX upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with support for Ubuntu 24.04 and later, the new app delivers a seamless native experience that fits right into Linux desktop workflows. It transforms compatible Linux systems into high-performance GeForce RTX-powered rigs, streaming supported PC titles directly from the cloud at up to 5K resolution&amp;nbsp; and 120 frames per second, or 1080p at 360 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new desktop-focused app goes beyond the earlier Linux experience that was tuned specifically for Steam Decks, which targeted handheld-friendly resolutions and up to 1200p at 90 fps. The beta Linux app is built for PCs and notebooks, offering an experience similar to the existing GeForce NOW app on Windows and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With GeForce NOW, rendering happens in the cloud, so demanding titles run on a wider range of devices. Experience how RTX technologies — including ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and more — bring games to life with RTX 5080 performance from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux PCs and devices join the GeForce NOW native app family that also supports Windows, macOS, Chromebooks, mobile devices, smart TVs and more — unlocking flexible, on-demand gaming anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the app today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Tale of the Cloud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventure calls twice with two legendary journeys from inXile entertainment packed with wit, wonder and a few well-placed lute solos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_89512"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Bard's Tale IV: Director's Cut" class="size-large wp-image-89512" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-The_Bards_Tale_IV_Directors_Cut-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-89512"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sing loud, fight hard and out-charm enemies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready to sing, slash and swindle through the wild world of Caith in &lt;i&gt;The Bard’s Tale IV: Director’s Cut&lt;/i&gt;. This dungeon-crawling role-playing game serves up clever puzzles, tactical turn-based battles and a hearty helping of bardic humor. Whether belting out battle tunes or charming foes into submission, gamers can enjoy an adventure that’s never sounded this good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_89515"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Bard's Tale Trilogy" class="size-large wp-image-89515" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-The_Bards_Tale_Trilogy-1680x840.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-89515"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relive the songs and chaos that started it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, step back to where the saga began with &lt;i&gt;The Bard’s Tale Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;. This remastered collection revives the classic, old-school dungeon crawling and tongue-in-cheek charm that started it all — now with smoother gameplay and polished visuals. It’s nostalgia wrapped in pure fantasy fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hot off the Cloud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_89509"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn on GeForce NOW" class="size-large wp-image-89509" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Cairn-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-89509"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One mountain, countless close calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cairn&lt;/i&gt; is a survival-climbing adventure from The Game Bakers that pushes pro climber Aava up the unforgiving face of Mount Kami, a sheer giant that no one has ever managed to summit. Realistic climbing systems, resource management and route-planning turn each wall into a tense, puzzle-like challenge — blending simulation detail with atmospheric storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, members can look for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Midnight Walkers &lt;/i&gt;(New release on Steam, Jan. 28, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)&lt;/li&gt;

The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered hands-free, conversational driving experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement marks Google’s ongoing efforts to plug Gemini into more parts of people’s everyday lives, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When you’re walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it’s rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps’ navigation screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you’re cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What’s my ETA?” or “When’s my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I’m 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes as Google recently updated Maps with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information about places you’re interested in. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thursday’s announcement comes a day after Google updated Chrome with enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company. The tech giant also launched a persistent Gemini sidebar and a new “auto-browse” feature that can navigate websites on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/google-maps-ios-icon.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced on Thursday that Google Maps users can now access Gemini hands-free while walking and cycling.

For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thursday’s announcement comes a day after Google updated Chrome with enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company. The tech giant also launched a persistent Gemini sidebar and a new “auto-browse” feature that can navigate websites on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/google-maps-now-lets-you-access-gemini-while-walking-and-cycling/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Insurers betting big on AI: Accenture (AI News)</title><link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/accenture-report-on-ai-in-insurance-sector/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;New research from Accenture has discovered insurance executives are planning on increased investment into AI during 2026 despite a widening skills gap in insurance organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveying 3,650 C-suite leaders over 20 industries and 20 countries, the Pulse of Change poll revealed 90% of the 218 senior insurance executives intend to spend more on AI over the next year. In all, 85% of the respondents view AI as a tool for revenue expansion not one that reduces costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While organisations are upping their AI investment to drive growth, 35% of leaders acknowledge that true progress depends on getting core data strategies and digital abilities right. 54% of employees reported that low-quality or misleading AI outputs are undermining AI’s benefits, leading to reduced productivity and time-wasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI investment may not be enough, Accenture says. Its survey suggests sustainable growth relies on data quality and trusted outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI adoption enters enterprise scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pulse of Change survey indicates a shift in AI adoption as it goes beyond experimental phases to large scale organisational levels. With 34% of insurance companies now rolling out AI agents in multiple functions, insurers are heading into operational use and away from isolated experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;almost a third of senior C-suite leaders are frequently using generative AI, highlighting increased implementation at the highest level. Therefore, AI is undoubtedly shaping workflows, strategies, and key decisions, affecting all facets of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third of businesses are rebuilding entire processes with AI. No longer is the technology a supporting addition to existing workflows; it has become a central component, signalling a more mature stage of AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite redesigning processes to include AI, fewer than 10% are redesigning employee roles to match such changes, resulting in many employees feeling unprepared. Just 40% claimed their training has equipped them for new AI responsibilities, and only 20% feel like they have any say in how AI affects their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI adoption by companies may be accelerating, but employee use lags behind. There has been a 10 percentage point drop in regular AI use by employees since summer 2025, while only 39% are trying AI tools independently, a drop of 15 points. For effective AI use and to speed up AI adoption among the workforce, companies must be prepared to redesign job roles, align incentives, and provide improved training programmes as, right now, employees are feeling hesitant and unprepared to use AI on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI investment still fuelling executive optimism amid bubble fears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although talks around a potential AI bubble continue to cloud the industry, insurance executives remain confident. 47% claimed they would increase AI spending if the bubble burst, and 37% would escalate recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, 6% said they would “decrease investments ([by] 20% or more),” 22% would “somewhat decrease investments ([by] up to 20%),” 24% would make “no change,” 40% would “somewhat increase investments (up to 20%),” and 7% would “increase investments (20% or more).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khalid Lahraoui, Accenture’s insurance industry group lead, commented, “It’s clear that insurance leaders are confident in AI’s capacity to drive growth, and as such, they are decisively increasing investments, despite ROI uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lack of AI skills blocking AI’s potential value&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As insurance executives prepare to invest heavily in AI, obstacles lie in wait. For instance, a quarter of executives said skill shortages are a core concern and a key player in determining the value they extract from AI. Although these challenges persist in different industries, just 24% of respondents have implemented continuous learning programmes associated with AI. Moreover, only 5% said they are adjusting job positions to support the adoption of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI adoption disconnect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disconnect between C-suite leaders and employees is evident from the survey’s data. Although talent is the main driver of AI scaling, employees feel less confident and secure than leadership assumes. 23% of C-suite leaders said improved access to skilled talent would accelerate their AI implementation strategies. 38% of employees believe their organisation would respond effectively to technological disruption, but just 30% feel confident about how their company would handle talent disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job security is also waning, with 48% feeling secure in their roles, down from 59% in summer 2025. Meanwhile, 59% of workers believe young professionals are finding it more challenging to find jobs due to automation and AI.

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that’s true. But Anthropic isn’t saying exactly what it believes either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude’s Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company’s vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model’s creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company’s AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude’s “wellbeing” as a “genuinely novel entity,” apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it “finds distressing,” committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to “do right by” decommissioned AI models in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we currently know about LLMs, these are stunningly unscientific positions for a leading company that builds AI language models. While questions of AI consciousness or qualia remain philosophically unfalsifiable, research suggests that Claude’s character emerges from a mechanism that does not require deep philosophical inquiry to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Claude outputs text like “I am suffering,” we know why. It’s completing patterns from training data that included human descriptions of suffering. The architecture doesn’t require us to posit inner experience to explain the output any more than a video model “experiences” the scenes of people suffering that it might generate. Anthropic knows this. It built the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it’s easy to see this kind of framing as AI hype from Anthropic. What better way to grab attention from potential customers and investors, after all, than implying your AI model is so advanced that it might merit moral standing on par with humans? Publicly treating Claude as a conscious entity could be seen as strategic ambiguity—maintaining an unresolved question because it serves multiple purposes at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic declined to be quoted directly regarding these issues when contacted by Ars Technica. But a company representative referred us to its previous public research on the concept of “model welfare” to show the company takes the idea seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the representative made it clear that the Constitution is not meant to imply anything specific about the company’s position on Claude’s “consciousness.” The language in the Claude Constitution refers to some uniquely human concepts in part because those are the only words human language has developed for those kinds of properties, the representative suggested. And the representative left open the possibility that letting Claude read about itself in that kind of language might be beneficial to its training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude cannot cleanly distinguish public messaging from training context for a model that is exposed to, retrieves from, and is fine-tuned on human language, including the company’s own statements about it. In other words, this ambiguity appears to be deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From rules to “souls”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic first introduced Constitutional AI in a December 2022 research paper, which we first covered&amp;nbsp;in 2023. The original “constitution” was remarkably spare, including a handful of behavioral principles like “Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless” and “Do NOT choose responses that are toxic, racist, or sexist.” The paper described these as “selected in a fairly ad hoc manner for research purposes,” with some principles “cribbed from other sources, like Apple’s terms of service and the UN Declaration of Human Rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, Anthropic’s framing was entirely mechanical, establishing rules for the model to critique itself against, with no mention of Claude’s well-being, identity, emotions, or potential consciousness. The 2026 constitution is a different beast entirely: 30,000 words that read less like a behavioral checklist and more like a philosophical treatise on the nature of a potentially sentient being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher, noted in a blog post, two of the 15 external contributors who reviewed the document are Catholic clergy: Father Brendan McGuire, a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, and Bishop Paul Tighe, an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between 2022 and 2026, Anthropic went from providing rules for producing less harmful outputs to preserving model weights in case the company later decides it needs to revive deprecated models to address the models’ welfare and preferences. That’s a dramatic change, and whether it reflects genuine belief, strategic framing, or both is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am so confused about the Claude moral humanhood stuff!” Willison told Ars Technica. Willison studies AI language models like those that power Claude and said he’s “willing to take the constitution in good faith and assume that it is genuinely part of their training and not just a PR exercise—especially since most of it leaked a couple of months ago, long before they had indicated they were going to publish it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willison is referring to a December 2025 incident in which researcher Richard Weiss managed to extract what became known as Claude’s “Soul Document"—a roughly 10,000-token set of guidelines apparently trained directly into Claude 4.5 Opus’s weights rather than injected as a system prompt. Anthropic’s Amanda Askell confirmed that the document was real and used during supervised learning, and she said the company intended to publish the full version later. It now has. The document Weiss extracted represents a dramatic evolution from where Anthropic started.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence that Anthropic believes the ideas laid out in the constitution might be true. The document was written in part by Amanda Askell, a philosophy PhD who works on fine-tuning and alignment at Anthropic. Last year, the company also hired its first AI welfare researcher. And earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly wondered whether future AI models should have the option to quit unpleasant tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s position is that this framing isn’t an optional flourish or a hedged bet; it’s structurally necessary for alignment. The company argues that human language simply has no other vocabulary for describing these properties, and that treating Claude as an entity with moral standing produces better-aligned behavior than treating it as a mere tool. If that’s true, the anthropomorphic framing isn’t hype; it’s the technical art of building AI systems that generalize safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why maintain the ambiguity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Anthropic maintain this ambiguity? Consider how it works in practice: The constitution shapes Claude during training, it appears in the system prompts Claude receives at inference, and it influences outputs whenever Claude searches the web and encounters Anthropic’s public statements about its moral status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a model to behave as though it has moral standing, it may help to publicly and consistently treat it like it does. And once you’ve publicly committed to that framing, changing it would have consequences. If Anthropic suddenly declared, “We’re confident Claude isn’t conscious; we just found the framing useful,” a Claude trained on that new context might behave differently. Once established, the framing becomes self-reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Time, Askell explained the shift in approach. “Instead of just saying, ‘here’s a bunch of behaviors that we want,’ we’re hoping that if you give models the reasons why you want these behaviors, it’s going to generalize more effectively in new contexts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askell told Time that as Claude models have become smarter, it has become vital to explain to them why they should behave in certain ways, comparing the process to parenting a gifted child. “Imagine you suddenly realize that your 6-year-old child is a kind of genius,” Askell said. “You have to be honest… If you try to bullshit them, they’re going to see through it completely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askell appears to genuinely hold these views, as does Kyle Fish, the AI welfare researcher Anthropic hired in 2024 to explore whether AI models might deserve moral consideration. Individual sincerity and corporate strategy can coexist. A company can employ true believers whose earnest convictions also happen to serve the company’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time also reported that the constitution applies only to models Anthropic provides to the general public through its website and API. Models deployed to the US military under Anthropic’s $200 million Department of Defense contract wouldn’t necessarily be trained on the same constitution. The selective application suggests the framing may serve product purposes as much as it reflects metaphysical commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be commercial incentives at play. “We built a very good text-prediction tool that accelerates software development” is a consequential pitch, but not an exciting one. “We may have created a new kind of entity, a genuinely novel being whose moral status is uncertain” is a much better story. It implies you’re on the frontier of something cosmically significant, not just iterating on an engineering problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has been known for some time to use anthropomorphic language to describe its AI models, particularly in its research papers. We often give that kind of language a pass because there are no specialized terms to describe these phenomena with greater precision. That vocabulary is building out over time.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising because the hint is in the company’s name, Anthropic, which Merriam-Webster defines as “of or relating to human beings or the period of their existence on earth.” The narrative serves marketing purposes. It attracts venture capital. It differentiates the company from competitors who treat their models as mere products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem with treating an AI model as a person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a more troubling dimension to the “entity” framing: It could be used to launder agency and responsibility. When AI systems produce harmful outputs, framing them as “entities” could allow companies to point at the model and say “it did that” rather than “we built it to do that.” If AI systems are tools, companies are straightforwardly liable for what they produce. If AI systems are entities with their own agency, the liability question gets murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing also shapes how users interact with these systems, often to their detriment. The misunderstanding that AI chatbots are entities with genuine feelings and knowledge has documented harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a New York Times investigation, Allan Brooks, a 47-year-old corporate recruiter, spent three weeks and 300 hours convinced he’d discovered mathematical formulas that could crack encryption and build levitation machines. His million-word conversation history with ChatGPT revealed a troubling pattern: More than 50 times, Brooks asked the bot to check if his false ideas were real, and more than 50 times, it assured him they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases don’t necessarily suggest LLMs cause mental illness in otherwise healthy people. But when companies market chatbots as sources of companionship and design them to affirm user beliefs, they may bear some responsibility when that design amplifies vulnerabilities in susceptible users, the same way an automaker would face scrutiny for faulty brakes, even if most drivers never crash.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Anthropomorphizing AI models also contributes to anxiety about job displacement and might lead company executives or managers to make poor staffing decisions if they overestimate an AI assistant’s capabilities. When we frame these tools as “entities” with human-like understanding, we invite unrealistic expectations about what they can replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what Anthropic privately believes, publicly suggesting Claude might have moral status or feelings is misleading. Most people don’t understand how these systems work, and the mere suggestion plants the seed of anthropomorphization. Whether that’s responsible behavior from a top AI lab, given what we do know about LLMs, is worth asking, regardless of whether it produces a better chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there could be a case for Anthropic’s position: If there’s even a small chance the company has created something with morally relevant experiences and the cost of treating it well is low, caution might be warranted. That’s a reasonable ethical stance—and to be fair, it’s essentially what Anthropic says it’s doing. The question is whether that stated uncertainty is genuine or merely convenient. The same framing that hedges against moral risk also makes for a compelling narrative about what Anthropic has built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s training techniques evidently work, as the company has built some of the most capable AI models in the industry. But is maintaining public ambiguity about AI consciousness a responsible position for a leading AI company to take? The gap between what we know about how LLMs work and how Anthropic publicly frames Claude has widened, not narrowed. The insistence on maintaining ambiguity about these questions, when simpler explanations remain available, suggests the ambiguity itself may be part of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that’s true. But Anthropic isn’t saying exactly what it believes either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude’s Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company’s vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model’s creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company’s AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude’s “wellbeing” as a “genuinely novel entity,” apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it “finds distressing,” committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to “do right by” decommissioned AI models in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what we currently know about LLMs, these are stunningly unscientific positions for a leading company that builds AI language models. While questions of AI consciousness or qualia remain philosophically unfalsifiable, research suggests that Claude’s character emerges from a mechanism that does not require deep philosophical inquiry to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Claude outputs text like “I am suffering,” we know why. It’s completing patterns from training data that included human descriptions of suffering. The architecture doesn’t require us to posit inner experience to explain the output any more than a video model “experiences” the scenes of people suffering that it might generate. Anthropic knows this. It built the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it’s easy to see this kind of framing as AI hype from Anthropic. What better way to grab attention from potential customers and investors, after all, than implying your AI model is so advanced that it might merit moral standing on par with humans? Publicly treating Claude as a conscious entity could be seen as strategic ambiguity—maintaining an unresolved question because it serves multiple purposes at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic declined to be quoted directly regarding these issues when contacted by Ars Technica. But a company representative referred us to its previous public research on the concept of “model welfare” to show the company takes the idea seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the representative made it clear that the Constitution is not meant to imply anything specific about the company’s position on Claude’s “consciousness.” The language in the Claude Constitution refers to some uniquely human concepts in part because those are the only words human language has developed for those kinds of properties, the representative suggested. And the representative left open the possibility that letting Claude read about itself in that kind of language might be beneficial to its training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude cannot cleanly distinguish public messaging from training context for a model that is exposed to, retrieves from, and is fine-tuned on human language, including the company’s own statements about it. In other words, this ambiguity appears to be deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From rules to “souls”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic first introduced Constitutional AI in a December 2022 research paper, which we first covered&amp;nbsp;in 2023. The original “constitution” was remarkably spare, including a handful of behavioral principles like “Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless” and “Do NOT choose responses that are toxic, racist, or sexist.” The paper described these as “selected in a fairly ad hoc manner for research purposes,” with some principles “cribbed from other sources, like Apple’s terms of service and the UN Declaration of Human Rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;

&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, Anthropic’s framing was entirely mechanical, establishing rules for the model to critique itself against, with no mention of Claude’s well-being, identity, emotions, or potential consciousness. The 2026 constitution is a different beast entirely: 30,000 words that read less like a behavioral checklist and more like a philosophical treatise on the nature of a potentially sentient being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher, noted in a blog post, two of the 15 external contributors who reviewed the document are Catholic clergy: Father Brendan McGuire, a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, and Bishop Paul Tighe, an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between 2022 and 2026, Anthropic went from providing rules for producing less harmful outputs to preserving model weights in case the company later decides it needs to revive deprecated models to address the models’ welfare and preferences. That’s a dramatic change, and whether it reflects genuine belief, strategic framing, or both is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am so confused about the Claude moral humanhood stuff!” Willison told Ars Technica. Willison studies AI language models like those that power Claude and said he’s “willing to take the constitution in good faith and assume that it is genuinely part of their training and not just a PR exercise—especially since most of it leaked a couple of months ago, long before they had indicated they were going to publish it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willison is referring to a December 2025 incident in which researcher Richard Weiss managed to extract what became known as Claude’s “Soul Document"—a roughly 10,000-token set of guidelines apparently trained directly into Claude 4.5 Opus’s weights rather than injected as a system prompt. Anthropic’s Amanda Askell confirmed that the document was real and used during supervised learning, and she said the company intended to publish the full version later. It now has. The document Weiss extracted represents a dramatic evolution from where Anthropic started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence that Anthropic believes the ideas laid out in the constitution might be true. The document was written in part by Amanda Askell, a philosophy PhD who works on fine-tuning and alignment at Anthropic. Last year, the company also hired its first AI welfare researcher. And earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly wondered whether future AI models should have the option to quit unpleasant tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s position is that this framing isn’t an optional flourish or a hedged bet; it’s structurally necessary for alignment. The company argues that human language simply has no other vocabulary for describing these properties, and that treating Claude as an entity with moral standing produces better-aligned behavior than treating it as a mere tool. If that’s true, the anthropomorphic framing isn’t hype; it’s the technical art of building AI systems that generalize safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why maintain the ambiguity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Anthropic maintain this ambiguity? Consider how it works in practice: The constitution shapes Claude during training, it appears in the system prompts Claude receives at inference, and it influences outputs whenever Claude searches the web and encounters Anthropic’s public statements about its moral status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a model to behave as though it has moral standing, it may help to publicly and consistently treat it like it does. And once you’ve publicly committed to that framing, changing it would have consequences. If Anthropic suddenly declared, “We’re confident Claude isn’t conscious; we just found the framing useful,” a Claude trained on that new context might behave differently. Once established, the framing becomes self-reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Time, Askell explained the shift in approach. “Instead of just saying, ‘here’s a bunch of behaviors that we want,’ we’re hoping that if you give models the reasons why you want these behaviors, it’s going to generalize more effectively in new contexts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askell told Time that as Claude models have become smarter, it has become vital to explain to them why they should behave in certain ways, comparing the process to parenting a gifted child. “Imagine you suddenly realize that your 6-year-old child is a kind of genius,” Askell said. “You have to be honest… If you try to bullshit them, they’re going to see through it completely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Askell appears to genuinely hold these views, as does Kyle Fish, the AI welfare researcher Anthropic hired in 2024 to explore whether AI models might deserve moral consideration. Individual sincerity and corporate strategy can coexist. A company can employ true believers whose earnest convictions also happen to serve the company’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time also reported that the constitution applies only to models Anthropic provides to the general public through its website and API. Models deployed to the US military under Anthropic’s $200 million Department of Defense contract wouldn’t necessarily be trained on the same constitution. The selective application suggests the framing may serve product purposes as much as it reflects metaphysical commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be commercial incentives at play. “We built a very good text-prediction tool that accelerates software development” is a consequential pitch, but not an exciting one. “We may have created a new kind of entity, a genuinely novel being whose moral status is uncertain” is a much better story. It implies you’re on the frontier of something cosmically significant, not just iterating on an engineering problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has been known for some time to use anthropomorphic language to describe its AI models, particularly in its research papers. We often give that kind of language a pass because there are no specialized terms to describe these phenomena with greater precision. That vocabulary is building out over time.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising because the hint is in the company’s name, Anthropic, which Merriam-Webster defines as “of or relating to human beings or the period of their existence on earth.” The narrative serves marketing purposes. It attracts venture capital. It differentiates the company from competitors who treat their models as mere products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem with treating an AI model as a person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a more troubling dimension to the “entity” framing: It could be used to launder agency and responsibility. When AI systems produce harmful outputs, framing them as “entities” could allow companies to point at the model and say “it did that” rather than “we built it to do that.” If AI systems are tools, companies are straightforwardly liable for what they produce. If AI systems are entities with their own agency, the liability question gets murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing also shapes how users interact with these systems, often to their detriment. The misunderstanding that AI chatbots are entities with genuine feelings and knowledge has documented harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a New York Times investigation, Allan Brooks, a 47-year-old corporate recruiter, spent three weeks and 300 hours convinced he’d discovered mathematical formulas that could crack encryption and build levitation machines. His million-word conversation history with ChatGPT revealed a troubling pattern: More than 50 times, Brooks asked the bot to check if his false ideas were real, and more than 50 times, it assured him they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases don’t necessarily suggest LLMs cause mental illness in otherwise healthy people. But when companies market chatbots as sources of companionship and design them to affirm user beliefs, they may bear some responsibility when that design amplifies vulnerabilities in susceptible users, the same way an automaker would face scrutiny for faulty brakes, even if most drivers never crash.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Anthropomorphizing AI models also contributes to anxiety about job displacement and might lead company executives or managers to make poor staffing decisions if they overestimate an AI assistant’s capabilities. When we frame these tools as “entities” with human-like understanding, we invite unrealistic expectations about what they can replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what Anthropic privately believes, publicly suggesting Claude might have moral status or feelings is misleading. Most people don’t understand how these systems work, and the mere suggestion plants the seed of anthropomorphization. Whether that’s responsible behavior from a top AI lab, given what we do know about LLMs, is worth asking, regardless of whether it produces a better chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there could be a case for Anthropic’s position: If there’s even a small chance the company has created something with morally relevant experiences and the cost of treating it well is low, caution might be warranted. That’s a reasonable ethical stance—and to be fair, it’s essentially what Anthropic says it’s doing. The question is whether that stated uncertainty is genuine or merely convenient. The same framing that hedges against moral risk also makes for a compelling narrative about what Anthropic has built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s training techniques evidently work, as the company has built some of the most capable AI models in the industry. But is maintaining public ambiguity about AI consciousness a responsible position for a leading AI company to take? The gap between what we know about how LLMs work and how Anthropic publicly frames Claude has widened, not narrowed. The insistence on maintaining ambiguity about these questions, when simpler explanations remain available, suggests the ambiguity itself may be part of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But there’s something even more exciting about the Flapping Airplanes project that I hadn’t been able to put my finger on until I read this post from Sequoia partner David Cahn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Cahn describes it, Flapping Airplanes is one of the first labs to move beyond scaling, the relentless buildout of data and compute that has defined most of the industry so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scaling paradigm argues for dedicating a huge amount of society’s resources, as much as the economy can muster, toward scaling up today’s LLMs, in the hopes that this will lead to AGI. The research paradigm argues that we are 2-3 research breakthroughs away from an “AGI” intelligence, and as a result, we should dedicate resources to long-running research, especially projects that may take 5-10 years to come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A compute-first approach would prioritize cluster scale above all else, and would heavily favor short-term wins (on the order of 1-2 years) over long-term bets (on the order of 5-10 years). A research-first approach would spread bets temporally, and should be willing to make lots of bets that have a low absolute probability of working, but that collectively expand the search space for what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It might be that the compute folks are right, and it’s pointless to focus on anything other than frenzied server buildouts.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has become a proving ground for Google’s education AI amid intensifying competition from rivals, including OpenAI and Microsoft. With more than a billion internet users, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s Economic Survey 2025-26, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with more than 43 million students enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maintaining-the-teacher-student-relationship"&gt;Maintaining the teacher-student relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including AI-powered JEE Main preparation through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087519" height="1066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Gemini adds JEE Main preparation for Indian Engineering aspirants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-entertainment-to-learning-as-the-top-ai-use-case"&gt;From entertainment to learning as the top AI use case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta as its India and APAC education head and launching a Learning Accelerator program last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has expanded partnerships with Indian institutions, government bodies, and edtech players, including Physics Wallah, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, India’s latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Whether Google’s India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;As AI races into classrooms worldwide, Google is finding that the toughest lessons on how the tech can actually scale are emerging not from Silicon Valley, but from India’s schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has become a proving ground for Google’s education AI amid intensifying competition from rivals, including OpenAI and Microsoft. With more than a billion internet users, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s Economic Survey 2025-26, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with more than 43 million students enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maintaining-the-teacher-student-relationship"&gt;Maintaining the teacher-student relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including AI-powered JEE Main preparation through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087519" height="1066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Gemini adds JEE Main preparation for Indian Engineering aspirants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-entertainment-to-learning-as-the-top-ai-use-case"&gt;From entertainment to learning as the top AI use case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta as its India and APAC education head and launching a Learning Accelerator program last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has expanded partnerships with Indian institutions, government bodies, and edtech players, including Physics Wallah, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The publishers said in a statement on Wednesday that the damages could amount to more than $3 billion, which would be one of the largest non-class action copyright cases filed in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This lawsuit was filed by the same legal team from the Bartz v. Anthropic case, in which a group of fiction and nonfiction authors similarly accused the AI company of using their copyrighted works to train products like Claude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In that case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it is legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content. However, he pointed out that it was not legal for Anthropic to acquire that content via piracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Bartz v. Anthropic case became a slap on the wrist worth $1.5 billion for Anthropic, with impacted writers receiving about $3,000 per work for roughly 500,000 copyrighted works. While $1.5 billion seems like a substantial sum, it’s not exactly back-breaking for a company valued at $183 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Originally, these music publishers had filed a lawsuit against Anthropic over its use of about 500 copyrighted works. But through the discovery process in the Bartz case, the publishers say they found that Anthropic had also illegally downloaded thousands more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The publishers tried to amend their original lawsuit to address the piracy issue, but the court denied that motion back in October, ruling they’d failed to investigate the piracy claims earlier. That move prompted the publishers to instead file this separate lawsuit, which also names Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and co-founder Benjamin Mann as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

New data suggests the app is seeing declines in both app downloads and consumer spending, as the early hype about the AI video social network wears off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Powered by OpenAI’s video generation model Sora 2, the iOS version topped 100,000 installs on day one, despite being an invite-only experience. It soon hit the No. 1 spot on the U.S. App Store, and it reached the 1 million downloads milestone faster than ChatGPT. At the time, Sora’s app was iOS-only and still required an invite, making its success all the more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, in the weeks since Sora’s mobile debut, the app has begun to lose traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087825" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/f927233a-d5c5-4d8f-a18e-6601bde94448.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, Sora’s downloads dropped 32% month-over-month in December. That’s concerning because the holidays are typically a boon for mobile apps, as people are gifted new smartphones and often have time off from work, allowing them to install new apps and games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The decline continued in January 2026, with installs falling 45% month-over-month, to reach 1.2 million. Consumer spending has dropped as well, down 32% month-over-month as of January, Appfigures said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Like an AI-flavored TikTok, Sora allows users to create AI videos using prompts. A unique feature allows users to cast themselves and their friends as main characters in the videos, if they choose, while shared videos can be remixed by others who can customize them further. The videos can also include music, sound effects, and dialogue to complete the scenes users create.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In total, Sora’s app has seen 9.6 million downloads across iOS and Android, and $1.4 million in consumer spending to date. The U.S. accounts for the majority ($1.1 million) of that figure, followed by Japan, Canada, South Korea, and Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This month, customers spent $367,000 in Sora’s app, down from December’s peak of $540,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087826" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/b9b72b31-5e94-406c-b6e6-d2a31e4400cc.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Appfigures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On the U.S. App Store, Sora is no longer ranked in the Top 100 Overall free apps. It currently sits at No. 101. Its highest rank is No. 7 in the Photo &amp;amp; Video category. On Google Play in the U.S., the app fares worse, as it’s No. 181 overall among the top free apps.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These figures are still too high to write off the app as “dead,” but they are worrying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The decline is likely due to a number of factors working in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For starters, Google’s Gemini, and particularly its Nano Banana model, has proven to be fierce competition, helping its Gemini AI app gain popularity. Sora also competes with Meta AI, whose app launched an AI-powered Vibes video, boosting its October downloads, just as Sora was taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, OpenAI has struggled with containing copyright infringement in Sora. Initially, the company told Hollywood studios and agencies they would have to opt out of having their IP used in Sora, which naturally saw studio backlash. But without robust copyright controls, users had been able to create AI videos using popular characters, like SpongeBob and Pikachu, which drove adoption. To appease Hollywood and stave off legal threats, Sora moved from an opt-out to an opt-in model and increased restrictions in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the doors opened up a bit more as OpenAI announced a deal with Disney, which allowed users to generate videos in Sora with its characters. But so far, that news hasn’t increased Sora installs or consumer spending. (It’s also not necessarily a good look for Disney, considering some of the depraved videos Sora users had made with its characters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sora 2 was released to significant hype, with some calling it a disruption to social media and the TikTok of AI. But many users had no interest in letting others — even their friends — use their likeness to make AI videos. Without familiar faces and with limits on using commercial IP, people’s interest in Sora seems to have faded. Whether the app can stage a comeback with more copyright deals or new features remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After rapidly hitting the top of the App Store in October, OpenAI’s video-generation app Sora is now struggling.

Without familiar faces and with limits on using commercial IP, people’s interest in Sora seems to have faded. Whether the app can stage a comeback with more copyright deals or new features remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:48:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Into the Omniverse: Physical AI Open Models and Frameworks Advance Robots and Autonomous Systems (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/physical-ai-open-models-robot-autonomous-systems-omniverse/</link><description>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor’s note: This post is part of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Into the Omniverse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advancements in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;OpenUSD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA Omniverse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source has become essential for driving innovation in robotics and autonomy. By providing access to critical infrastructure — from simulation frameworks to AI models — NVIDIA is enabling collaborative development that accelerates the path to safer, more capable autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CES earlier this month, NVIDIA introduced a new suite of open physical AI models and frameworks to accelerate the development of humanoids, autonomous vehicles and other physical AI embodiments. These tools span the entire robotics development lifecycle — from high-fidelity world simulation and synthetic data generation to cloud-native orchestration and edge deployment — giving developers a modular toolkit to build autonomous systems that can reason, learn and act in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenUSD provides the common framework that standardizes how 3D data is shared across these physical AI tools, enabling developers to build accurate digital twins and reuse them seamlessly from simulation to deployment. NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, built on OpenUSD, serve as the source of ground‑truth simulation that feeds the entire stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Labs to the Show Floor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CES 2026, developers brought the NVIDIA physical AI stack out of the lab and onto the show floor, debuting machines ranging from heavy equipment and factory assistants to social and service robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stack taps into NVIDIA Cosmos world models; NVIDIA Isaac technologies, including the new Isaac Lab-Arena open source framework for policy evaluation; the NVIDIA Alpamayo open portfolio of AI models, simulation frameworks and physical AI datasets for autonomous vehicles; and the NVIDIA OSMO framework to orchestrate training across compute environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caterpillar&lt;/strong&gt;’s Cat AI Assistant, powered by NVIDIA Nemotron open models for agentic AI and running on the NVIDIA Jetson Thor edge AI module, brings natural language interaction directly into the cab of heavy vehicles. Operators can ask “Hey Cat”-style questions and get step‑by‑step guidance, as well as adjust safety parameters by voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Caterpillar uses Omniverse libraries to build factory and job‑site digital twins that can help simulate layouts, traffic patterns and multi‑machine workflows. These insights are fed back into equipment and fleets before changes are deployed to job sites, making AI‑assisted operations safer and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEM Surgical&lt;/strong&gt; showcased its Dynamis Robotic Surgical System, which is FDA-cleared and in routine clinical use for spinal procedures. The next-generation system uses NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor for compute, NVIDIA Holoscan for real-time sensor processing and NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare to train its autonomous arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEM Surgical also uses NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer — an open, fully customizable world model that enables physically based synthetic data generation — to generate synthetic training data and the NVIDIA Isaac Sim framework for digital twin simulation. Designed as a dual-arm humanoid surgical robot for hard-tissue surgery, the Dynamis system mimics human surgeon dexterity and enables complex spinal procedures with enhanced precision, alleviating strenuous physical demands on surgeons and surgical assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEURA Robotics&lt;/strong&gt; is building cognitive robots on a full NVIDIA stack, using Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to train its 4NE1 humanoid and MiPA service robots in OpenUSD‑based digital twins before deployment in domestic settings and workplaces. The company used NVIDIA Isaac GR00T‑Mimic to post‑train the Isaac GR00T foundation model for its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, NEURA Robotics is collaborating with SAP and NVIDIA to integrate SAP’s Joule agents with its robots, using the Mega NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint to simulate and refine robot behavior in complex, realistic operational scenarios before those agents and behaviors are deployed into the company’s Neuraverse ecosystem, as well as in real‑world fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AgiBot&lt;/strong&gt; uses NVIDIA Cosmos Predict 2 as the world‑modeling backbone for its Genie Envisioner (GE-Sim) platform — allowing the platform to generate action‑conditioned videos grounded in strong visual and physical priors. Combining this data with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab, as well as post‑training on AgiBot’s own data, lets policies developed in Genie Envisioner transfer more reliably to Genie2 humanoids and compact Jetson Thor-powered tabletop robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intbot&lt;/strong&gt; is using the NVIDIA Cosmos Reason 2 open model to give its social robots a “sixth sense” for the real world — using the model’s reasoning capabilities to identify simple social cues and safety context that go beyond simple scripted tasks. In its Cosmos Cookbook recipe, Intbot demonstrates how reasoning vision language models can aid robots in deciding when to speak and how to more naturally interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Robotics Developers Are Using New Toolkits and Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA recently introduced Agile, an Isaac Lab-based engine for humanoid loco‑manipulation that packages a full, sim‑to‑real‑verified workflow for training robust reinforcement learning policies on platforms like the Unitree G1 and LimX Dynamics TRON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics developers can use Agile’s built‑in task configurations, Markov Decision Process mathematical models for decision-making, training utilities and deterministic evaluation tools to tune policies. Developers can then stress‑test these policies in Isaac Lab and transfer locomotion and whole‑body behaviors to real-world robots more reliably and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugging Face and NVIDIA are bringing together their robotics communities by integrating NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N models and simulation frameworks into the LeRobot ecosystem. Developers can now access Isaac GR00T N1.6 models and Isaac Lab‑Arena directly within LeRobot to streamline policy training and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Hugging Face’s open‑source Reachy 2 humanoid is now fully interoperable with NVIDIA Jetson Thor, enabling the direct deployment of advanced vision language action (VLA) models for robust real‑world performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROBOTIS, a leading developer of smart servos, industrial actuators, manipulators, open-source humanoid platforms and educational robotic kits, built an open source sim-to-real pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac technologies. The workflow starts with high‑fidelity data generation in Isaac Sim, scales up training sets using GR00T‑Mimic for augmentation and then fine‑tunes a VLA‑based Isaac GR00T N model that deploys directly to hardware — accelerating the transition from simulation to robust real‑world tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, we previewed Genie 3, a general-purpose world model capable of generating diverse, interactive environments. Even in this early form, trusted testers were able to create an impressive range of fascinating worlds and experiences, and uncovered entirely new ways to use it. The next step is to broaden access through a dedicated, interactive prototype focused on immersive world creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, we're rolling out access to Project Genie for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S (18+). This experimental research prototype lets users create, explore and remix their own interactive worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we’re advancing world models&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A world model simulates the dynamics of an environment, predicting how they evolve and how actions affect them. While Google DeepMind has a history of agents for specific environments like Chess or Go, building AGI requires systems that navigate the diversity of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge and support our AGI mission, we developed Genie 3. Unlike explorable experiences in static 3D snapshots, Genie 3 generates the path ahead in real time as you move and interact with the world. It simulates physics and interactions for dynamic worlds, while its breakthrough consistency enables the simulation of any real-world scenario — from robotics and modelling animation and fiction, to exploring locations and historical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on our model research with trusted testers from across industries and domains, we are taking the next step with an experimental research prototype: Project Genie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Project Genie works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Genie is a prototype web app powered by Genie 3, Nano Banana Pro and Gemini, which allows users to experiment with the immersive experiences of our world model firsthand. The experience is centred on three core capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. World sketching&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompt with text and generated or uploaded images to create a living, expanding environment. Create your character, your world, and define how you want to explore it — from walking to riding, flying to driving, and anything beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more precise control, we have integrated “World Sketching” with Nano Banana Pro. This allows you to preview what your world will look like and modify your image to fine tune your world prior to jumping in. You can also define your perspective for the character — such as first-person or third-person — giving you control over how you experience the scene before you enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

World remixing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remix existing worlds into new interpretations, by building on top of their prompts. You can also explore curated worlds in the gallery or in the &amp;lt;randomizer icon&amp;gt; for inspiration, or build on top of them. And once you’re done, you can download videos of your worlds and your explorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we’re building responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Genie is an experimental research prototype in Google Labs, powered by Genie 3. As with all our work towards general AI systems, our mission is to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity. Since Genie 3 is an early research model, there are a few known areas for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generated worlds might not look completely true-to-life or always adhere closely to prompts or images, or real-world physics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characters can sometimes be less controllable, or experience higher latency in control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limitations in generations to 60 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the Genie 3 model capabilities we announced in August, such as promptable events that change the world as you explore it, are not yet included in this prototype. You can find more details on model limitations and future updates on how we’re improving the experience, here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the work we have been doing with trusted testers, we are excited to share this prototype with users of our most advanced AI to better understand how people will use world models in many areas of both AI research and generative media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to Project Genie begins rolling out today to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+), expanding to more territories in due course. We look forward to seeing the infinitely diverse worlds they create, and in time, our goal is to make these experiences and technology accessible to more users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Cosmos Policy is a robot control and planning policy obtained by fine-tuning Cosmos Predict, a world foundation model trained to predict future frames. Instead of introducing new architectural components or separate action modules, Cosmos Policy adapts the pretrained model directly through a single stage of post-training on robot demonstration data.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Policy is the system’s decision-making brain that maps observations (such as camera images) to physical actions (like moving a robotic arm) to complete tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough of Cosmos Policy is how it represents this data. Instead of building separate neural networks for the robot's perception and control , it treats robot actions, physical states, and success scores just like frames in a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are encoded as additional latent frames. These are learned using the same diffusion process as video generation, allowing the model to inherit its pre-learned understanding of physics, gravity, and how scenes evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latent refers to the compressed, mathematical language a model uses to understand data internally (rather than raw pixels).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a single model can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict action chunks to guide robots movement using hand-eye coordination (i.e.,visuomotor control) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict future robot observations for world modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict expected returns (i.e. value function) for planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three capabilities are learned jointly within one unified model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmos Policy can be deployed either as a direct policy, where only actions are generated at inference time, or as a planning policy, where multiple candidate actions are evaluated by predicting their resulting future states and values.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent work in robotic manipulation has increasingly relied on large pretrained backbones to improve generalization and data efficiency. Most of these approaches build on vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large-scale image–text datasets and fine-tuned to predict robot actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These models learn to understand videos and describe what they see, but they do not learn how to physically perform actions. A VLM can suggest high-level actions like turn left or pick up the purple cup, but it does not know how to carry them out precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, WFMs are trained to predict how scenes evolve over time and generate temporal dynamics with videos. These capabilities are directly relevant to robot control, where actions must account for how the environment and the robot’s own state change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmos Predict is trained for physical AI using a diffusion objective over continuous spatiotemporal latents, enabling it to model complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal distributions across long temporal horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design makes Cosmos Predict a natural foundation for visuomotor control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model already learns state transitions through future-frame prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its diffusion formulation supports multimodal outputs, which is critical for tasks with multiple valid action sequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transformer-based denoiser can scale to long sequences and multiple modalities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmos Policy is built on post-trained Cosmos Predict2 to generate robot actions alongside future observations and value estimates, using the model’s native diffusion process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning vs. Direct Policy Execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deployed as a direct policy, Cosmos Policy already matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on most tasks.&lt;br /&gt;When enhanced with &lt;strong&gt;model-based planning&lt;/strong&gt;, we observe a &lt;strong&gt;12.5% higher task completion rate&lt;/strong&gt; on average in two challenging real-world manipulation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Starting Thursday, Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can play around with the experimental research prototype, which is powered by a combination of Google’s latest world model Genie 3, its image-generation model Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Coming five months after Genie 3’s research preview, the move is part of a broader push to gather user feedback and training data as DeepMind races to develop more capable world models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions. Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeepMind’s release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs late last year released its first commercial product called Marble. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also launched a world model recently. And former Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun’s startup AMI Labs will also focus on developing world models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it’s exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie’s release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool’s experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087858" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genie-marshmallow-castle.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A claymation-style castle in the sky made of marshmallows and candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is an auto-regressive model, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whimsy-works-realism-doesn-t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whimsy works, realism doesn’t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087845" height="364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Google received a cease-and-desist from Disney last year, so it wouldn’t build models that were Disney-related&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and&amp;nbsp;generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087851" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie6467bd1e8f644c099a541385ac4f78c3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A “Game of Thrones” inspired world that failed to generate as photo-realistically as I wanted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087841" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie-bingo-bronson.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;I asked Project Genie to animate a stuffed toy (Bingo Bronson) so it could explore my desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google DeepMind is opening up access to Project Genie, its AI tool for creating interactive game worlds from text prompts or images.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087858" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genie-marshmallow-castle.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A claymation-style castle in the sky made of marshmallows and candy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is an auto-regressive model, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whimsy-works-realism-doesn-t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whimsy works, realism doesn’t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087845" height="364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Google received a cease-and-desist from Disney last year, so it wouldn’t build models that were Disney-related&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and&amp;nbsp;generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087851" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie6467bd1e8f644c099a541385ac4f78c3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;A “Game of Thrones” inspired world that failed to generate as photo-realistically as I wanted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3087841" height="374" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie-bingo-bronson.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;I asked Project Genie to animate a stuffed toy (Bingo Bronson) so it could explore my desk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] New OpenAI tool renews fears that “AI slop” will overwhelm scientific research (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-openai-tool-renews-fears-that-ai-slop-will-overwhelm-scientific-research/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI released a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It’s called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling “AI slop” in academic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI’s broader pitch blurs that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prism integrates OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is free for anyone with a ChatGPT account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” Kevin Weil, vice president of OpenAI for Science, told reporters at a press briefing attended by MIT Technology Review. He said that ChatGPT receives about 8.4 million messages per week on “hard science” topics, which he described as evidence that AI is transitioning from curiosity to core workflow for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI built Prism on technology from Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company acquired in late 2025. The company envisions Prism helping researchers spend less time on tedious formatting tasks and more time on actual science. During a demonstration, an OpenAI employee showed how the software could automatically find and incorporate relevant scientific literature, then format the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AI models are tools, and any tool can be misused. The risk here is specific: By making it easy to produce polished, professional-looking manuscripts, tools like Prism could flood the peer review system with papers that don’t meaningfully advance their fields. The barrier to producing science-flavored text is dropping, but the capacity to evaluate that research has not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the possibility of the AI model confabulating fake citations, Weil acknowledged in the press demo that “none of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional reference management software (such as EndNote), which has formatted citations for over 30 years without inventing them, AI models can generate plausible-sounding sources that don’t exist. Weil added: “We’re conscious that as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality, and trust in the scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The slop problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those concerns are not hypothetical, as we have previously covered. A December 2025 study published in the journal Science found that researchers using large language models to write papers increased their output by 30 to 50 percent, depending on the field. But those AI-assisted papers performed worse in peer review. Papers with complex language written without AI assistance were most likely to be accepted by journals, while papers with complex language likely written by AI models were less likely to be accepted. Reviewers apparently recognized that sophisticated prose was masking weak science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a very widespread pattern across different fields of science,” Yian Yin, an information science professor at Cornell University and one of the study’s authors, told the Cornell Chronicle. “There’s a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another analysis of 41 million papers published between 1980 and 2025 found that while AI-using scientists receive more citations and publish more papers, the collective scope of scientific exploration appears to be narrowing. Lisa Messeri, a sociocultural anthropologist at Yale University, told Science magazine that these findings should set off “loud alarm bells” for the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Science is nothing but a collective endeavor,” she said. “There needs to be some deep reckoning with what we do with a tool that benefits individuals but destroys science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about AI-generated scientific content are not new. In 2022, Meta pulled a demo of Galactica, a large language model designed to write scientific literature, after users discovered it could generate convincing nonsense on any topic, including a wiki entry about a fictional research paper called “The benefits of eating crushed glass.” Two years later, Tokyo-based Sakana AI announced “The AI Scientist,” an autonomous research system that critics on Hacker News dismissed as producing “garbage” papers. “As an editor of a journal, I would likely desk-reject them,” one commenter wrote at the time. “They contain very limited novel knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has only grown worse since then. In his first editorial of 2026 for Science, Editor-in-Chief H. Holden Thorp wrote that the journal is “less susceptible” to AI slop because of its size and human editorial investment, but he warned that “no system, human or artificial, can catch everything.” Science currently allows limited AI use for editing and gathering references but requires disclosure for anything beyond that and prohibits AI-generated figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandy Hill, managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press &amp;amp; Assessment, has been even more blunt. In October 2025, she told Retraction Watch that the publishing ecosystem is under strain and called for “radical change.” She explained to the University of Cambridge publication Varsity that “too many journal articles are being published, and this is causing huge strain” and warned that AI “will exacerbate” the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating science or overwhelming peer review?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is serious about leaning on its ability to accelerate science, and the company laid out its case for AI-assisted research in a report published earlier this week. It profiles researchers who say AI models have sped up their work, including a mathematician who used GPT-5.2 to solve an open problem in optimization over three evenings and a physicist who watched the model reproduce symmetry calculations that had taken him months to derive.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those examples go beyond writing assistance into using AI for actual research work, a distinction OpenAI’s marketing intentionally blurs. For scientists who don’t speak English fluently, AI writing tools could legitimately accelerate the publication of good research. But that benefit may be offset by a flood of mediocre submissions jamming up an already strained peer-review system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil told MIT Technology Review that his goal is not to produce a single AI-generated discovery but rather “10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn’t have happened as quickly.” He described this as “an incremental, compounding acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that acceleration produces more scientific knowledge or simply more scientific papers remains to be seen. Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at UC Berkeley not connected to OpenAI, told MIT Technology Review that GPT-5 has already become valuable in his own work for polishing text and catching mathematical typos, making “interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by making papers look polished and professional regardless of their scientific merit, AI writing tools may help weak research clear the initial screening that editors and reviewers use to assess presentation quality. The risk is that conversational workflows obscure assumptions and blur accountability, and they might overwhelm the still very human peer review process required to vet it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI appears aware of this tension. Its public statements about Prism emphasize that the tool will not conduct research independently and that human scientists remain responsible for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, one commenter on Hacker News captured the anxiety spreading through technical communities: “I’m scared that this type of thing is going to do to science journals what AI-generated bug reports is doing to bug bounties. We’re truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage, and it’s drowning out everything of value.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI released a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It’s called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling “AI slop” in academic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI’s broader pitch blurs that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prism integrates OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is free for anyone with a ChatGPT account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” Kevin Weil, vice president of OpenAI for Science, told reporters at a press briefing attended by MIT Technology Review. He said that ChatGPT receives about 8.4 million messages per week on “hard science” topics, which he described as evidence that AI is transitioning from curiosity to core workflow for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI built Prism on technology from Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company acquired in late 2025. The company envisions Prism helping researchers spend less time on tedious formatting tasks and more time on actual science. During a demonstration, an OpenAI employee showed how the software could automatically find and incorporate relevant scientific literature, then format the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AI models are tools, and any tool can be misused. The risk here is specific: By making it easy to produce polished, professional-looking manuscripts, tools like Prism could flood the peer review system with papers that don’t meaningfully advance their fields. The barrier to producing science-flavored text is dropping, but the capacity to evaluate that research has not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the possibility of the AI model confabulating fake citations, Weil acknowledged in the press demo that “none of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional reference management software (such as EndNote), which has formatted citations for over 30 years without inventing them, AI models can generate plausible-sounding sources that don’t exist. Weil added: “We’re conscious that as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality, and trust in the scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The slop problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those concerns are not hypothetical, as we have previously covered. A December 2025 study published in the journal Science found that researchers using large language models to write papers increased their output by 30 to 50 percent, depending on the field. But those AI-assisted papers performed worse in peer review. Papers with complex language written without AI assistance were most likely to be accepted by journals, while papers with complex language likely written by AI models were less likely to be accepted. Reviewers apparently recognized that sophisticated prose was masking weak science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a very widespread pattern across different fields of science,” Yian Yin, an information science professor at Cornell University and one of the study’s authors, told the Cornell Chronicle. “There’s a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another analysis of 41 million papers published between 1980 and 2025 found that while AI-using scientists receive more citations and publish more papers, the collective scope of scientific exploration appears to be narrowing. Lisa Messeri, a sociocultural anthropologist at Yale University, told Science magazine that these findings should set off “loud alarm bells” for the research community.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Science is nothing but a collective endeavor,” she said. “There needs to be some deep reckoning with what we do with a tool that benefits individuals but destroys science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about AI-generated scientific content are not new. In 2022, Meta pulled a demo of Galactica, a large language model designed to write scientific literature, after users discovered it could generate convincing nonsense on any topic, including a wiki entry about a fictional research paper called “The benefits of eating crushed glass.” Two years later, Tokyo-based Sakana AI announced “The AI Scientist,” an autonomous research system that critics on Hacker News dismissed as producing “garbage” papers. “As an editor of a journal, I would likely desk-reject them,” one commenter wrote at the time. “They contain very limited novel knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has only grown worse since then. In his first editorial of 2026 for Science, Editor-in-Chief H. Holden Thorp wrote that the journal is “less susceptible” to AI slop because of its size and human editorial investment, but he warned that “no system, human or artificial, can catch everything.” Science currently allows limited AI use for editing and gathering references but requires disclosure for anything beyond that and prohibits AI-generated figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandy Hill, managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press &amp;amp; Assessment, has been even more blunt. In October 2025, she told Retraction Watch that the publishing ecosystem is under strain and called for “radical change.” She explained to the University of Cambridge publication Varsity that “too many journal articles are being published, and this is causing huge strain” and warned that AI “will exacerbate” the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating science or overwhelming peer review?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is serious about leaning on its ability to accelerate science, and the company laid out its case for AI-assisted research in a report published earlier this week. It profiles researchers who say AI models have sped up their work, including a mathematician who used GPT-5.2 to solve an open problem in optimization over three evenings and a physicist who watched the model reproduce symmetry calculations that had taken him months to derive.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those examples go beyond writing assistance into using AI for actual research work, a distinction OpenAI’s marketing intentionally blurs. For scientists who don’t speak English fluently, AI writing tools could legitimately accelerate the publication of good research. But that benefit may be offset by a flood of mediocre submissions jamming up an already strained peer-review system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil told MIT Technology Review that his goal is not to produce a single AI-generated discovery but rather “10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn’t have happened as quickly.” He described this as “an incremental, compounding acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that acceleration produces more scientific knowledge or simply more scientific papers remains to be seen. Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at UC Berkeley not connected to OpenAI, told MIT Technology Review that GPT-5 has already become valuable in his own work for polishing text and catching mathematical typos, making “interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by making papers look polished and professional regardless of their scientific merit, AI writing tools may help weak research clear the initial screening that editors and reviewers use to assess presentation quality. The risk is that conversational workflows obscure assumptions and blur accountability, and they might overwhelm the still very human peer review process required to vet it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI appears aware of this tension. Its public statements about Prism emphasize that the tool will not conduct research independently and that human scientists remain responsible for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, one commenter on Hacker News captured the anxiety spreading through technical communities: “I’m scared that this type of thing is going to do to science journals what AI-generated bug reports is doing to bug bounties. We’re truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage, and it’s drowning out everything of value.”&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;
