His startup, &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt;, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/employee-benefits/zuckerbergs-100-million-ai-job-offers-pay-off-parmy-olson"&gt;$100 million offers&lt;/a&gt; seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a &lt;a href="https://billboardinsider.com/ai-startup/"&gt;billboard in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by &lt;a href="https://www.ribbitcap.com/"&gt;Ribbit Capital&lt;/a&gt; with participation from &lt;a href="https://www.evantic.ai/"&gt;Evantic&lt;/a&gt; and existing investors &lt;a href="https://sequoiacap.com/"&gt;Sequoia Capital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.conviction.com/"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pear.vc/"&gt;Pear VC&lt;/a&gt;. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/role/agencies"&gt;AI researcher&lt;/a&gt; finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: &amp;quot;Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&amp;#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.&amp;quot; The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, &amp;quot;gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&amp;#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&amp;#x27;t scale that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Listen&amp;#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. &amp;quot;In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen&lt;/a&gt; finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called &amp;quot;one of the most shocking things that we&amp;#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry&amp;quot;—rampant fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Essentially, there&amp;#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,&amp;quot; he explained. &amp;quot;We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built what it calls a &amp;quot;quality guard&amp;quot; that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: &amp;quot;People talk three times more. They&amp;#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/emeritus"&gt;Emeritus&lt;/a&gt;, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. &amp;quot;We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,&amp;quot; said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed advantage has proven central to Listen&amp;#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; could take four to six weeks to generate insights. &amp;quot;By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,&amp;quot; said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. &amp;quot;We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,&amp;quot; Patel said, &amp;quot;and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.&amp;quot; Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/simple-modern"&gt;Simple Modern&lt;/a&gt;, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. &amp;quot;We went from &amp;#x27;Should we even have this product?&amp;#x27; to &amp;#x27;How should we launch it?&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; said Chris Hoyle, the company&amp;#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/chubbies"&gt;Chubbies&lt;/a&gt;, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s school, sports, dinner, and homework,&amp;quot; explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. &amp;quot;I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI &amp;quot;through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.&amp;quot; The redesigned product became &amp;quot;a blockbuster hit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/ai-market-research/"&gt;$140 billion annually&lt;/a&gt;, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;Why we&amp;#x27;re replacing them is that one, they&amp;#x27;re super costly. Two, they&amp;#x27;re kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn&amp;#x27;t just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What I&amp;#x27;ve noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don&amp;#x27;t need less of it. You want more of it,&amp;quot; Wahlforss explained. &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren&amp;#x27;t researchers before can now do that as part of their job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. &amp;quot;We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,&amp;quot; Wahlforss recalled. &amp;quot;We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss&amp;#x27;s co-founder &amp;quot;was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.&amp;quot; The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the &lt;a href="https://ioinformatics.org/"&gt;International Olympiad in Informatics&lt;/a&gt; — the same competition that produced the founders of &lt;a href="https://cognition.ai/"&gt;Cognition&lt;/a&gt;, the AI coding startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-billboard-challenge-puts-ai-engineers-to-the-test/"&gt;Berghain billboard stunt&lt;/a&gt; generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But now we fixed that situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building &amp;quot;the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&amp;#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. &amp;quot;Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. &amp;quot;Obviously, as you said, there&amp;#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company already handles sensitive data with care. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#x27;t train on any of the data,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AI could reshape the future of product development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen&amp;#x27;s model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#x27;re based in Australia, so they&amp;#x27;re coding during the day, and then in their night, they&amp;#x27;re releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends Y Combinator&amp;#x27;s famous dictum — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice"&gt;write code, talk to users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — into an automated cycle. &amp;quot;Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you&amp;#x27;ll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen&amp;#x27;s control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A &lt;a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"&gt;2024 MIT study&lt;/a&gt; found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m constantly have to emphasize like, let&amp;#x27;s make sure the quality is there and the details are right,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company&amp;#x27;s growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Patel said Listen has &amp;quot;removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.&amp;quot; Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a total game changer,&amp;quot; said Ali Romero, Sling Money&amp;#x27;s marketing manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he&amp;#x27;s building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them: &amp;quot;Slow is fake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options.

Wahlforss&amp;#x27;s co-founder &amp;quot;was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.&amp;quot; The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the &lt;a href="https://ioinformatics.org/"&gt;International Olympiad in Informatics&lt;/a&gt; — the same competition that produced the founders of &lt;a href="https://cognition.ai/"&gt;Cognition&lt;/a&gt;, the AI coding startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-billboard-challenge-puts-ai-engineers-to-the-test/"&gt;Berghain billboard stunt&lt;/a&gt; generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But now we fixed that situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building &amp;quot;the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&amp;#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. &amp;quot;Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. &amp;quot;Obviously, as you said, there&amp;#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company already handles sensitive data with care. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#x27;t train on any of the data,&amp;quot; Wahlforss said. &amp;quot;We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How AI could reshape the future of product development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen&amp;#x27;s model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#x27;re based in Australia, so they&amp;#x27;re coding during the day, and then in their night, they&amp;#x27;re releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision extends Y Combinator&amp;#x27;s famous dictum — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice"&gt;write code, talk to users&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — into an automated cycle. &amp;quot;Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you&amp;#x27;ll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen&amp;#x27;s control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A &lt;a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"&gt;2024 MIT study&lt;/a&gt; found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m constantly have to emphasize like, let&amp;#x27;s make sure the quality is there and the details are right,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company&amp;#x27;s growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Patel said Listen has &amp;quot;removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.&amp;quot; Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a total game changer,&amp;quot; said Ali Romero, Sling Money&amp;#x27;s marketing manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he&amp;#x27;s building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them: &amp;quot;Slow is fake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But &lt;a href="https://listenlabs.ai/"&gt;Listen Labs&lt;/a&gt; is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/technology/listen-labs-raises-usd69m-after-viral-billboard-hiring-stunt-to-scale-ai</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:01:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The rise of ‘micro’ apps: non-developers are writing apps instead of buying them (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/the-rise-of-micro-apps-non-developers-are-writing-apps-instead-of-buying-them/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Iain-Smith.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web-apps-and-mobile"&gt;Web apps and mobile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app,&amp;nbsp;we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-enough-for-one-nbsp"&gt;Good enough for one&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Iain-Smith.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking with the customers’ customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand.&amp;nbsp;“We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been an early winner. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1453486183.jpeg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Trump administration wants the largest electricity grid to add $15 billion worth of new power generation —&amp;nbsp;and he wants tech companies to pay for it, even if they don’t need the capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand.&amp;nbsp;“We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a blog post published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were introduced globally on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3083447" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;TechCrunch (Screenshot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world. In its blog post Friday, the company promised that its “pursuit of advertising is always in support of” its mission: that AGI “benefits all of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of&amp;nbsp;“computer-aided design suite” for molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where&amp;nbsp;we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/251201-ChaiDiscovery-group-5263.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process.

          &lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Financial pressures and a changing tune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2136120 align-center"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately&amp;nbsp;stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;X’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bootstrapping-growth"&gt;Bootstrapping growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they&amp;nbsp;formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;VCs were also on the prowl for investments.&amp;nbsp;Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
