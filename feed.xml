The report contains the company’s analysis of a million consumer interactions on Claude.ai, plus a million enterprise API calls, all dated from November 2025. The report notes that its figures are based on observations, rather than, for example, a sample of business decision-makers or generic survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limited-use-cases-dominate"&gt;Limited use cases dominate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Anthropic’s AI tends to cluster around a relatively small number of tasks, with the ten most frequently-performed tasks accounting for almost a quarter of consumer interactions, and nearly a third of enterprise API traffic. There’s a focus on the use of Claude for code creation and modification, as readers might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concentration of use of AI as a software development tool has remained fairly constant over time, suggesting that the model’s value is largely based around these types of tasks, with no emerging use of Claude for other purposes of any empirical significance. This suggests that broad, general rollouts of AI are less likely to be successful than those focused on tasks where large language models are proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-augmentation-outperforms-automation"&gt;Augmentation outperforms automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On consumer platforms, collaborative use – where users iterate on queries to the AI over the course of a virtual conversation – is more common than using the AI to produce automated workflows. Enterprise API usage shows the opposite, as businesses attempt to gain savings through automating tasks. However, while Claude succeeds on shorter tasks, the observed quality of outcomes declines the more complex the task (or series of tasks) is, and the longer the required ‘thinking time’ required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies automation is most effective for routine, well-defined tasks that are simpler, require fewer logical steps, and where responses to queries can be quick. Tasks estimated to take humans several hours show significantly lower completion rates than shorter tasks. For longer tasks to succeed, users have to iterate and correct outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users breaking down large tasks into manageable steps and posing each separately (either interactively or via API) have improved success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s observations show most queries put to the LLMs are associated with white-collar roles (although poorer countries tend to use Claude in academic settings more commonly than, for instance, the US). For example, travel agents can lose complex planning tasks to the LLM and retain elements of their more transactional work, while some roles, such as property managers, show the opposite: routine administrative tasks can be handled by the AI, and tasks needing higher-judgement remain with the human professional..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-productivity-gains-lessened-by-reliability"&gt;Productivity gains lessened by reliability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report notes that claims of AI boosting annual labour productivity by 1.8% (over a decade) are likely best to be reduced to 1-1.2%, due to the need to factor in extra labour and costs. While a 1% efficiency gain over a decade is still economically meaningful, the need for activities such as validation, error handling, and reworking will lower success rates and therefore there should be a similar adjustment in the minds of a business’s decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential gains to an organisation deploying AI also depend on whether tasks given to the LLM complement or substitute work. In the latter case, the success of substituting an AI for tasks normally done by a human depends on how complex the work is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s noteworthy that the report finds a near-perfect correlation between the sophistication of users’ prompts to the LLM and successful outcomes. Thus, how people use AI shapes what it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-takeaways-for-leaders"&gt;Key takeaways for leaders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list org-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI implementation delivers value fastest in specific, well-defined areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complementary systems (AI+human) outperform full automation for complex work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reliability and necessary extra work ‘around’ the AI reduce predicted productivity gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes to workforces’ makeup depend on the mix of tasks and their complexity, not specific job roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image source: “the virtual construction worker” by antjeverena is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit’s website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers’ day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India’s enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The trip would mark Altman’s first visit to India in nearly a year, after he traveled to the country in February 2025. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI’s August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit also comes as India has emerged as a key growth market for American AI companies. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. India has emerged as ChatGPT’s biggest market by downloads and second largest by users. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT’s enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced multibillion-dollar investments in India to expand their AI and cloud footprint. But India’s data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the Indian government is hopeful that the upcoming summit will cement India’s status as a destination for large-scale AI investment. The country’s IT minister said in a recent interview that the event could help attract as much as $100 billion in investment. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to build smaller models for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, India’s IT ministry, and the AI summit’s organizers did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198379368.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to visit India in mid-February, his first visit to the country in nearly a year, TechCrunch has learned. The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit’s website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman’s visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers’ day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.)

The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has been cracking down on teens’ access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3059397" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meta-AI-Controls_Visual2-1.jpeg?w=383" width="383" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Meta’s previously previewed controls around AI characters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user’s age to apply content restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches. It will include parental controls. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta today said that it is pausing teens’ access to its AI characters globally across all its apps.

On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says. A rep for Google told TechCrunch the feature will reach U.S. iOS and Android users over the “coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time. After the AI creates the image, you can save the photo, share it on other platforms, or tap “regenerate” to have it re-imagine the image a second time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Works-with-Google-Photos.jpg?resize=1200,500" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google Photos will now let you make memes with your own images.

    &lt;p&gt;GIST then looks for the maximum-utility subset that can be chosen where no two points are connected in this graph: the classic maximum independent set problem. Imagine planning a dinner party where certain guests can’t sit together. Your goal is to invite the most interesting group of people possible, but you must follow one rule: no two people at the table can have a conflict. This is a massive puzzle because picking one guest might "block" you from inviting three other high-interest people. To find the best combination, you have to check an exponential number of groupings, which is why it is considered one of the hardest problems in computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the max independent set problem itself is NP-complete (meaning that it’s widely believed there does not exist an efficient algorithm to find the absolute “perfect” answer for a massive dataset) and admits no reasonable approximation algorithm, GIST uses a carefully constructed bicriteria greedy algorithm to approximate the solution efficiently. It iterates through many possible distance thresholds, solving the corresponding independent set problem and ultimately selecting the best solution found across all thresholds. For any minimum distance &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; achieved by the optimum solution, GIST achieves a comparable utility to the optimum utility at distance threshold &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bicriteria greedy algorithm acts like a systematic "tuning knob" that finds the right balance between data variety and value. Instead of guessing, it analyzes the actual distances between all data points to create a list of potential spacing rules. It then tests these rules one by one: for each rule, it "greedily" grabs the most valuable points it can find, provided they aren't too close to the points it has already picked. By running this process across every relevant distance and comparing the results, the algorithm identifies the specific "sweet spot" that captures the most useful information while ensuring the data is as spread out as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By cleverly approximating a series of these maximum independent set problems, GIST manages to satisfy the utility goal while respecting the minimum diversity requirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Open_Graph.width-800.format-jpeg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This week, the startup finally confirmed what it’s building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On its newly launched website, the startup disclosed its plans to develop “world models” in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI’s name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field’s most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;World Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after coming out of stealth. After launching its first product, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now reportedly in talks to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun is an advisor. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Regardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has made clear, he is AMI’s executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LeBrun’s transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership announced last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI’s world models, Nabla’s board supported LeBrun’s shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As AMI Labs’ CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook acquired his previous startup, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun’s leadership at Meta’s AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to reports, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who stepped down as Meta’s vice president for Europe last December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won’t stop there. LeCun told the MIT Technology Review that his former employer could well be AMI’s first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta’s strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg’s direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs’ CEO told Forbes that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that’s] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who expressed his pride that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris’ reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It’s fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2198379447.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Yann LeCun’s new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it.
