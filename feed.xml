            &lt;p&gt;The Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship strives to teach students the craft of entrepreneurship. Over the last few years, no technology has changed that craft more than artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are predicting a rapid and complete transformation in how startups are built, the Trust Center’s leaders have a more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fundamentals of entrepreneurship haven’t changed with AI,” says Trust Center Entrepreneur in Residence Macauley Kenney. “There’s been a shift in how entrepreneurs accomplish tasks, and that trickles down into how you build a company, but we’re thinking of AI as another new tool in the toolkit. In some ways the world is moving a lot faster, but we also need to make sure the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship are well-understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach was on display during this summer’s delta v startup accelerator program, where many students regularly turned to AI tools but still ultimately relied on talking to their customers to make the right decisions for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in this year’s cohort used AI tools to accelerate their coding, draft presentations, learn about new industries, and brainstorm ideas. The Trust Center is encouraging students to use AI as they see fit while also staying mindful of the technology’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center itself has also embraced AI, most notably through Jetpack, its generative AI app that walks users through the 24 steps of disciplined entrepreneurship outlined in Managing Director Bill Aulet’s book of the same name. When students input a startup idea, the tool can suggest customer segments, early markets to pursue, business models, pricing, and a product plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways the Trust Center wants students to use Jetpack is apparent in its name: It’s inspired by the acceleration a jetpack provides, but users still need to guide its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with AI technology’s current limitations, the Trust Center’s leaders acknowledge it can be a powerful tool for people at any stage of building a business, and their use of AI will continue to evolve with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s undeniable we’re in the midst of an AI revolution right now,” says Entrepreneur in Residence Ben Soltoff. “AI is reshaping a lot of things we do, and it’s also shaping how we do entrepreneurship and how students build companies. The Trust Center has recognized that for years, and we’ve welcomed AI into how we teach entrepreneurship at all levels, from the earliest stages of idea formation to exploring and testing those ideas and understanding how to commercialize and scale them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s strengths and weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, when the Trust Center’s delta v staff get together for strategic retreats, AI has been a central topic. The delta v program’s organizers think about how students can get the most out of the technology each year as they plan their summer-long curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with Orbit, the mobile app designed to help students find entrepreneurial resources, network with peers, access mentorship, and identify events and jobs. Jetpack was added to Orbit last year. It is trained on Aulet’s “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” as well as former Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek’s “Startup Tactics” book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center describes Jetpack’s outputs as first drafts designed to help students brainstorm their next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to verify everything when you are using AI to build a business,” says Kenney, who is also a lecturer at MIT Sloan and MIT D-Lab. “I have yet to meet anyone who will base their business on the output of something like ChatGPT without verifying everything first. Sometimes, the verification can take longer than if you had done the research yourself from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company in this year’s cohort, Mendhai Health, uses AI and telehealth to offer personalized physical therapy for women struggling with pelvic floor dysfunction before and after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI has definitely made the entrepreneurial process more efficient and faster,” says MBA student Aanchal Arora. “Still, overreliance on AI, at least at this point, can hamper your understanding of customers. You need to be careful with every decision you make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney notes the way large language models are built can make them less useful for entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some AI tools can increase your speed by doing things like automatically sorting your email or helping you vibe code apps, but many AI tools are built off averages, and those can be less effective when you’re trying to connect with a very specific demographic,” Kenney says. “It’s not helpful to have AI tell you about an average person, you need to personally have strong validation that your specific customer exists. If you try to build a tool for an average person, you may build a tool for no one at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students eager to embrace AI may also be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tools available today. Fortunately, MIT students have a long history of being at the forefront of any new technology, and this year’s delta v cohort featured teams leveraging AI at the core of their solutions and in every step of their entrepreneurial journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Sloan MBA candidate Murtaza Jameel, whose company Cognify uses AI to simulates user interactions with websites and apps to improve digital experiences, describes his firm as an AI-native business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a design intelligence tool that replaces product testing with instant, predictive simulations of user behavior,” Jameel explains. “We’re trying to integrate AI into all of our processes: ideation, go to market, programming. All of our building has been done with AI coding tools. I have a custom bot that I’ve fed tons of information about our company to, and it’s a thought partner I’m speaking to every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more things change…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamentals the Trust Center doesn’t see changing is the need for students to get out of the lab or the classroom to talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are ways that AI can unlock new capabilities and make things move faster, but we haven’t turned our curriculum on its head because of AI,” Soltoff says. “In delta v, we stress first and foremost: What are you building and who are you building it for? AI alone can’t tell you who your customer is, what they want, and how you can better serve their needs. You need to go out into the world to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the biggest hurdles delta v teams faced this summer looked a lot like the hurdles entrepreneurs have always faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were prepared at the Trust Center to see a big change and to adapt to that, but the companies are still building and encountering the same challenges of customer identification, beachhead market identification, team dynamics,” Kenney says. “Those are still the big meaty challenges they’ve always been working on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid endless hype about AI agents and the future of work, many founders this summer still said the human side of delta v is what makes the program special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to MIT with one goal: to start a technology company,” Jameel says. “The delta v program was on my radar when I was applying to MIT. The program gives you incredible access to resources — networks, mentorship, advisors. Some of the top folks in our industry are advising us now on how to build our company. It’s really unique. These are folks who have done what you’re doing 10 or 20 years ago, all just rooting for you. That’s why I came to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence models that turn text into images are also useful for generating new materials. Over the last few years, generative materials models from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have drawn on their training data to help researchers design tens of millions of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to designing materials with exotic quantum properties like superconductivity or unique magnetic states, those models struggle. That’s too bad, because humans could use the help. For example, after a decade of research into a class of materials that could revolutionize quantum computing, called quantum spin liquids, only a dozen material candidates have been identified. The bottleneck means there are fewer materials to serve as the basis for technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a technique that lets popular generative materials models create promising quantum materials by following specific design rules. The rules, or constraints, steer models to create materials with unique structures that give rise to quantum properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The models from these large companies generate materials optimized for stability,” says Mingda Li, MIT’s Class of 1947 Career Development Professor. “Our perspective is that’s not usually how materials science advances. We don’t need 10 million new materials to change the world. We just need one really good material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is described today in a paper published by &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties. From that pool, they synthesized two actual materials with exotic magnetic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People in the quantum community really care about these geometric constraints, like the Kagome lattices that are two overlapping, upside-down triangles. We created materials with Kagome lattices because those materials can mimic the behavior of rare earth elements, so they are of high technical importance.” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li is the senior author of the paper. His MIT co-authors include PhD students Ryotaro Okabe,&amp;nbsp;Mouyang Cheng, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, and Denisse Cordova Carrizales; postdoc Manasi Mandal; undergraduate researchers Kiran Mak and Bowen Yu; visiting scholar Nguyen Tuan Hung; Xiang Fu ’22, PhD ’24; and professor of electrical engineering and computer science Tommi Jaakkola, who is an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. Additional co-authors include Yao Wang of Emory University, Weiwei Xie of Michigan State University, YQ Cheng of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Robert Cava of Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering models toward impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A material’s properties are determined by its structure, and quantum materials are no different. Certain atomic structures are more likely to give rise to exotic quantum properties than others. For instance, square lattices can serve as a platform for high-temperature superconductors, while other shapes known as Kagome and Lieb lattices can support the creation of materials that could be useful for quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help a popular class of generative models known as a diffusion models produce materials that conform to particular geometric patterns, the researchers created SCIGEN (short for Structural Constraint Integration in GENerative model). SCIGEN is a computer code that ensures diffusion models adhere to user-defined constraints at each iterative generation step. With SCIGEN, users can give any generative AI diffusion model geometric structural rules to follow as it generates materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diffusion models work by sampling from their training dataset to generate structures that reflect the distribution of structures found in the dataset. SCIGEN blocks generations that don’t align with the structural rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test SCIGEN, the researchers applied it to a popular AI materials generation model known as DiffCSP. They had the SCIGEN-equipped model generate materials with unique geometric patterns known as Archimedean lattices, which are collections of 2D lattice tilings of different polygons. Archimedean lattices can lead to a range of quantum phenomena and have been the focus of much research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Archimedean lattices give rise to quantum spin liquids and so-called flat bands, which can mimic the properties of rare earths without rare earth elements, so they are extremely important,” says Cheng, a co-corresponding author of the work. “Other Archimedean lattice materials have large pores that could be used for carbon capture and other applications, so it’s a collection of special materials. In some cases, there are no known materials with that lattice, so I think it will be really interesting to find the first material that fits in that lattice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model generated over 10 million material candidates with Archimedean lattices. One million of those materials survived a screening for stability. Using the supercomputers in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the researchers then took a smaller sample of 26,000 materials and ran detailed simulations to understand how the materials’ underlying atoms behaved. The researchers found magnetism in 41 percent of those structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that subset, the researchers synthesized two previously undiscovered compounds, TiPdBi and TiPbSb, at Xie and Cava’s labs. Subsequent experiments showed the AI model’s predictions largely aligned with the actual material’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to discover new materials that could have a huge potential impact by incorporating these structures that have been known to give rise to quantum properties,” says Okabe, the paper’s first author. “We already know that these materials with specific geometric patterns are interesting, so it’s natural to start with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating material breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum spin liquids could unlock quantum computing by enabling stable, error-resistant qubits that serve as the basis of quantum operations. But no quantum spin liquid materials have been confirmed. Xie and Cava believe SCIGEN could accelerate the search for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big search for quantum computer materials and topological superconductors, and these are all related to the geometric patterns of materials,” Xie says. “But experimental progress has been very, very slow,” Cava adds. “Many of these quantum spin liquid materials are subject to constraints: They have to be in a triangular lattice or a Kagome lattice. If the materials satisfy those constraints, the quantum researchers get excited; it’s a necessary but not sufficient condition. So, by generating many, many materials like that, it immediately gives experimentalists hundreds or thousands more candidates to play with to accelerate quantum computer materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work presents a new tool, leveraging machine learning, that can predict which materials will have specific elements in a desired geometric pattern,” says Drexel University Professor Steve May, who was not involved in the research. “This should speed up the development of previously unexplored materials for applications in next-generation electronic, magnetic, or optical technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that experimentation is still critical to assess whether AI-generated materials can be synthesized and how their actual properties compare with model predictions. Future work on SCIGEN could incorporate additional design rules into generative models, including chemical and functional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who want to change the world care about material properties more than the stability and structure of materials,” Okabe says. “With our approach, the ratio of stable materials goes down, but it opens the door to generate a whole bunch of promising materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the National Science Foundation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

Subsequent experiments showed the AI model’s predictions largely aligned with the actual material’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to discover new materials that could have a huge potential impact by incorporating these structures that have been known to give rise to quantum properties,” says Okabe, the paper’s first author. “We already know that these materials with specific geometric patterns are interesting, so it’s natural to start with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating material breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum spin liquids could unlock quantum computing by enabling stable, error-resistant qubits that serve as the basis of quantum operations. But no quantum spin liquid materials have been confirmed. Xie and Cava believe SCIGEN could accelerate the search for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big search for quantum computer materials and topological superconductors, and these are all related to the geometric patterns of materials,” Xie says. “But experimental progress has been very, very slow,” Cava adds. “Many of these quantum spin liquid materials are subject to constraints: They have to be in a triangular lattice or a Kagome lattice. If the materials satisfy those constraints, the quantum researchers get excited; it’s a necessary but not sufficient condition. So, by generating many, many materials like that, it immediately gives experimentalists hundreds or thousands more candidates to play with to accelerate quantum computer materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work presents a new tool, leveraging machine learning, that can predict which materials will have specific elements in a desired geometric pattern,” says Drexel University Professor Steve May, who was not involved in the research. “This should speed up the development of previously unexplored materials for applications in next-generation electronic, magnetic, or optical technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that experimentation is still critical to assess whether AI-generated materials can be synthesized and how their actual properties compare with model predictions. Future work on SCIGEN could incorporate additional design rules into generative models, including chemical and functional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who want to change the world care about material properties more than the stability and structure of materials,” Okabe says. “With our approach, the ratio of stable materials goes down, but it opens the door to generate a whole bunch of promising materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the National Science Foundation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

To your surprise, they schedule you in for the next day. At the appointment, you aren’t rushed through describing your health concerns; instead, you have a full half hour to share your symptoms and worries and the exhaustive details of your health history with someone who listens attentively and asks thoughtful follow-up questions. You leave with a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and the sense that, for once, you’ve been able to discuss your health with the care that it merits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The catch? You might not have spoken to a doctor, or other licensed medical practitioner, at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the new reality for patients at a small number of clinics in Southern California that are run by the medical startup Akido Labs. These patients—some of whom are on Medicaid—can access specialist appointments on short notice, a privilege typically only afforded to the wealthy few who patronize concierge clinics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The key difference is that Akido patients spend relatively little time, or even no time at all, with their doctors. Instead, they see a medical assistant, who can lend a sympathetic ear but has limited clinical training. The job of formulating diagnoses and concocting a treatment plan is done by a proprietary, LLM-based system called ScopeAI that transcribes and analyzes the dialogue between patient and assistant. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,” says Jared Goodner, Akido’s CTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to Prashant Samant, Akido’s CEO, this approach allows doctors to see four to five times as many patients as they could previously. There’s good reason to want doctors to be much more productive. Americans are getting older and sicker, and many struggle to access adequate health care. The pending 15% reduction in federal funding for Medicaid will only make the situation worse.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But experts aren’t convinced that displacing so much of the cognitive work of medicine onto AI is the right way to remedy the doctor shortage. There’s a big gap in expertise between doctors and AI-enhanced medical assistants, says Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley.&amp;nbsp; Jumping such a gap may introduce risks. “I am broadly excited about the potential of AI to expand access to medical expertise,” she says. “It’s just not obvious to me that this particular way is the way to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI is already everywhere in medicine. Computer vision tools identify cancers during preventive scans, automated research systems allow doctors to quickly sort through the medical literature, and LLM-powered medical scribes can take appointment notes on a clinician’s behalf. But these systems are designed to support doctors as they go about their typical medical routines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What distinguishes ScopeAI, Goodner says, is its ability to independently complete the cognitive tasks that constitute a medical visit, from eliciting a patient’s medical history to coming up with a list of potential diagnoses to identifying the most likely diagnosis and proposing appropriate next steps.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, ScopeAI is a set of large language models, each of which can perform a specific step in the visit—from generating appropriate follow-up questions based on what a patient has said to to populating a list of likely conditions. For the most part, these LLMs are fine-tuned versions of Meta’s open-access Llama models, though Goodner says that the system also makes use of Anthropic’s Claude models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the appointment, assistants read off questions from the ScopeAI interface, and ScopeAI produces new questions as it analyzes what the patient says. For the doctors who will review its outputs later, ScopeAI produces a concise note that includes a summary of the patient’s visit, the most likely diagnosis, two or three alternative diagnoses, and recommended next steps, such as referrals or prescriptions. It also lists a justification for each diagnosis and recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ScopeAI is currently being used in cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care clinics and by Akido’s street medicine team, which serves the Los Angeles homeless population. That team—which is led by Steven Hochman, a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine—meets patients out in the community to help them access medical care, including treatment for substance use disorders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Previously, in order to prescribe a drug to treat an opioid addiction, Hochman would have to meet the patient in person; now, caseworkers armed with ScopeAI can interview patients on their own, and Hochman can approve or reject the system’s recommendations later. “It allows me to be in 10 places at once,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since they started using ScopeAI, the team has been able to get patients access to medications to help treat their substance use within 24 hours—something that Hochman calls “unheard of.”&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;This arrangement is only possible because homeless patients typically get their health insurance from Medicaid, the public insurance system for low-income Americans. While Medicaid allows doctors to approve ScopeAI prescriptions and treatment plans asynchronously, both for street medicine and clinic visits, many other insurance providers require that doctors speak directly with patients before approving those recommendations. Pierson says that discrepancy raises concerns. “You worry about that exacerbating health disparities,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Samant is aware of the appearance of inequity, and he says the discrepancy isn’t intentional—it’s just a feature of how the insurance plans currently work. He also notes that being seen quickly by an AI-enhanced medical assistant may be better than dealing with long wait times and limited provider availability, which is the status quo for Medicaid patients. And all Akido patients can opt for traditional doctor’s appointments, if they are willing to wait for them, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of deploying a tool like ScopeAI is navigating a regulatory and insurance landscape that wasn’t designed for AI systems that can independently direct medical appointments. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, says that any AI system that effectively acts as a “doctor in a box” would likely need to be approved by the FDA and could run afoul of medical licensure laws, which dictate that only doctors and other licensed professionals can practice medicine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The California Medical Practice Act says that AI can't replace a doctor’s responsibility to diagnose and treat a patient, but doctors are allowed to use AI in their work, and they don’t need to see patients in-person or in real-time before diagnosing them. Neither the FDA nor the Medical Board of California were able to say whether or not ScopeAI was on solid legal footing based only on a written description of the system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Samant is confident that Akido is in compliance, as ScopeAI was intentionally designed to fall short of being a “doctor in a box.” Because the system requires a human doctor to review and approve of all of its diagnostic and treatment recommendations, he says, it doesn’t require FDA approval.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the clinic, this delicate balance between AI and doctor decision making happens entirely behind the scenes. Patients don’t ever see the ScopeAI interface directly—instead, they speak with a medical assistant who asks questions in the way that a doctor might in a typical appointment. That arrangement might make patients feel more comfortable. But Zeke Emanuel, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who served in the Obama and Biden administrations, worries that this comfort could be obscuring from patients the extent to which an algorithm is influencing their care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pierson agrees. “That certainly isn’t really what was traditionally meant by the human touch in medicine,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;DeAndre Siringoringo, a medical assistant who works at Akido’s cardiology office in Rancho Cucamonga, says that while he tells the patients he works with that an AI system will be listening to the appointment in order to gather information for their doctor, he doesn’t inform them about the specifics of how ScopeAI works, including the fact that it makes diagnostic recommendations to doctors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Because all ScopeAI recommendations are reviewed by a doctor, that might not seem like such a big deal—it’s the doctor who makes the final diagnosis, not the AI. But it’s been widely documented that doctors using AI systems tend to go along with the system’s recommendations more often than they should, a phenomenon known as automation bias.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s impossible to know whether automation bias is affecting doctors’ decisions at Akido clinics, though Pierson says it’s a risk—especially when doctors aren’t physically present for appointments. “I worry that it might predispose you to sort of nodding along in a way that you might not if you were actually in the room watching this happen,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;An Akido spokesperson says that automation bias is a valid concern for any AI tool that assists a doctor’s decision-making and that the company has made efforts to mitigate that bias. “We designed ScopeAI specifically to reduce bias by proactively countering blind spots that can influence medical decisions, which historically lean heavily on physician intuition and personal experience,” she says. “We also train physicians explicitly on how to use ScopeAI thoughtfully, so they retain accountability and avoid over-reliance.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Akido evaluates ScopeAI’s performance by testing it on historical data and monitoring how often doctors correct its recommendations; those corrections are also used to further train the underlying models. Before deploying ScopeAI in a given specialty, Akido ensures that when tested on historical data sets, the system includes the correct diagnosis in its top three recommendations at least 92% of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Akido hasn’t undertaken more rigorous testing, such as studies that compare ScopeAI appointments with traditional in-person or telehealth appointments, in order to determine whether the system improves—or at least maintains—patient outcomes. Such a study could help indicate whether automation bias is a meaningful concern.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Making medical care cheaper and more accessible is a laudable goal,” Pierson says. “But I just think it’s important to conduct strong evaluations comparing to that baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stethoscope-ai2.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You’ve been feeling unwell, so you call up your doctor’s office to make an appointment.

The deal is the latest to illustrate just how much investment Commonwealth and other fusion companies are courting as they attempt to take fusion power from the lab to the power grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is showing in concrete terms that people that use large amounts of energy, that know the energy market—they want fusion power, and they’re willing to contract for it and to pay for it,” said Bob Mumgaard, cofounder and CEO of Commonwealth, on a press call about the deal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth’s first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. Investment in the company represents nearly one-third of the total global investment in private fusion companies. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eni has invested in Commonwealth since 2018 and participated in the latest fundraising round. The vast majority of the company’s business is in oil and gas, but in recent years it’s made investments in technologies like biofuels and renewables.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“A company like us—we cannot stay and wait for things to happen,” says Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, research and development, and digital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked about it on the press call, Fiorillo referenced wind and solar plants that Eni owns and said the plan “is not different from what we do in other areas in the US and the world.” (Eni sells electricity from power plants that it owns, including renewable and fossil fuel plants.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commonwealth is building tokamak fusion reactors that use superconducting magnets to hold plasma in place.

That facility should begin construction in 2027 or 2028 and generate electricity for the grid in the early 2030s, Mumgaard says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite the billions of dollars Commonwealth has already raised, the company still needs more money to build its Arc power plant—that will be a multibillion-dollar project, Mumgaard said on a press call in August about the company’s latest fundraising round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The latest commitment from Eni could help Commonwealth secure the funding it needs to get Arc built. “These agreements are a really good way to create the right environment for building up more investment,” says Paul Wilson, chair of the department of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though commercial fusion energy is still years away at a minimum, investors and big tech companies have pumped money into the industry and signed agreements to buy power from plants once they’re operational.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Helion, another leading fusion startup, has plans to produce electricity from its first reactor in 2028 (an aggressive timeline that has some experts expressing skepticism). That facility will have a full generating capacity of 50 megawatts, and in 2023 Microsoft signed an agreement to purchase energy from the facility in order to help power its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As billions of dollars pour into the fusion industry, there are still many milestones ahead. To date, only the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has demonstrated that a fusion reactor can generate more energy than the amount put into the reaction. No commercial project has achieved that yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of capital going out now to these startup companies,” says Ed Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. “What I’m not seeing is a peer-reviewed scientific article that makes me feel like, boy, we really turned the corner with the physics.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But others are taking major commercial deals from Commonwealth and others as reasons to be optimistic. “Fusion is moving from the lab to be a proper industry,” says Sehila Gonzalez de Vicente, global director of fusion energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. “This is very good for the whole sector to be perceived as a real source of energy.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CFS-ARC-Facility-Aerial-illustration.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eni, one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, just agreed to buy $1 billion in electricity from a power plant being built by Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. Investment in the company represents nearly one-third of the total global investment in private fusion companies. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eni has invested in Commonwealth since 2018 and participated in the latest fundraising round. The vast majority of the company’s business is in oil and gas, but in recent years it’s made investments in technologies like biofuels and renewables.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“A company like us—we cannot stay and wait for things to happen,” says Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni’s director of technology, research and development, and digital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked about it on the press call, Fiorillo referenced wind and solar plants that Eni owns and said the plan “is not different from what we do in other areas in the US and the world.” (Eni sells electricity from power plants that it owns, including renewable and fossil fuel plants.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commonwealth is building tokamak fusion reactors that use superconducting magnets to hold plasma in place.

As a CIO.com article from July postulates, some experts see the orchestration function as ‘the point when agents become agentic.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where BMC sees an opportunity with its Control-M platform, which enables organisations to automate the scheduling and processing of business workflows across various platforms and applications from a single point of control. Last month BMC was named as a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for service orchestration and automation platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMC sees Control-M, in the words of director of solutions marketing Basil Faruqui, as the ‘orchestrator of orchestrators’, connecting multiple tools together. Faruqui predicts that, potentially within 12 months to two years, this orchestration will move from applications and APIs to agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, for example, has Agentforce, which it calls a ‘digital labour platform’, enabling companies visibility and control in scaling AI agents; and for Faruqui, that is where the puck is going. “Whether it’s a data warehouse, whether it’s a CRM like Salesforce or SAP, all of these things will be automating their functions using agentic AI,” he says. “[The orchestrator’s role] is going to change; it’s going to be automating and connecting agents across systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s really where we see our future in this ‘agent economy’, so to speak,” adds Faruqui. “We see Control-M playing the role of, really, being the orchestrator of agents across systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faruqui notes a recent meeting with the CTO of a major healthcare organisation, processing north of $10 billion each month in claims, in which they said initial testing of gen AI and LLMs was ‘transformative’. Applying gen AI to claims processing could cut down time of operations in ‘orders of magnitude.’ But as Faruqui puts it, technology for an enterprise is only producing value once it’s running in production – and operational and governance challenges remain a principal barrier. Orchestration therefore helps bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another positive Faruqui, who is speaking at AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Europe later this month, notes is the breadth and depth of investment in this space. “[For] sponsorship, a lot of these projects are not at the CIO or CTO level. It’s really coming from the board,” he says. “We’re actually seeing, in some cases, that companies are starting to report on the progress of their AI initiatives in their letter to the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is going to move fast, which means that, from the vendor side we have to be ready, not in three years, [but] six months,” says Faruqui. “And we in BMC, we are working through a very bold vision where we see this agent economy really taking off; and really, orchestration is the vehicle for business outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the full conversation with Basil&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basil Faruqui is speaking at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, in Amsterdam on September 24-25, on the panel session ‘Building Robust Pipelines-Best Practices for Scalability and Efficiency’. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register your place today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-62-1024x573.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI is, in the opinion of McKinsey, the way to ‘break out of the gen AI paradox.’ &amp;nbsp;Nearly four in five companies are using generative AI, according to the consultancy giant’s research, but comparatively few are getting any bottom-line value from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question of value, therefore, may be in orchestration.

Instead, they see a medical assistant, who can lend a sympathetic ear but has limited clinical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job of formulating diagnoses and concocting a treatment plan is done by an LLM-based system called ScopeAI that transcribes and analyzes the dialogue between patient and assistant. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Akido’s CEO, this approach allows doctors to see four to five times as many patients as they could previously. But experts aren’t convinced that displacing so much of the cognitive work of medicine onto AI is the right way to remedy the doctor shortage.

Instead, they see a medical assistant, who can lend a sympathetic ear but has limited clinical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job of formulating diagnoses and concocting a treatment plan is done by an LLM-based system called ScopeAI that transcribes and analyzes the dialogue between patient and assistant. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Akido’s CEO, this approach allows doctors to see four to five times as many patients as they could previously. But experts aren’t convinced that displacing so much of the cognitive work of medicine onto AI is the right way to remedy the doctor shortage.

The deal is the latest to illustrate just how much investment Commonwealth and other fusion companies are courting as they attempt to take fusion power from the lab to the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth’s first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
