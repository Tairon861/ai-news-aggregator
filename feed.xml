The issue that we’re trying to help merchants think through is how to do all of this as low-touch as possible while using the infrastructure you already have without doing a bazillion integrations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added AI shopping would also bring about “a resurgence from consumers trying to ensure their investment is protected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal partnered with website builder &lt;a href="https://www.wix.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wix&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cym.bio/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cymbio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Commerce and &lt;a href="https://shopware.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shopware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to bring products to chat platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Perplexity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Agent-powered shopping &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal’s Agentic Commerce Services include two features. The first is Agent Ready, which would allow existing PayPal merchants to accept payments on AI platforms. The second is called Shop Sync, which will enable companies’ product data to be discoverable through different AI chat interfaces. It takes a company’s catalog information and plug its inventory and fulfillment data to chat platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill said the data goes into a central repository where AI models can ingest the information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, companies can access shop sync with Agent Ready coming in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill said Agentic Commerce Services is a one-to-many solution, that would be helpful right now, as different LLMs scrape different data sources to surface information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast integration with current and future partners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More product discovery over the traditional search, browse and cart experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preserved customer insights and relationships where the brand continues to have control over their records and communications with customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the service is only available through Perplexity, but Gill said more platforms will be added soon. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fragmented AI platforms &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Agentic commerce is still very much in the early stages. AI agents are just beginning to get better at reading a browser. while platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity can now surface products and services based on user queries, people cannot technically buy things from chat yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a race right now to create a standard to enable agents to transact on behalf of users and pay for items. Other than Google’s AP2, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stripe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have the &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-debuts-new-chatgpt-buy-button-and-open-source-agentic-commerce"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://usa.visa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Visa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched its &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-just-launched-a-protocol-to-secure-the-ai-shopping-boom-heres-what-it"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trusted Agent Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than enabling a trust layer for agents to transact, another issue enterprises face with agentic commerce is fragmentation. Different chat platforms use different models which also interpret information in slightly different ways. Gill said PayPal learned that when it comes to working with merchants, flexibility is important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you decide if you&amp;#x27;re going to spend your time integrating with Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT or Perplexity? And each one of them right now has a different protocol, a different catalog, config, a different everything. That is a lot of time to make a bet as to like where you should spend your time,” Gill said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI announced the promotion but did not specify how long the offer would remain available. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month plan, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Priced at less than $5 per month, ChatGPT Go launched in India in August as OpenAI’s most affordable paid subscription plan. The service later expanded to Indonesia and, earlier this month, to 16 additional countries across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India, the world’s most populous country with over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, has been a key market for OpenAI. The company opened its New Delhi office in August and is currently building a local team to expand its presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said India was the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. However, making money from ChatGPT’s paid plans in the country has proven challenging. The app saw over 29 million downloads in the 90 days leading up to August, but generated just $3.6 million in in-app purchases during that period, according to Appfigures data reviewed by TechCrunch at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT Go offers 10 times more usage than the free version for generating responses, creating images, and uploading files. It also features improved memory for more personalized responses, according to OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we’ve seen from our users has been inspiring,” said Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, in a statement. “We’re excited to see the amazing things our users will build, learn, and achieve with these tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s rivals, including Perplexity and Google, are also looking to tap into India’s large and youthful user base. Perplexity recently partnered with Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to the telecom operator’s 360 million subscribers. Similarly, Google introduced a free one-year AI Pro plan for students in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is set to host its DevDay Exchange developer conference Bengaluru on November 4, where it is expected to make India-specific announcements aimed at local developers and enterprises. India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets for ChatGPT, with millions of users engaging with the chatbot daily, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs, the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to &lt;em&gt;perhaps not&lt;/em&gt; go all in on AI were nowhere to be found. Or, at least, none that were willing to admit it. What gives?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are several interpretations of this one reporter’s quest (which, for the record, I’m presenting as an anecdote and not a representation of the economy), but let’s start with the easy ones. First is that this is a huge score for the “AI is a bubble” believers. What is a bubble if not a situation where companies continue to spend relentlessly even in the face of worrying news? The other is that underneath the bad headlines, there’s not enough genuinely troubling news about AI to convince companies they should pivot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it could also be that the unbelievable speed of AI progress and adoption has made me think industries are more sensitive to news than they perhaps should be. I spoke with Martha Gimbel, who leads the Yale Budget Lab and coauthored a report finding that AI has not yet changed anyone’s jobs. What I gathered is that Gimbel, like many economists, thinks on a longer time scale than anyone in the AI world is used to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It would be historically shocking if a technology had had an impact as quickly as people thought that this one was going to,” she says. In other words, perhaps most of the economy is still figuring out what the hell AI even does, not deciding whether to abandon it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other reaction I heard—particularly from the consultant crowd—is that when executives hear that so many AI pilots are failing, they indeed take it very seriously. They’re just not reading it as a failure of the technology itself. They instead point to pilots not moving quickly enough, companies lacking the right data to build better AI, or a host of other strategic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if there is incredible pressure, especially on public companies, to invest heavily in AI, a few have taken big swings on the technology only to pull back. The buy now, pay later company Klarna laid off staff and paused hiring in 2024, claiming it could use AI instead. Less than a year later it was hiring again, explaining that “AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drive-throughs, from McDonald’s to Taco Bell, ended pilots testing the use of AI voice assistants. The vast majority of Coca-Cola advertisements, according to experts I spoke with, are not made with generative AI, despite the company’s $1 billion promise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So for now, the question remains unanswered: Are there companies out there rethinking how much their bets on AI will pay off, or when? And if there are, what’s keeping them from talking out loud about it?

First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs, the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to &lt;em&gt;perhaps not&lt;/em&gt; go all in on AI were nowhere to be found. Or, at least, none that were willing to admit it. What gives?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are several interpretations of this one reporter’s quest (which, for the record, I’m presenting as an anecdote and not a representation of the economy), but let’s start with the easy ones. First is that this is a huge score for the “AI is a bubble” believers. What is a bubble if not a situation where companies continue to spend relentlessly even in the face of worrying news? The other is that underneath the bad headlines, there’s not enough genuinely troubling news about AI to convince companies they should pivot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it could also be that the unbelievable speed of AI progress and adoption has made me think industries are more sensitive to news than they perhaps should be. I spoke with Martha Gimbel, who leads the Yale Budget Lab and coauthored a report finding that AI has not yet changed anyone’s jobs. What I gathered is that Gimbel, like many economists, thinks on a longer time scale than anyone in the AI world is used to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It would be historically shocking if a technology had had an impact as quickly as people thought that this one was going to,” she says. In other words, perhaps most of the economy is still figuring out what the hell AI even does, not deciding whether to abandon it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other reaction I heard—particularly from the consultant crowd—is that when executives hear that so many AI pilots are failing, they indeed take it very seriously. They’re just not reading it as a failure of the technology itself. They instead point to pilots not moving quickly enough, companies lacking the right data to build better AI, or a host of other strategic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if there is incredible pressure, especially on public companies, to invest heavily in AI, a few have taken big swings on the technology only to pull back. The buy now, pay later company Klarna laid off staff and paused hiring in 2024, claiming it could use AI instead. Less than a year later it was hiring again, explaining that “AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drive-throughs, from McDonald’s to Taco Bell, ended pilots testing the use of AI voice assistants. The vast majority of Coca-Cola advertisements, according to experts I spoke with, are not made with generative AI, despite the company’s $1 billion promise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So for now, the question remains unanswered: Are there companies out there rethinking how much their bets on AI will pay off, or when? And if there are, what’s keeping them from talking out loud about it?

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Paypal is adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open-source specification developed by OpenAI that lets merchants make their products available within AI apps, consequently enabling users to shop using AI agents. Meanwhile OpenAI’s “Instant Checkout” feature, launched in September, lets users confirm their order, shipping, and payment details, and complete purchases without leaving ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Customers can use their Paypal wallets for checkout, which, the company said, would enable it to provide buyer and seller protection, as well as dispute resolution. The company is also providing technology to handle card payments from within ChatGPT using a separate payments API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And next year, merchants using Paypal products will have their products be discoverable on ChatGPT, starting with categories like apparel, fashion, beauty, home improvement and electronics. Merchants will not need to build any integrations, as PayPal will handle merchant routing and payments behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is also launching an agentic commerce suite that would let merchants feature their catalogs within AI apps, accept payments on different AI apps, and get insights about consumer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PayPal has been working to insert itself as a payments partner within various companies’ AI-enabled shopping experiences, particularly as people increasingly use AI apps to do their daily tasks. In May, the company teamed up with Perplexity to let users checkout within the AI search tool, and in September, Paypal said it was adopting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol to integrate its products within various Google products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PayPal said, apart from the partnership on commerce, the company is giving enterprise access to ChatGPT to all of its employees and allowing its engineers to make better use of OpenAI’s coding tools, Codex.&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, he thinks that the industry is taking AI in a dangerous direction by building chatbots that present as human: He worries that people will be tricked into seeing life instead of lifelike behavior. In August, he published a much-discussed post on his personal blog that urged his peers to stop trying to make what he called “seemingly conscious artificial intelligence,” or SCAI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Suleyman runs a product shop that must compete with those peers. Last week, Microsoft announced a string of updates to its Copilot chatbot, designed to boost its appeal in a crowded market in which customers can pick and choose between a pantheon of rival bots that already includes ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I talked to Suleyman about the tension at play when it comes to designing our interactions with chatbots and his ultimate vision for what this new technology should be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key Copilot update is a group-chat feature that lets multiple people talk to the chatbot at the same time. A big part of the idea seems to be to stop people from falling down a rabbit hole in a one-on-one conversation with a yes-man bot. Another feature, called Real Talk, lets people tailor how much Copilot pushes back on you, dialing down the sycophancy so that the chatbot challenges what you say more often.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Copilot also got a memory upgrade, so that it can now remember your upcoming events or long-term goals and bring up things that you told it in past conversations. And then there’s Mico, an animated yellow blob—a kind of Chatbot Clippy—that Microsoft hopes will make Copilot more accessible and engaging for new and younger users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft says the updates were designed to make Copilot more expressive, engaging, and helpful. But I’m curious how far those features can be pushed without starting down the SCAI path that Suleyman has warned about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Suleyman’s concerns about SCAI come at a time when we are starting to hear more and more stories about people being led astray by chatbots that are too engaging, too expressive, too helpful. OpenAI is being sued by the parents of a teenager who they allege was talked into killing himself by ChatGPT. There’s even a growing scene that celebrates romantic relationships with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, I wanted to dig a bit deeper into Suleyman’s views. Because a couple of years ago he gave a TED Talk in which he told us that the best way to think about AI is as a new kind of digital species. Doesn’t that kind of hype feed the misperceptions Suleyman is now concerned about?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In our conversation, Suleyman told me what he was trying to get across in that TED Talk, why he really believes SCAI is a problem, and why Microsoft would never build sex robots (his words). He had a lot of answers, but he left me with more questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an ideal world, what kind of chatbot do you want to build? You’ve just launched a bunch of updates to Copilot. How do you get the balance right when you’re building a chatbot that has to compete in a market in which people seem to value humanlike interaction, but you also say you want to avoid seemingly conscious AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a good question. With group chat, this will be the first time that a large group of people will be able to speak to an AI at the same time. It really is a way of emphasizing that AIs shouldn’t be drawing you out of the real world. They should be helping you to connect, to bring in your family, your friends, to have community groups, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is going to become a very significant differentiator over the next few years. My vision of AI has always been one where an AI is on your team, in your corner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a very simple, obvious statement, but it isn’t about exceeding and replacing humanity—it’s about serving us. That should be the test of technology at every step. Does it actually, you know, deliver on the quest of civilization, which is to make us smarter and happier and more productive and healthier and stuff like that?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So we’re just trying to build features that constantly remind us to ask that question, and remind our users to push us on that issue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last time we spoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, you told me that you weren’t interested in making a chatbot that would role-play personalities. That’s not true of the wider industry. Elon Musk’s Grok is selling that kind of flirty experience. OpenAI has said it’s interested in exploring new adult interactions with ChatGPT. There’s a market for that. And yet this is something you’ll just stay clear of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah, we will never build sex robots. Sad in a way that we have to be so clear about that, but that’s just not our mission as a company. The joy of being at Microsoft is that for 50 years, the company has built, you know, software to empower people, to put people first.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as a result, that means the company moves slower than other startups and is more deliberate and more careful. But I think that’s a feature, not a bug, in this age, when being attentive to potential side effects and longer-term consequences is really important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that means what, exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re very clear on, you know, trying to create an AI that fosters a meaningful relationship. It’s not that it’s trying to be cold and anodyne—it cares about being fluid and lucid and kind. It definitely has some emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So where does it—where do you—draw those boundaries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our newest chat model, which is called Real Talk, is a little bit more sassy. It’s a bit more cheeky, it’s a bit more fun, it’s quite philosophical. It’ll happily talk about the big-picture questions, the meaning of life, and so on. But if you try and flirt with it, it’ll push back and it’ll be very clear—not in a judgmental way, but just, like: “Look, that’s not for me.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are other places where you can go to get that kind of experience, right? And I think that’s just a decision we’ve made as a company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a no-flirting policy enough? Because if the idea is to stop people even imagining an entity, a consciousness, behind the interactions, you could still get that with a chatbot that wanted to keep things SFW. You know, I can imagine some people seeing something that’s not there even with a personality that’s saying, hey, let’s keep this professional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Here’s a metaphor to try to make sense of it. We hold each other accountable in the workplace. There’s an entire architecture of boundary management, which essentially sculpts human behavior to fit a mold that’s functional and not irritating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true in our personal lives. The way that you interact with your third cousin is very different to the way you interact with your sibling. There’s a lot to learn from how we manage boundaries in real human interactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be either a complete open book of emotional sensuality or availability—drawing people into a spiraled rabbit hole of intensity—or, like, a cold dry thing. There’s a huge spectrum in between, and the craft that we’re learning as an industry and as a species is to sculpt these attributes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And those attributes obviously reflect the values of the companies that design them. And I think that’s where Microsoft has a lot of strengths, because our values are pretty clear, and that’s what we’re standing behind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of people seem to like personalities. Some of the backlash to GPT-5, for example, was because the previous model’s personality had been taken away. Was it a mistake for OpenAI to have put a strong personality there in the first place, to give people something that they then missed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No, personality is great. My point is that we’re trying to sculpt personality attributes in a more fine-grained way, right?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Like I said, Real Talk is a cool personality. It’s quite different to normal Copilot. We are also experimenting with Mico, which is this visual character, that, you know, people—some people—really love. It’s much more engaging. It’s easier to talk to about all kinds of emotional questions and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess this is what I’m trying to get straight. Features like Mico are meant to make Copilot more engaging and nicer to use, but it seems to go against the idea of doing whatever you can to stop people thinking there’s something there that you are actually having a friendship with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah. I mean, it doesn’t stop you necessarily. People want to talk to somebody, or something, that they like. And we know that if your teacher is nice to you at school, you’re going to be more engaged. The same with your manager, the same with your loved ones. And so emotional intelligence has always been a critical part of the puzzle, so it’s not to say that we don’t want to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s just that the craft is in trying to find that boundary. And there are some things which we’re saying are just off the table, and there are other things which we’re going to be more experimental with. Like, certain people have complained that they don’t get enough pushback from Copilot—they want it to be more challenging. Other people aren’t looking for that kind of experience—they want it to be a basic information provider. The task for us is just learning to disentangle what type of experience to give to different people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you’ve been thinking about how people engage with AI for some time. Was there an inciting incident that made you want to start this conversation in the industry about seemingly conscious AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I could see that there was a group of people emerging in the academic literature who were taking the question of moral consideration for artificial entities very seriously. And I think it’s very clear that if we start to do that, it would detract from the urgent need to protect the rights of many humans that already exist, let alone animals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you grant AI rights, that implies—you know—fundamental autonomy, and it implies that it might have free will to make its own decisions about things. So I’m really trying to frame a counter to that, which is that it won’t ever have free will. It won’t ever have complete autonomy like another human being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;AI will be able to take actions on our behalf. But these models are working for us. You wouldn’t want a pack of, you know, wolves wandering around that weren’t tame and that had complete freedom to go and compete with us for resources and weren’t accountable to humans. I mean, most people would think that was a bad idea and that you would want to go and kill the wolves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. So the idea is to stop some movement that’s calling for AI welfare or rights before it even gets going, by making sure that we don’t build AI that appears to be conscious? What about not building that kind of AI because certain vulnerable people may be tricked by it in a way that may be harmful? I mean, those seem to be two different concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the test is going to be in the kinds of features the different labs put out and in the types of personalities that they create. Then we’ll be able to see how that’s affecting human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it a concern of yours that we are building a technology that might trick people into seeing something that isn’t there? I mean, people have claimed they’ve seen sentience inside far less sophisticated models than we have now. Or is that just something that some people will always do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s possible. But my point is that a responsible developer has to do our best to try and detect these patterns emerging in people as quickly as possible and not take it for granted that people are going to be able to disentangle those kinds of experiences themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I read your post about seemingly conscious AI, I was struck by a line that says: “We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person.” It made me think of a TED Talk you gave last year where you say that the best way to think about AI is as a new kind of digital species. Can you help me understand why talking about this technology as a digital species isn’t a step down the path of thinking about AI models as digital persons or conscious entities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the difference is that I’m trying to offer metaphors that make it easier for people to understand where things might be headed, and therefore how to avert that and how to control it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not to say that we should do those things. It’s just pointing out that this is the emergence of a technology which is unique in human history. And if you just assume that it’s a tool or just a chatbot or a dumb— you know, I kind of wrote that TED Talk in the context of a lot of skepticism. And I think it’s important to be clear-eyed about what’s coming so that one can think about the right guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yet, if you’re telling me this technology is a new digital species, I have some sympathy for the people who say, well, then we need to consider welfare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t. &lt;em&gt;[He starts laughing.]&lt;/em&gt; Just not in the slightest. No way. It’s not a direction that any of us want to go in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, that’s not what I meant. I don’t think chatbots should have welfare. I’m saying I’d have some sympathy for where such people were coming from when they hear, you know, Mustafa Suleyman tell them that this thing he’s building was a new digital species. I’d understand why they might then say that they wanted to stand up for it. I’m saying the words we use matter, I guess.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rest of the TED Talk was all about how to contain AI and how not to let this species take over, right? That was the whole point of setting it up as, like, this is what's coming. I mean, that’s what my whole book [&lt;em&gt;The Coming Wave&lt;/em&gt;, published in 2023] was about—containment and alignment and stuff like that. There’s no point in pretending that it’s something that it’s not and then building guardrails and boundaries that don’t apply because you think it’s just a tool.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Honestly, it does have the potential to recursively self-improve. It does have the potential to set its own goals. Those are quite profound things. No other technology we’ve ever invented has that. And so, yeah, I think that it is accurate to say that it’s like a digital species, a new digital species. That’s what we’re trying to restrict to make sure it’s always in service of people. That’s the target for containment.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mustafa-Suleyman-Preferred-Headshot-Sept-2025.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, is trying to walk a fine line. On the one hand, he thinks that the industry is taking AI in a dangerous direction by building chatbots that present as human: He worries that people will be tricked into seeing life instead of lifelike behavior. In August, he published a much-discussed post on his personal blog that urged his peers to stop trying to make what he called “seemingly conscious artificial intelligence,” or SCAI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Suleyman runs a product shop that must compete with those peers. Last week, Microsoft announced a string of updates to its Copilot chatbot, designed to boost its appeal in a crowded market in which customers can pick and choose between a pantheon of rival bots that already includes ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I talked to Suleyman about the tension at play when it comes to designing our interactions with chatbots and his ultimate vision for what this new technology should be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One key Copilot update is a group-chat feature that lets multiple people talk to the chatbot at the same time. A big part of the idea seems to be to stop people from falling down a rabbit hole in a one-on-one conversation with a yes-man bot. Another feature, called Real Talk, lets people tailor how much Copilot pushes back on you, dialing down the sycophancy so that the chatbot challenges what you say more often.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Copilot also got a memory upgrade, so that it can now remember your upcoming events or long-term goals and bring up things that you told it in past conversations. And then there’s Mico, an animated yellow blob—a kind of Chatbot Clippy—that Microsoft hopes will make Copilot more accessible and engaging for new and younger users.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft says the updates were designed to make Copilot more expressive, engaging, and helpful. But I’m curious how far those features can be pushed without starting down the SCAI path that Suleyman has warned about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Suleyman’s concerns about SCAI come at a time when we are starting to hear more and more stories about people being led astray by chatbots that are too engaging, too expressive, too helpful. OpenAI is being sued by the parents of a teenager who they allege was talked into killing himself by ChatGPT. There’s even a growing scene that celebrates romantic relationships with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, I wanted to dig a bit deeper into Suleyman’s views. Because a couple of years ago he gave a TED Talk in which he told us that the best way to think about AI is as a new kind of digital species. Doesn’t that kind of hype feed the misperceptions Suleyman is now concerned about?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In our conversation, Suleyman told me what he was trying to get across in that TED Talk, why he really believes SCAI is a problem, and why Microsoft would never build sex robots (his words). He had a lot of answers, but he left me with more questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an ideal world, what kind of chatbot do you want to build? You’ve just launched a bunch of updates to Copilot. How do you get the balance right when you’re building a chatbot that has to compete in a market in which people seem to value humanlike interaction, but you also say you want to avoid seemingly conscious AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s a good question. With group chat, this will be the first time that a large group of people will be able to speak to an AI at the same time. It really is a way of emphasizing that AIs shouldn’t be drawing you out of the real world. They should be helping you to connect, to bring in your family, your friends, to have community groups, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is going to become a very significant differentiator over the next few years. My vision of AI has always been one where an AI is on your team, in your corner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a very simple, obvious statement, but it isn’t about exceeding and replacing humanity—it’s about serving us. That should be the test of technology at every step. Does it actually, you know, deliver on the quest of civilization, which is to make us smarter and happier and more productive and healthier and stuff like that?&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So we’re just trying to build features that constantly remind us to ask that question, and remind our users to push us on that issue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last time we spoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, you told me that you weren’t interested in making a chatbot that would role-play personalities. That’s not true of the wider industry. Elon Musk’s Grok is selling that kind of flirty experience. OpenAI has said it’s interested in exploring new adult interactions with ChatGPT. There’s a market for that. And yet this is something you’ll just stay clear of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah, we will never build sex robots. Sad in a way that we have to be so clear about that, but that’s just not our mission as a company. The joy of being at Microsoft is that for 50 years, the company has built, you know, software to empower people, to put people first.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as a result, that means the company moves slower than other startups and is more deliberate and more careful. But I think that’s a feature, not a bug, in this age, when being attentive to potential side effects and longer-term consequences is really important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that means what, exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We’re very clear on, you know, trying to create an AI that fosters a meaningful relationship. It’s not that it’s trying to be cold and anodyne—it cares about being fluid and lucid and kind. It definitely has some emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So where does it—where do you—draw those boundaries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our newest chat model, which is called Real Talk, is a little bit more sassy. It’s a bit more cheeky, it’s a bit more fun, it’s quite philosophical. It’ll happily talk about the big-picture questions, the meaning of life, and so on. But if you try and flirt with it, it’ll push back and it’ll be very clear—not in a judgmental way, but just, like: “Look, that’s not for me.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There are other places where you can go to get that kind of experience, right? And I think that’s just a decision we’ve made as a company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a no-flirting policy enough? Because if the idea is to stop people even imagining an entity, a consciousness, behind the interactions, you could still get that with a chatbot that wanted to keep things SFW. You know, I can imagine some people seeing something that’s not there even with a personality that’s saying, hey, let’s keep this professional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Here’s a metaphor to try to make sense of it. We hold each other accountable in the workplace. There’s an entire architecture of boundary management, which essentially sculpts human behavior to fit a mold that’s functional and not irritating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same is true in our personal lives. The way that you interact with your third cousin is very different to the way you interact with your sibling. There’s a lot to learn from how we manage boundaries in real human interactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be either a complete open book of emotional sensuality or availability—drawing people into a spiraled rabbit hole of intensity—or, like, a cold dry thing. There’s a huge spectrum in between, and the craft that we’re learning as an industry and as a species is to sculpt these attributes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And those attributes obviously reflect the values of the companies that design them. And I think that’s where Microsoft has a lot of strengths, because our values are pretty clear, and that’s what we’re standing behind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of people seem to like personalities. Some of the backlash to GPT-5, for example, was because the previous model’s personality had been taken away. Was it a mistake for OpenAI to have put a strong personality there in the first place, to give people something that they then missed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No, personality is great. My point is that we’re trying to sculpt personality attributes in a more fine-grained way, right?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Like I said, Real Talk is a cool personality. It’s quite different to normal Copilot. We are also experimenting with Mico, which is this visual character, that, you know, people—some people—really love. It’s much more engaging. It’s easier to talk to about all kinds of emotional questions and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess this is what I’m trying to get straight. Features like Mico are meant to make Copilot more engaging and nicer to use, but it seems to go against the idea of doing whatever you can to stop people thinking there’s something there that you are actually having a friendship with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah. I mean, it doesn’t stop you necessarily. People want to talk to somebody, or something, that they like. And we know that if your teacher is nice to you at school, you’re going to be more engaged. The same with your manager, the same with your loved ones. And so emotional intelligence has always been a critical part of the puzzle, so it’s not to say that we don’t want to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s just that the craft is in trying to find that boundary. And there are some things which we’re saying are just off the table, and there are other things which we’re going to be more experimental with. Like, certain people have complained that they don’t get enough pushback from Copilot—they want it to be more challenging. Other people aren’t looking for that kind of experience—they want it to be a basic information provider. The task for us is just learning to disentangle what type of experience to give to different people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you’ve been thinking about how people engage with AI for some time. Was there an inciting incident that made you want to start this conversation in the industry about seemingly conscious AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I could see that there was a group of people emerging in the academic literature who were taking the question of moral consideration for artificial entities very seriously. And I think it’s very clear that if we start to do that, it would detract from the urgent need to protect the rights of many humans that already exist, let alone animals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you grant AI rights, that implies—you know—fundamental autonomy, and it implies that it might have free will to make its own decisions about things. So I’m really trying to frame a counter to that, which is that it won’t ever have free will. It won’t ever have complete autonomy like another human being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;AI will be able to take actions on our behalf. But these models are working for us. You wouldn’t want a pack of, you know, wolves wandering around that weren’t tame and that had complete freedom to go and compete with us for resources and weren’t accountable to humans. I mean, most people would think that was a bad idea and that you would want to go and kill the wolves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. So the idea is to stop some movement that’s calling for AI welfare or rights before it even gets going, by making sure that we don’t build AI that appears to be conscious? What about not building that kind of AI because certain vulnerable people may be tricked by it in a way that may be harmful?

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most companies like to put AI assistants into a sidebar in their products to grab on-screen context. But for Express, Adobe has created a new mode that lets you use text prompts to create new images and designs. You can switch on the assistant mode to use AI prompts and then switch back to use editing tools and controls that are available in Express in the current version.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Photoshop assistant, which is in closed beta testing, lives in the sidebar. Adobe claims the assistant can understand different layers and help you automatically select objects and create masks. Adobe added that users can ask the assistant to complete repetitive tasks such as removing backgrounds or changing colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062943" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PhotoshopAIAssistant.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image credits: Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told TechCrunch that the company decided to build a different mode for its AI assistant in Express to target students and professionals who use the app. The company wants to see if users can achieve what they want to do without having to switch back to the traditional interface, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think this approach of switching between two modes, where you get the best of both worlds, is gonna make the technology both accessible and controllable,” Costin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is also experimenting with a new type of assistant, dubbed “Project Moonlight,” that can coordinate with different assistants from other Adobe tools, and connect to a creator’s social channels to better understand their style. Adobe said the product is in the early stages of development and is in private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustrative image showing prototypes of Adobe's new project of cross-app assistant is a system that gets data from all of its apps.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is also exploring a way to connect Adobe Express with ChatGPT using OpenAI’s app integrations API to let users create designs directly in ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe also announced a new set of AI features for its Creative Cloud apps. Photoshop users can now choose third-party models, like Google’s Gemini 2.5 flash and Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 Kontext, for the generative fill feature, which can remove objects or extend images. The company is also adding an AI-powered object mask in its video editing app, Premiere Pro, to let users easily identify and select objects or people to add effects or adjust colors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adobe today released new AI assistants Creative Cloud products, Express and Photoshop, that can help users with image creation and editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most companies like to put AI assistants into a sidebar in their products to grab on-screen context. But for Express, Adobe has created a new mode that lets you use text prompts to create new images and designs. You can switch on the assistant mode to use AI prompts and then switch back to use editing tools and controls that are available in Express in the current version.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Photoshop assistant, which is in closed beta testing, lives in the sidebar. Adobe claims the assistant can understand different layers and help you automatically select objects and create masks. Adobe added that users can ask the assistant to complete repetitive tasks such as removing backgrounds or changing colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062943" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PhotoshopAIAssistant.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image credits: Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe’s VP of generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told TechCrunch that the company decided to build a different mode for its AI assistant in Express to target students and professionals who use the app. The company wants to see if users can achieve what they want to do without having to switch back to the traditional interface, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think this approach of switching between two modes, where you get the best of both worlds, is gonna make the technology both accessible and controllable,” Costin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is also experimenting with a new type of assistant, dubbed “Project Moonlight,” that can coordinate with different assistants from other Adobe tools, and connect to a creator’s social channels to better understand their style. Adobe said the product is in the early stages of development and is in private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="An illustrative image showing prototypes of Adobe's new project of cross-app assistant is a system that gets data from all of its apps.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said it is also exploring a way to connect Adobe Express with ChatGPT using OpenAI’s app integrations API to let users create designs directly in ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

The company is also adding more features to the Firefly website, support for more third-party models, the ability to generate speech and soundtracks. Notably, the update allows artists to come up with their own image models using their existing art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Image 5 model can now work at native resolutions of up to 4 megapixels, a massive increase from the previous gen model, which could natively generate images at 1 megapixels but then would upscale them to 4 megapixels. The new model is also better at rendering humans, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062893" height="2048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FireflyImageModel5.jpeg?w=680" width="3840" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Image 5 also enables layered and prompt-based editing — the model treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. The company said it makes sure that when you edit these layers, the image’s details and integrity are not compromised.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe’s Firefly site has supported third-party models from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Runway, Topaz, and Flu to augment its appeal to its creative customer base, and now the company is taking that a step further by letting users  create custom models based on their art style. Currently in a closed beta, this feature lets users drag and drop assets, such as images, illustrations and sketches, to create a custom image model based on their style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also adding some new features to its Firefly website, which was redesigned earlier this year. The site now lets you use the prompt box to switch between generating images or videos, choose which AI model you want to work with, change aspect ratios, and more. The site’s home page now features your files and recent generation history, and you also get shortcuts to other Adobe apps (these were previously housed in a menu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Adobe has also redesigned the video generation and editing tool to support layers and timeline-based editing. This design change is currently only available in a private beta, and will be rolled out to users eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062895" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VideoEditor.jpg?w=544" width="544" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Firefly is also getting two new audio features: Users can now employ AI prompts to generate entire soundtracks and speech — using models from ElevenLabs — for videos. There’s also a new way to easily come up with prompts: just add keywords and sections by selecting words from a word cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As its competitors like Canva add AI to their platforms, Adobe is trying to cater to new-age creators who are increasingly using AI in their workflows. “We’re thinking of the target audience for Firefly as what we call creators or next-generation creative professionals. I think there are these emergent creatives that are GenAI-oriented. They love to use GenAI in all their workloads,” Alexandru Costin, the company’s VP of generative AI, told TechCrunch over a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that with Firefly, the company now has more freedom to add new features and play around with the interface as it doesn’t have to adhere to the muscle memory of creative professionals who might be used to certain workflows in Adobe’s existing Creative Cloud tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Adobe said on Tuesday that it is launching the latest iteration of its image generation model, Firefly Image 5.
