An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardizing on a transparent, Apache-licensed VAE supports auditability and compliance requirements, ensures consistent reconstruction quality across internal assets, and allows future models trained for the same latent space to function as drop-in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency also enables downstream customization such as lightweight fine-tuning for brand styles or internal visual templates—even for organizations that do not specialize in media but rely on consistent, controllable image generation for marketing materials, product imagery, documentation, or stock-style visuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement positions FLUX.2 as an evolution of the FLUX.1 family, with an emphasis on reliability, controllability, and integration into existing creative pipelines rather than one-off demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Shift Toward Production-Centric Image Models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 extends the prior FLUX.1 architecture with more consistent character, layout, and style adherence across up to ten reference images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system maintains coherence at 4-megapixel resolutions for both generation and editing tasks, enabling use cases such as product visualization, brand-aligned asset creation, and structured design workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also improves prompt following across multi-part instructions while reducing failure modes related to lighting, spatial logic, and world knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Black Forest Labs continues to follow an open-core release strategy. The company provides hosted, performance-optimized versions of FLUX.2 for commercial deployments, while also publishing inspectable open-weight models that researchers and independent developers can run locally. This approach extends a track record begun with FLUX.1, which became the most widely used open image model globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Model Variants and Deployment Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flux.2 arrives with 5 variants as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Pro]:&lt;/b&gt; This is the highest-performance tier, intended for applications that require minimal latency and maximal visual fidelity. It is available through the BFL Playground, the FLUX API, and partner platforms. The model aims to match leading closed-weight systems in prompt adherence and image quality while reducing compute demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Flex]:&lt;/b&gt; This version exposes parameters such as the number of sampling steps and the guidance scale. The design enables developers to tune the trade-offs between speed, text accuracy, and detail fidelity. In practice, this enables workflows where low-step previews can be generated quickly before higher-step renders are invoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Dev]:&lt;/b&gt; The most notable release for the open ecosystem is the 32-billion-parameter open-weight checkpoint which integrates text-to-image generation and image editing into a single model. It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 [Klein]:&lt;/b&gt; Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flux.2 – VAE:&lt;/b&gt; Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license,  updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benchmark Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana Pro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bfl.ai/pricing"&gt;pricing calculator on BFL’s site&lt;/a&gt; indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka &amp;quot;Nano Banana Pro,&amp;quot; currently &lt;a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing"&gt;prices image output &lt;/a&gt;at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Design and the Latent Space Overhaul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capabilities Across Creative Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem and Open-Core Strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest Labs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs (BFL) was &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;founded in 2024 &lt;/a&gt;by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFL’s first major release, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;FLUX.1&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/black-forest-labs-releases-flux-1-1-pro-and-an-api"&gt;BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision Makers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not just &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-gemini-3-claiming-the-lead-in-math-science-multimodal-and"&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s Gemini 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-upgraded-nano-banana-pro-ai-image-model-hailed-as-absolutely-bonkers"&gt;Nano Banana Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-opus-4-5-is-here-cheaper-ai-infinite-chats-and-coding"&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt; we have to be thankful for this year around the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, today the German AI startup &lt;a href="https://bfl.ai/blog/flux-2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Forest Labs released FLUX.2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new image generation and editing system complete with four different models designed to support production-grade creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 introduces multi-reference conditioning, higher-fidelity outputs, and improved text rendering, and it expands the company’s open-core ecosystem with both commercial endpoints and open-weight checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Black Forest Labs previously launched with and made a name for itself on open source text-to-image models in its Flux family, today&amp;#x27;s release includes one fully open-source component: the Flux.2 VAE, available now under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four other models of varying size and uses — Flux.2 [Pro], Flux.2 [Flex], and Flux.2 [Dev] —are not open source; Pro and Flex remain proprietary hosted offerings, while Dev is an open-weight downloadable model that requires a commercial license obtained directly from Black Forest Labs for any commercial use.

These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost.

Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical Design and the Latent Space Overhaul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Capabilities Across Creative Workflows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem and Open-Core Strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest Labs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Forest Labs (BFL) was &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;founded in 2024 &lt;/a&gt;by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BFL’s first major release, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stable-diffusion-creators-launch-black-forest-labs-secure-31m-for-flux-1-ai-image-generator"&gt;FLUX.1&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/black-forest-labs-releases-flux-1-1-pro-and-an-api"&gt;BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision Makers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/black-forest-labs-launches-flux-2-ai-image-models-to-challenge-nano-banana</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 03:46:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Researchers discover a shortcoming that makes LLMs less reliable (MIT News - Artificial intelligence)</title><link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/shortcoming-makes-llms-less-reliable-1126</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202511/LLM-Lessons-01a-press.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="news-article--content--body--inner"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) sometimes learn the wrong lessons, according to an MIT study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than answering a query based on domain knowledge, an LLM could respond by leveraging grammatical patterns it learned during training. This can cause a model to fail unexpectedly when deployed on new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that models can mistakenly link certain sentence patterns to specific topics, so an LLM might give a convincing answer by recognizing familiar phrasing instead of understanding the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments showed that even the most powerful LLMs can make this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shortcoming could reduce the reliability of LLMs that perform tasks like handling customer inquiries, summarizing clinical notes, and generating financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also have safety risks. A nefarious actor could exploit this to trick LLMs into producing harmful content, even when the models have safeguards to prevent such responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying this phenomenon and exploring its implications, the researchers developed a benchmarking procedure to evaluate a model’s reliance on these incorrect correlations. The procedure could help developers mitigate the problem before deploying LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a byproduct of how we train models, but models are now used in practice in safety-critical domains far beyond the tasks that created these syntactic failure modes. If you’re not familiar with model training as an end-user, this is likely to be unexpected,” says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an associate professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the MIT Institute of Medical Engineering Sciences and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghassemi is joined by co-lead authors Chantal Shaib, a graduate student at Northeastern University and visiting student at MIT; and Vinith Suriyakumar, an MIT graduate student; as well as Levent Sagun, a research scientist at Meta; and Byron Wallace, the Sy and Laurie Sternberg Interdisciplinary Associate Professor and associate dean of research at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences. A paper describing the work will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuck on syntax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs are trained on a massive amount of text from the internet. During this training process, the model learns to understand the relationships between words and phrases — knowledge it uses later when responding to queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prior work, the researchers found that LLMs pick up patterns in the parts of speech that frequently appear together in training data. They call these part-of-speech patterns “syntactic templates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs need this understanding of syntax, along with semantic knowledge, to answer questions in a particular domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the news domain, for instance, there is a particular style of writing. So, not only is the model learning the semantics, it is also learning the underlying structure of how sentences should be put together to follow a specific style for that domain,” Shaib explains.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this research, they determined that LLMs learn to associate these syntactic templates with specific domains. The model may incorrectly rely solely on this learned association when answering questions, rather than on an understanding of the query and subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, an LLM might learn that a question like “Where is Paris located?” is structured as adverb/verb/proper noun/verb. If there are many examples of sentence construction in the model’s training data, the LLM may associate that syntactic template with questions about countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if the model is given a new question with the same grammatical structure but nonsense words, like “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” it might answer “France” even though that answer makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an overlooked type of association that the model learns in order to answer questions correctly. We should be paying closer attention to not only the semantics but the syntax of the data we use to train our models,” Shaib says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing the meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested this phenomenon by designing synthetic experiments in which only one syntactic template appeared in the model’s training data for each domain. They tested the models by substituting words with synonyms, antonyms, or random words, but kept the underlying syntax the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each instance, they found that LLMs often still responded with the correct answer, even when the question was complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they restructured the same question using a new part-of-speech pattern, the LLMs often failed to give the correct response, even though the underlying meaning of the question remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used this approach to test pre-trained LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama, and found that this same learned behavior significantly lowered their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about the broader implications of these findings, the researchers studied whether someone could exploit this phenomenon to elicit harmful responses from an LLM that has been deliberately trained to refuse such requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that, by phrasing the question using a syntactic template the model associates with a “safe” dataset (one that doesn’t contain harmful information), they could trick the model into overriding its refusal policy and generating harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this work, it is clear to me that we need more robust defenses to address security vulnerabilities in LLMs. In this paper, we identified a new vulnerability that arises due to the way LLMs learn. So, we need to figure out new defenses based on how LLMs learn language, rather than just ad hoc solutions to different vulnerabilities,” Suriyakumar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn’t explore mitigation strategies in this work, they developed an automatic benchmarking technique one could use to evaluate an LLM’s reliance on this incorrect syntax-domain correlation. This new test could help developers proactively address this shortcoming in their models, reducing safety risks and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to study potential mitigation strategies, which could involve augmenting training data to provide a wider variety of syntactic templates. They are also interested in exploring this phenomenon in reasoning models, special types of LLMs designed to tackle multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this is a really creative angle to study failure modes of LLMs. This work highlights the importance of linguistic knowledge and analysis in LLM safety research, an aspect that hasn’t been at the center stage but clearly should be,” says Jessy Li, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by a Bridgewater AIA Labs Fellowship, the National Science Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, a Google Research Award, and Schmidt Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

The country now has broader access to cloud and AI tools after Microsoft expanded the services available in the Indonesia Central cloud region, which first went live six months ago. The expansion gives businesses, public bodies, and developers more options to run AI workloads inside the country instead of overseas data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update was shared at the Cloud &amp;amp; AI Innovation Summit in Jakarta, where business and government leaders met to discuss how Indonesia can advance its AI ambitions. Speakers included Mike Chan, who leads Azure AI Apps &amp;amp; Agents in Asia, and Dharma Simorangkir, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia. Their message was that local capacity is only useful if organisations put it to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the event, Dharma said the new services “open the door for every organisation to innovate in Indonesia, for Indonesia,” calling on teams in sectors to build solutions that tackle national needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A shift toward building, not just adopting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesian enterprises are moving beyond basic AI trials and are now designing tools that solve problems unique to their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft describes these kinds of organisations as Frontier Firms – teams that treat AI as a core part of how they work rather than an optional add-on. The firms tend to focus on building applications that make tasks easier for customers, improve internal processes, or modernise old workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this shift, the Indonesia Central region now hosts a range of Azure services that help teams design and deploy software. They include tools for building data-connected applications, services for storing and managing structured data, and a set of AI-ready virtual machines that can train and run advanced models. Machines built for heavy computing work allow teams to keep data inside the country while working with complex AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region now supports Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing AI features to common work tools. Developers also have access to GitHub Copilot, which suggests code and speeds up software development. These services form a connected stack that helps teams move past small pilots and into production, where reliability and cost control matter more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early Microsoft cloud projects emerging in Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the region follows steady demand since its launch in May 2025. Companies in mining, travel, and digital services are already using local cloud infrastructure to refresh legacy systems and meet stricter data governance needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrosea and Vale Indonesia are among the firms using the region to support technical upgrades and secure local data storage. Digital-first players are also experimenting with more direct AI engagement. One example is tiket.com, which built its own AI travel assistant using the Azure OpenAI Service. The assistant lets customers interact with the platform in everyday language, from checking flight updates to adding extra services after a booking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our advancements in artificial intelligence are designed to deliver the best possible experience for our customers,” said Irvan Bastian Arief, PhD, Vice President of Technology GRAND, Data &amp;amp; AI at tiket.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company sees conversational AI as a way to make travel planning simpler while reducing friction in customer support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bringing scattered data into one system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major theme at the summit was the need to get data in order before adopting AI at scale. To support this, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Fabric to the Indonesian market. Fabric is a single environment that brings together data engineering, integration, warehousing, analytics, and business intelligence. It includes Copilot features that help teams prepare data and build insights without juggling multiple tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many organisations, data sits in different internal systems and cloud providers. Fabric gives teams one place to bring these sources together, which may help improve governance, speed up reporting, and control costs. The platform is designed for teams that want structure without building their own data foundation from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing Indonesia’s workforce for practical AI with Microsoft tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day’s focus was not limited to infrastructure. Microsoft also highlighted its AI training program, Microsoft Elevate, which is now entering its second year. The programme has already reached more than 1.2 million learners and aims to certify 500,000 people in AI skills by 2026. The next phase will focus on hands-on use, encouraging participants to apply AI in real settings rather than only learning concepts in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training covers a wide range of groups – teachers, nonprofit workers, community leaders, and people looking to improve their digital skills. Participants learn through tools like Microsoft Copilot, Learning Accelerator, Minecraft Education, and modules designed to explain how AI can support practical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summit, Dharma said that cloud and AI “are the backbone of national competitiveness” and stressed that infrastructure only matters if people are prepared to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a long-term ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efforts sit in a broader commitment of US$1.7 billion that Microsoft has pledged for Indonesia from 2024 to 2028. The investment spans infrastructure, partner support, and talent development.

The country now has broader access to cloud and AI tools after Microsoft expanded the services available in the Indonesia Central cloud region, which first went live six months ago. The expansion gives businesses, public bodies, and developers more options to run AI workloads inside the country instead of overseas data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update was shared at the Cloud &amp;amp; AI Innovation Summit in Jakarta, where business and government leaders met to discuss how Indonesia can advance its AI ambitions. Speakers included Mike Chan, who leads Azure AI Apps &amp;amp; Agents in Asia, and Dharma Simorangkir, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia. Their message was that local capacity is only useful if organisations put it to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the event, Dharma said the new services “open the door for every organisation to innovate in Indonesia, for Indonesia,” calling on teams in sectors to build solutions that tackle national needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A shift toward building, not just adopting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesian enterprises are moving beyond basic AI trials and are now designing tools that solve problems unique to their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft describes these kinds of organisations as Frontier Firms – teams that treat AI as a core part of how they work rather than an optional add-on. The firms tend to focus on building applications that make tasks easier for customers, improve internal processes, or modernise old workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this shift, the Indonesia Central region now hosts a range of Azure services that help teams design and deploy software. They include tools for building data-connected applications, services for storing and managing structured data, and a set of AI-ready virtual machines that can train and run advanced models. Machines built for heavy computing work allow teams to keep data inside the country while working with complex AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region now supports Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing AI features to common work tools. Developers also have access to GitHub Copilot, which suggests code and speeds up software development. These services form a connected stack that helps teams move past small pilots and into production, where reliability and cost control matter more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early Microsoft cloud projects emerging in Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the region follows steady demand since its launch in May 2025. Companies in mining, travel, and digital services are already using local cloud infrastructure to refresh legacy systems and meet stricter data governance needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrosea and Vale Indonesia are among the firms using the region to support technical upgrades and secure local data storage. Digital-first players are also experimenting with more direct AI engagement. One example is tiket.com, which built its own AI travel assistant using the Azure OpenAI Service. The assistant lets customers interact with the platform in everyday language, from checking flight updates to adding extra services after a booking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our advancements in artificial intelligence are designed to deliver the best possible experience for our customers,” said Irvan Bastian Arief, PhD, Vice President of Technology GRAND, Data &amp;amp; AI at tiket.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company sees conversational AI as a way to make travel planning simpler while reducing friction in customer support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bringing scattered data into one system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major theme at the summit was the need to get data in order before adopting AI at scale. To support this, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Fabric to the Indonesian market. Fabric is a single environment that brings together data engineering, integration, warehousing, analytics, and business intelligence. It includes Copilot features that help teams prepare data and build insights without juggling multiple tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many organisations, data sits in different internal systems and cloud providers. Fabric gives teams one place to bring these sources together, which may help improve governance, speed up reporting, and control costs. The platform is designed for teams that want structure without building their own data foundation from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing Indonesia’s workforce for practical AI with Microsoft tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day’s focus was not limited to infrastructure. Microsoft also highlighted its AI training program, Microsoft Elevate, which is now entering its second year. The programme has already reached more than 1.2 million learners and aims to certify 500,000 people in AI skills by 2026. The next phase will focus on hands-on use, encouraging participants to apply AI in real settings rather than only learning concepts in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training covers a wide range of groups – teachers, nonprofit workers, community leaders, and people looking to improve their digital skills. Participants learn through tools like Microsoft Copilot, Learning Accelerator, Minecraft Education, and modules designed to explain how AI can support practical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summit, Dharma said that cloud and AI “are the backbone of national competitiveness” and stressed that infrastructure only matters if people are prepared to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a long-term ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efforts sit in a broader commitment of US$1.7 billion that Microsoft has pledged for Indonesia from 2024 to 2028. The investment spans infrastructure, partner support, and talent development. The company is also preparing to host GitHub Universe Jakarta on 3 December 2025, a developer-focused gathering meant to encourage collaboration among software teams, startups, and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is aiming to position itself as a centre for secure and inclusive AI development in the region.

OpenAI, Google, and Amazon have heavily invested in AI assistants that research new product categories for you and suggest the right ones to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Startups like Perplexity, Daydream, and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton (previously known as Deft), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup’s total funding to approximately $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070599" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copia-de-Onton-founders-Zach-Hudson-and-Alex-Gunnarson.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Onton co-founders Zach Hudson and Alex Gunnarson Image Credits: Onton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zack Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070601" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-search-with-onton.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Onton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For its core technology, the company uses what’s called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup’s model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Let’s say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly. Our tools know that if the item has polyester in it, it would be more stain and scratch-resistant, so it would be more pet-friendly. Our tools learn these things through every single search and become smarter at a faster rate,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He added that often, when you search for a product that might be called different things on different sites, you don’t get great results. The company’s AI model takes those scenarios into consideration while presenting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Onton has added different input methods and features to help people with their short and long-term decisions. You can now upload an image or add a prompt to generate what you want to achieve with your house or office setup, and Onton can find you furniture based on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3070602" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/search-and-editing-images-in-ontons-new-AI-canvas.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Onton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Onton also offers an infinite canvas with image generation, where you can add existing images along with the products you find for ideation. You can also add images of your room and ask the tool to furnish it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company feels that rather than stick to a chat-only approach, these features will give consumers more options to get to what they want, even if they don’t know how to describe it perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup said that with these approaches, it has been able to convert customers 3-5x more than traditional e-commerce sites, as they can trust the underlying data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hudson noted that because of the technological and interface changes it made, it will be easier to launch apparel. The company is building its catalog for the category and plans to launch the vertical soon. In this category, it will face competition from companies like Daydream, Aesthetic, and Style.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
