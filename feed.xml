Those who can produce it, especially lots of it, get to exert authority in all sorts of ways. It brings revenue and enables manufacturing, data processing, transportation, and military might. Energy resources are arguably a nation’s most important asset. Look at Russia, or Saudi Arabia, or China, or Canada, or Qatar, or—for that matter—the US. For all these nations, energy production plays key roles in their economies and their outsize global status. (Qatar, for example, has a population roughly the size of metro Portland, Oregon.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1035426" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mat_final.png?w=1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US has always been a nation of energy and industry. It was a major producer of coal, which fed the Industrial Revolution. World War II was won in large part by the energy production in the United States—which fueled both manufacturing of the war machine at home and its ships, planes, and tanks in the Pacific and Europe. Throughout its history, the country has found strength in energy production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in many ways right now the US seems to be forgetting those lessons. It is moving backward in terms of its clean-­energy strategy, especially when it comes to powering the grid, in ways that will affect the nation for decades to come—even as China and others are surging forward. And that retreat is taking place just as electricity demand and usage are growing again after being flat for nearly two decades. That growth, according to the US Energy Information Administration, is “coming from the commercial sector, which includes data centers, and the industrial sector, which includes manufacturing establishments.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has extensively reported, energy demand from data centers is set to soar, not plateau, as AI inhales ever more electricity from the grid. As my colleagues James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart reported, by 2028 the share of US electricity going to power data centers may &lt;em&gt;triple&lt;/em&gt;. (For the full report, see technologyreview.com/energy-ai.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Both manufacturing and data centers are obviously priorities for the US writ large and the Trump administration in particular. Given those priorities, it’s surprising to see the administration and Congress making moves that would both decrease our potential energy supply and increase demand by lowering efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This will be most true for electricity generation. The administration’s proposed budget, still being considered as we went to press, would roll back tax credits for wind, solar, and other forms of clean energy. In households, they would hit credits for rooftop solar panels and residential energy efficiency programs. Simultaneously, the US is trying to roll back efficiency standards for household appliances. These standards are key to keeping consumer electricity prices down by decreasing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In short, what most analysts are expecting is more strain on the grid, which means prices will go up for everyone. Meanwhile, rollbacks to the Inflation Reduction Act and to credits for advanced manufacturing mean that fewer future-facing energy sources will be built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is just belligerently shortsighted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s especially true because as the US takes steps to make energy less abundant and more expensive, China—our ostensible chief international antagonist—is moving in exactly the opposite direction. The country has made massive strides in renewable energy generation, hitting its goals six years ahead of schedule. In fact, China is now producing so much clean energy that its carbon dioxide emissions are declining as a result.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This issue is about power, in all its forms. Yet whether you’re talking about the ability to act or the act of providing electricity, power comes from energy. So when it comes to energy, we need “ands,” not “ors.” We need nuclear and solar and wind and hydropower and hydrogen and geothermal and batteries on the grid. And we need efficiency. And yes, we even need oil and gas in the mid term while we ramp up cleaner sources. That is the way to maintain and increase our prosperity, and the only way we can possibly head off some of the worst consequences of climate change.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may sound bluntly obvious, but energy is power.

Originally conceived as an homage to &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;’s iconic fashion, Every Outfit has since evolved into a wider cultural critique and spawned a podcast of the same name that I love listening to while running. &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; may be over, but Every Outfit is forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glorious Exploits,&lt;/em&gt; by Ferdia Lennon&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glorious Exploits&lt;/em&gt; is one of those rare books that manage to pull off being both laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moving, which is no mean feat. Set in ancient Sicily, it tells the story of unemployed potters Lampo and Gelon’s grand plan to stage the Greek tragedy &lt;em&gt;Medea&lt;/em&gt; with a cast of defeated Athenian soldiers who’ve been imprisoned in quarries on the outskirts of Syracuse. The ancient backdrop combined with the characters’ contemporary Irish dialogue (the author was born in Dublin) makes it unlike anything I’ve ever read before; it’s so ambitious it’s hard to believe it’s Lennon’s debut novel. Completely engrossing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Life drawing&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The depressing wave of AI-generated art that’s flooded the internet in recent years has inspired me to explore the exact opposite and make art the old-fashioned way. My art teacher in college always said the best way to learn the correct proportions of the human body was to draw it in person, so I’ve started attending classes near where I live in London. Pencil and paper are generally my medium of choice. Spending a few hours interpreting what’s in front of you in your own artistic style is really rewarding—and has the added bonus of being completely screen-free.

The ancient backdrop combined with the characters’ contemporary Irish dialogue (the author was born in Dublin) makes it unlike anything I’ve ever read before; it’s so ambitious it’s hard to believe it’s Lennon’s debut novel. Completely engrossing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Life drawing&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The depressing wave of AI-generated art that’s flooded the internet in recent years has inspired me to explore the exact opposite and make art the old-fashioned way. My art teacher in college always said the best way to learn the correct proportions of the human body was to draw it in person, so I’ve started attending classes near where I live in London. Pencil and paper are generally my medium of choice. Spending a few hours interpreting what’s in front of you in your own artistic style is really rewarding—and has the added bonus of being completely screen-free. I can’t recommend it enough.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/25/1118448/rhiannon-williams-instagram-life-drawing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The AI Hype Index: AI-powered toys are coming (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/25/1119286/ai-hype-index-toys-agents-openai-yoshua-bengio/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250624_JuneThumb.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn’t always easy.

But amid all the talk about innovation and global competitiveness, one issue has been glaringly absent: financial privacy. As we build the digital infrastructure of the 21st century, we need to talk about not just what’s possible but what’s acceptable. That means confronting the expanding surveillance powers quietly embedded in our financial system, which today can track nearly every transaction without a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Americans may associate financial surveillance with authoritarian regimes. Yet because of a Nixon-era law called the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and the digitization of finance over the past half-century, financial privacy is under increasingly serious threat here at home. Most Americans don’t realize they live under an expansive surveillance regime that likely violates their constitutional rights. Every purchase, deposit, and transaction, from the smallest Venmo payment for a coffee to a large hospital bill, creates a data point in a system that watches you—even if you’ve done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former federal prosecutor, I care deeply about giving law enforcement the tools it needs to keep us safe. But the status quo doesn’t make us safer. It creates a false sense of security while quietly and permanently eroding the constitutional rights of millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Congress enacted the BSA in 1970, cash was king and organized crime was the target. The law created a scheme whereby, ever since, banks have been required to keep certain records on their customers and turn them over to law enforcement upon request. Unlike a search warrant, which must be issued by a judge or magistrate upon a showing of probable cause that a crime was committed and that specific evidence of that crime exists in the place to be searched, this power is exercised with no checks or balances. A prosecutor can “cut a subpoena”—demanding all your bank records for the past 10 years—with no judicial oversight or limitation on scope, and at no cost to the government. The burden falls entirely on the bank. In contrast, a proper search warrant must be narrowly tailored, with probable cause and judicial authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;United States v. Miller&lt;/em&gt; (1976), the Supreme Court upheld the BSA, reasoning that citizens have no “legitimate expectation of privacy” about information shared with third parties, like banks. Thus began the third-party doctrine, enabling law enforcement to access financial records without a warrant. The BSA has been amended several times over the years (most notoriously in 2001 as a part of the Patriot Act), imposing an ever-growing list of recordkeeping obligations on an ever-growing list of financial institutions. Today, it is virtually inescapable for everyday Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, when the BSA was enacted, banking and noncash payments were conducted predominantly through physical means: writing checks, visiting bank branches, and using passbooks. For cash transactions, the BSA required reporting of transactions over the kingly sum of $10,000, a figure that was not pegged to inflation and remains the same today. And given the nature of banking services and the technology available at the time, individuals conducted just a handful of noncash payments per month. Today, consumers make at least one payment or banking transaction a day, and just an estimated 16% of those are in cash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, emerging technologies further expand the footprint of financial data. Add to this the massive pools of personal information already collected by technology platforms—location history, search activity, communications metadata—and you create a world where financial surveillance can be linked to virtually every aspect of your identity, movement, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor does the BSA actually appear to be effective at achieving its aims. In fiscal year 2024, financial institutions filed about 4.7 million Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and over 20 million currency transaction reports. Instead of stopping major crime, the system floods law enforcement with low-value information, overwhelming agents and obscuring real threats. Mass surveillance often reduces effectiveness by drowning law enforcement in noise. But while it doesn’t stop hackers, the BSA creates a trove of permanent info on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse still, the incentives are misaligned and asymmetrical. To avoid liability, financial institutions are required to report anything remotely suspicious. If they fail to file a SAR, they risk serious penalties—even indictment. But they face no consequences for overreporting. The vast overcollection of data is the unsurprising result. These practices, developed under regulations, require clearer guardrails so that executive branch actors can more safely outsource surveillance duties to private institutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But courts have recognized that constitutional privacy must evolve alongside technology. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in &lt;em&gt;United States v. Jones&lt;/em&gt; that attaching a GPS tracker to a vehicle for prolonged surveillance constituted a search restricted by the Fourth Amendment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a notable concurrence, argued that the third-party doctrine was ill suited to an era when individuals "reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties" merely by participating in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This legal evolution continued in 2018, when the Supreme Court held in &lt;em&gt;Carpenter v. United States &lt;/em&gt;that accessing historical cell-phone location records held by a third party required a warrant, recognizing that “seismic shifts in digital technology” necessitate stronger protections and warning that “the fact that such information is gathered by a third party does not make it any less deserving of Fourth Amendment protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logic of &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; applies directly to the mass of financial records being collected today. Just as tracking a person’s phone over time reveals the “whole of their physical movements,” tracking a person’s financial life exposes travel, daily patterns, medical treatments, political affiliations, and personal associations. In many ways, because of the velocity and digital nature of today’s digital payments, financial data is among the most personal and revealing data there is—and therefore deserves the highest level of constitutional protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt; remains formally intact, the writing is on the wall: Indiscriminate financial surveillance such as what we have today is fundamentally at odds with the Fourth Amendment in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological innovations over the past several decades have brought incredible convenience to economic life. Now our privacy standards must catch up. With Congress considering landmark legislation on digital assets, it’s an important moment to consider what kind of financial system we want—not just in terms of efficiency and access, but in terms of freedom. Rather than striking down the BSA in its entirety, policymakers should narrow its reach, particularly around the bulk collection and warrantless sharing of Americans’ financial data.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Financial surveillance shouldn’t be the price of participation in modern life. The systems we build now will shape what freedom looks like for the next century. It’s time to treat financial privacy like what it is: a cornerstone of democracy, and a right worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katie Haun is the CEO and founder of Haun Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on frontier technologies.
