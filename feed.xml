I cleaned out my cart and considered myself lucky that it didn‚Äôt buy anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I logged onto Facebook, which is already lousy with all sorts of AI slop, I asked it to create a status update for me. So it dug through my browser history and came back with an incredibly long status I won‚Äôt bore you with all of it (and there was a lot) but here are the highlights from what it suggested:&amp;nbsp; ‚ÄúI dipped into Smartsheet and TeamSnap (because editors juggle rosters too!), flirted with Shopify and Amazon (holiday gift‚Äëshopping? side hustle? you decide), and kept tabs on the news ‚Ä¶ .

 &lt;p&gt;Uh. Okay. I decided against posting that. There were some other equally unillustrious examples as well, but you get the picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aside from the agent, the other unique feature is having ChatGPT built right into the browser.

In some cases, the built-in chatbot was worse and dumber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, I asked the built-in ChatGPT to summarize a &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;article I was reading for me. Yet instead of answering the question about the page I was on, it referred back to the page I had previously been on when I started the session. Which is to say it spit back some useless nonsense. Thanks, AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is marketing Atlas pretty aggressively when you come to ChatGPT now, suggesting people download it. And it may in fact score a lot of downloads because of that. But without giving people more of a reason to actually switch from more entrenched browsers, like Chrome or Safari, this feels like a real empty salvo in the new browser wars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been hard for me to understand why Atlas exists. Who is this browser for, exactly? Who is its customer? And the answer I have come to there is that Atlas is for OpenAI.

          &lt;p&gt;Businesses are increasingly being deceived by employees using artificial intelligence for an age-old scam: faking expense receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of new image-generation models by top AI groups such as OpenAI and Google in recent months has sparked an influx of AI-generated receipts submitted internally within companies, according to leading expense software platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software provider AppZen said fake AI receipts accounted for about 14 percent of fraudulent documents submitted in September, compared with none last year. Fintech group Ramp said its new software flagged more than $1 million in fraudulent invoices within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of US and UK financial professionals surveyed by expense management platform Medius reported they had seen a rise in falsified receipts following the launch of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThese receipts have become so good, we tell our customers, ‚Äòdo not trust your eyes,‚Äô‚Äù said Chris Juneau, senior vice-president and head of product marketing for SAP Concur, one of the world‚Äôs leading expense platforms, which processes more than 80 million compliance checks monthly using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several platforms attributed a significant jump in the number of AI-generated receipts after OpenAI launched GPT-4o‚Äôs improved image generation model in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI told the Financial Times that it takes action when its policies are violated and its images contained metadata that signaled they were created by ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating fraudulent documents previously required skills in photo editing or paying for such services through online vendors. The advent of free and accessible image generation software has made it easy for employees to quickly falsify receipts in seconds by writing simple text instructions to chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several receipts shown to the FT by expense management platforms demonstrated the realistic nature of the images, which included wrinkles in paper, detailed itemization that matched real-life menus, and signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a future threat; it‚Äôs already happening. While currently only a small percentage of non-compliant receipts are AI-generated, this is only going to grow,‚Äù said Sebastien Marchon, chief executive of Rydoo, an expense management platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in these more realistic copies has led companies to turn to AI to help detect fake receipts, as most are too convincing to be found by human reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software works by scanning receipts to check the metadata of the image to discover whether an AI platform created it. However, this can be easily removed by users taking a photo or a screenshot of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this, it also considers other contextual information by examining details such as repetition in server names and times and broader information about the employee‚Äôs trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe tech can look at everything with high details of focus and attention that humans, after a period of time, things fall through the cracks, they are human,‚Äù added Calvin Lee, senior director of product management at Ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by SAP in July found that nearly 70 percent of chief financial officers believed their employees were using AI to attempt to falsify travel expenses or receipts, with about 10 percent adding they are certain it has happened in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason Wilder, research director at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, said AI-generated fraudulent receipts were a ‚Äúsignificant issue for organizations.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: ‚ÄúThere is zero barrier for entry for people to do this. You don‚Äôt need any kind of technological skills or aptitude like you maybe would have needed five years ago using Photoshop.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several receipts shown to the FT by expense management platforms demonstrated the realistic nature of the images, which included wrinkles in paper, detailed itemization that matched real-life menus, and signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a future threat; it‚Äôs already happening. While currently only a small percentage of non-compliant receipts are AI-generated, this is only going to grow,‚Äù said Sebastien Marchon, chief executive of Rydoo, an expense management platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in these more realistic copies has led companies to turn to AI to help detect fake receipts, as most are too convincing to be found by human reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software works by scanning receipts to check the metadata of the image to discover whether an AI platform created it. However, this can be easily removed by users taking a photo or a screenshot of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this, it also considers other contextual information by examining details such as repetition in server names and times and broader information about the employee‚Äôs trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe tech can look at everything with high details of focus and attention that humans, after a period of time, things fall through the cracks, they are human,‚Äù added Calvin Lee, senior director of product management at Ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by SAP in July found that nearly 70 percent of chief financial officers believed their employees were using AI to attempt to falsify travel expenses or receipts, with about 10 percent adding they are certain it has happened in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason Wilder, research director at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, said AI-generated fraudulent receipts were a ‚Äúsignificant issue for organizations.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: ‚ÄúThere is zero barrier for entry for people to do this. You don‚Äôt need any kind of technological skills or aptitude like you maybe would have needed five years ago using Photoshop.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

These features include an AI-driven collage, ‚ÄúStyled for you,‚Äù that helps users create outfits from saved fashion Pins, and ‚ÄúBoards made for you,‚Äù which are personalized boards curated with AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúStyled for you‚Äù collages allow users to combine different clothing and accessories to create new outfits tailored to their individual style preferences. By tapping an item in the collage, users can swipe through AI-recommended saved pins for mixing and matching.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Pinterest is also testing ‚ÄúBoards made for you,‚Äù personalized boards curated from a blend of editorial input and AI-powered suggestions. These boards ‚Äîfeaturing trending styles, weekly outfit inspiration, and shoppable content ‚Äî will be featured in users‚Äô home feeds and in their inboxes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is initially experimenting with the AI features in the U.S. and Canada. They‚Äôll start rolling out in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062515" height="452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pinterest_Boardsforyou.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the aim of these AI features is to evolve Pinterest boards from mere organizational tools into a more personalized way to explore, shop, and find outfit inspiration. This initiative aligns with Pinterest‚Äôs goal to position itself as an ‚ÄúAI-enabled shopping assistant,‚Äù as indicated by the CEO during the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call. Pinterest has already integrated AI in various ways, including AI-driven recommendations and visual search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, while the platform is introducing more AI features on the one hand, it‚Äôs also trying to keep AI-generated content off its platform on the other. In April, the company announced its plan to label AI-generated and AI-modified images. It also introduced controls that let users reduce the number of AI-generated Pins they see in their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the new AI experiments, there will be new tabs that sort Pins into categories, accessible by viewing boards from user profiles. These updates are set to roll out globally in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the new tabs, called ‚ÄúMake It Yours,‚Äù will recommend fashion and home decor products based on a user‚Äôs saved Pins. The ‚ÄúMore Ideas‚Äù tab will suggest related Pins across categories such as beauty, recipes, and art. Lastly, an ‚ÄúAll Saves‚Äù tab will let users easily find all their previously saved Pins.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Pinterest announced on Monday new AI-powered upgrades to its boards to make them more personalized for users.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is initially experimenting with the AI features in the U.S. and Canada. They‚Äôll start rolling out in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062515" height="452" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pinterest_Boardsforyou.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says the aim of these AI features is to evolve Pinterest boards from mere organizational tools into a more personalized way to explore, shop, and find outfit inspiration. This initiative aligns with Pinterest‚Äôs goal to position itself as an ‚ÄúAI-enabled shopping assistant,‚Äù as indicated by the CEO during the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call. Pinterest has already integrated AI in various ways, including AI-driven recommendations and visual search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, while the platform is introducing more AI features on the one hand, it‚Äôs also trying to keep AI-generated content off its platform on the other. In April, the company announced its plan to label AI-generated and AI-modified images. It also introduced controls that let users reduce the number of AI-generated Pins they see in their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the new AI experiments, there will be new tabs that sort Pins into categories, accessible by viewing boards from user profiles. These updates are set to roll out globally in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the new tabs, called ‚ÄúMake It Yours,‚Äù will recommend fashion and home decor products based on a user‚Äôs saved Pins. The ‚ÄúMore Ideas‚Äù tab will suggest related Pins across categories such as beauty, recipes, and art. Lastly, an ‚ÄúAll Saves‚Äù tab will let users easily find all their previously saved Pins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/pinterest-experiments-with-new-ai-powered-personalized-boards/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:35:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Mercor quintuples valuation to $10B with $350M Series C (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/mercor-quintuples-valuation-to-10b-with-350m-series-c/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9747_3d5c52.jpeg?resize=1200,960" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mercor, which connects AI labs with domain experts for training their foundational AI models, has raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Felicis Ventures, which led the company‚Äôs previous $100 million Series B at a $2 billion valuation, is also leading this round. Existing investors Benchmark and General Catalyst, and new investor Robinhood Ventures also participated.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;TechCrunch reported in September that Mercor was in talks with investors to raise a Series C at a valuation of $10 billion, up from its target of $8 billion a few months prior. The company at the time told potential investors that it already had multiple offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor started off as an AI-driven hiring platform, but quickly pivoted to providing companies with specialized domain experts to perform AI model training ‚Äî such as scientists, doctors, and lawyers ‚Äî and charging an hourly finder‚Äôs fee and matching rate for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has also been adding more software infrastructure for reinforcement learning ‚Äî a training method where a model‚Äôs or agent‚Äôs decisions are verified or disputed, enabling it to incorporate feedback and improve over time. The company intends to eventually build an AI-powered recruiting marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor‚Äôs fortunes rose after leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with data-labeling startup Scale AI after Meta invested $14 billion in the data vendor and hired its CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company apparently told investors that it‚Äôs on track to hit $500 million in ARR faster than Anysphere, the startup behind Cursor, which famously hit the milestone roughly a year after launching its core product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúSince we founded Mercor almost three years ago, AI has advanced at an astonishing pace. But it still struggles with the subtleties that drive economically valuable work‚Äîbalancing trade-offs, understanding intent, developing taste, and deciding what should be done, not just what can be done,‚Äù the company wrote in a blog post emailed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup says it currently pays more than $1.5 million per day to its contractors. It has more than 30,000 experts on its roster, who it pays over $85 per hour on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Mercor said it will focus on three areas: expanding its talent network, improving its systems for matching its contractors with clients, and building new products to automate more of its processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9747_3d5c52.jpeg?resize=1200,960" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Mercor, which connects AI labs with domain experts for training their foundational AI models, has raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

Excel remains the lingua franca of finance, the digital workspace where analysts spend countless hours constructing financial models, running valuations, and stress-testing assumptions. By embedding Claude into this environment, Anthropic is meeting financial professionals exactly where they work rather than asking them to toggle between applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude for Excel allows users to work with the AI in a sidebar where it can read, analyze, modify, and create new Excel workbooks while providing full transparency about the actions it takes by tracking and explaining changes and letting users navigate directly to referenced cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency feature addresses one of the most persistent anxieties around AI in finance: &lt;a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When billions of dollars ride on a financial model&amp;#x27;s output, analysts need to understand not just the answer but how the AI arrived at it. By showing its work at the cell level, Anthropic is attempting to build the trust necessary for widespread adoption in an industry where careers and fortunes can turn on a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical implementation is sophisticated. Claude can discuss how spreadsheets work, modify them while preserving formula dependencies ‚Äî a notoriously complex task ‚Äî debug cell formulas, populate templates with new data, or build entirely new spreadsheets from scratch. This isn&amp;#x27;t merely a chatbot that answers questions about your data; it&amp;#x27;s a collaborative tool that can actively manipulate the models that drive investment decisions worth trillions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Anthropic is building data moats around its financial AI platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significant than the Excel integration is Anthropic&amp;#x27;s expansion of its connector ecosystem, which now links Claude to live market data and proprietary research from financial information giants. The company added six major new data partnerships spanning the entire spectrum of financial information that professional investors rely upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aiera.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aiera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now provides Claude with real-time earnings call transcripts and summaries of investor events like shareholder meetings, presentations, and conferences. The Aiera connector also enables a data feed from &lt;a href="https://www.thirdbridge.com/en-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Third Bridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gives Claude access to a library of insights interviews, company intelligence, and industry analysis from experts and former executives. &lt;a href="https://www.chronograph.pe/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronograph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives private equity investors operational and financial information for portfolio monitoring and conducting due diligence, including performance metrics, valuations, and fund-level data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.egnyte.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Egnyte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables Claude to securely search permitted data for internal data rooms, investment documents, and approved financial models while maintaining governed access controls. &lt;a href="https://www.lseg.com/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSEG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the London Stock Exchange Group, connects Claude to live market data including fixed income pricing, equities, foreign exchange rates, macroeconomic indicators, and analysts&amp;#x27; estimates of other important financial metrics. &lt;a href="https://www.moodys.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moody&amp;#x27;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides access to proprietary credit ratings, research, and company data covering ownership, financials, and news on more than 600 million public and private companies, supporting work and research in compliance, credit analysis, and business development. &lt;a href="https://www.mtnewswires.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MT Newswires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides Claude with access to the latest global multi-asset class news on financial markets and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These partnerships amount to a land grab for the informational infrastructure that powers modern finance. Previously announced in July, Anthropic had &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;already secured integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.capitaliq.com/CIQDotNet/Login-okta.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://daloopa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daloopa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.morningstar.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morningstar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factset.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FactSet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchbook.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PitchBook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these connectors give Claude access to virtually every category of financial data an analyst might need: fundamental company data, market prices, credit assessments, private company intelligence, alternative data, and breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because the quality of AI outputs depends entirely on the quality of inputs. Generic large language models trained on public internet data simply cannot compete with systems that have direct pipelines to Bloomberg-quality financial information. By securing these partnerships, Anthropic is building moats around its financial services offering that competitors will find difficult to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic calculus here is clear: Anthropic is betting that domain-specific AI systems with privileged access to proprietary data will outcompete general-purpose AI assistants. It&amp;#x27;s a direct challenge to the &amp;quot;one AI to rule them all&amp;quot; approach favored by some competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-configured workflows target the daily grind of Wall Street analysts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s announcement involves six new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; ‚Äî pre-configured workflows for common financial tasks. These skills are Anthropic&amp;#x27;s attempt to productize the workflows of entry-level and mid-level financial analysts, professionals who spend their days building models, processing due diligence documents, and writing research reports. Anthropic has designed skills specifically to automate these time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new skills include building discounted cash flow models complete with full free cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital calculations, scenario toggles, and sensitivity tables. There&amp;#x27;s comparable company analysis featuring valuation multiples and operating metrics that can be easily refreshed with updated data. Claude can now process data room documents into Excel spreadsheets populated with financial information, customer lists, and contract terms. It can create company teasers and profiles for pitch books and buyer lists, perform earnings analyses that use quarterly transcripts and financials to extract important metrics, guidance changes, and management commentary, and produce initiating coverage reports with industry analysis, company deep dives, and valuation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s worth noting that Anthropic&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonnet 4.5 model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now tops the &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/finance_agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finance Agent benchmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Vals AI at 55.3% accuracy, a metric designed to test AI systems on tasks expected of entry-level financial analysts. A 55% accuracy rate might sound underwhelming, but it is state-of-the-art performance and highlights both the promise and limitations of AI in finance. The technology can clearly handle sophisticated analytical tasks, but it&amp;#x27;s not yet reliable enough to operate autonomously without human oversight ‚Äî a reality that may actually reassure both regulators and the analysts whose jobs might otherwise be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approach is particularly clever because it packages AI capabilities in terms that financial institutions already understand. Rather than selling generic &amp;quot;AI assistance,&amp;quot; Anthropic is offering solutions to specific, well-defined problems: &amp;quot;You need a DCF model? We have a skill for that. You need to analyze earnings calls? We have a skill for that too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trillion-dollar clients are already seeing massive productivity gains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services strategy appears to be gaining traction with exactly the kind of marquee clients that matter in enterprise sales. The company counts among its clients &lt;a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIA Labs at Bridgewater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aig.com/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American International Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbim.no/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norges Bank Investment Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî Norway&amp;#x27;s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world&amp;#x27;s largest institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen reported achieving approximately 20% productivity gains, equivalent to 213,000 hours, with portfolio managers and risk departments now able to &amp;quot;seamlessly query our Snowflake data warehouse and analyze earnings calls with unprecedented efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At AIG, CEO Peter Zaffino said the partnership has &amp;quot;compressed the timeline to review business by more than 5x in our early rollouts while simultaneously improving our data accuracy from 75% to over 90%.&amp;quot; If these numbers hold across broader deployments, the productivity implications for the financial services industry are staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#x27;t pilot programs or proof-of-concept deployments; they&amp;#x27;re production implementations at institutions managing trillions of dollars in assets and making underwriting decisions that affect millions of customers. Their public endorsements provide the social proof that typically drives enterprise adoption in conservative industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulatory uncertainty creates both opportunity and risk for AI deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services ambitions unfold against a backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny and shifting enforcement priorities. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released guidance requiring lenders to &amp;quot;use specific and accurate reasons when taking adverse actions against consumers&amp;quot; involving AI, and issued additional guidance requiring regulated entities to &amp;quot;evaluate their underwriting models for bias&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;evaluate automated collateral-valuation and appraisal processes in ways that minimize bias.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brookings Institution analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these measures have since been revoked with work stopped or eliminated at the current downsized CFPB under the current administration, creating regulatory uncertainty. The pendulum has swung from the Biden administration&amp;#x27;s cautious approach, exemplified by an &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order on safe AI development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, toward the Trump administration&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;America&amp;#x27;s AI Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which seeks to &amp;quot;cement U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence&amp;quot; through deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regulatory flux creates both opportunities and risks. Financial institutions eager to deploy AI now face less prescriptive federal oversight, potentially accelerating adoption. But the absence of clear guardrails also exposes them to potential liability if AI systems produce discriminatory outcomes, particularly in lending and underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Attorney General recently reached a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-campbell-announces-25-million-settlement-with-student-loan-lender-for-unlawful-practices-through-ai-use-other-consumer-protection-violations"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$2.5 million settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with student loan company Earnest Operations, alleging that its use of AI models resulted in &amp;quot;disparate impact in approval rates and loan terms, specifically disadvantaging Black and Hispanic applicants.&amp;quot; Such cases will likely multiply as AI deployment grows, creating a patchwork of state-level enforcement even as federal oversight recedes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic appears acutely aware of these risks. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/anthropic-rolls-out-financial-ai-tools-target-large-clients-claude/753249/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Banking Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Pelosi, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s global head of industry for financial services, emphasized that Claude requires a &amp;quot;human in the loop.&amp;quot; The platform, he said, is not intended for autonomous financial decision-making or to provide stock recommendations that users follow blindly. During client onboarding, Pelosi told the publication, Anthropic focuses on training and understanding model limitations, putting guardrails in place so people treat Claude as a helpful technology rather than a replacement for human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition heats up as every major tech company targets finance AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services push comes as AI competition intensifies across the enterprise. &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?zx=1761550720312&amp;amp;no_sw_cr=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous startups are all vying for position in what may become one of AI&amp;#x27;s most lucrative verticals. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/goldman-sachs-launches-ai-assistant.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced a generative AI assistant to its bankers, traders, and asset managers in January, signaling that major banks may build their own capabilities rather than rely exclusively on third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of domain-specific AI models like &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BloombergGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî trained specifically on financial data ‚Äî suggests the market may fragment between generalized AI assistants and specialized tools. Anthropic&amp;#x27;s strategy appears to stake out a middle ground: general-purpose models, since Claude was not trained exclusively on financial data, enhanced with financial-specific tooling, data access, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s partnership strategy with implementation consultancies including &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPMG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/leadingedge.html?WT.mc_id=CT3-PL300-DM1-TR1-BR_XB_-OTHERFW_-Brand_Umbrella_Google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496735884&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABTtm-J1jFUwZ3oXf5hR5VenXYQfh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPzHBhDCARIsALlWNG0UNXvoWOQLTYylq3foXvjRNwHOD6SRzXaav5gXQG2APeHyRz5Us34aAn0lEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slalom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tribe.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TribeAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.turing.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is equally critical. These firms serve as force multipliers, embedding Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technology into their own service offerings and providing the change management expertise that financial institutions need to successfully adopt AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;CFOs worry about AI hallucinations and cascading errors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader question is whether AI tools like Claude will genuinely transform financial services productivity or merely shift work around. The PYMNTS Intelligence report &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study_posts/the-agentic-trust-gap-enterprise-cfos-push-pause-on-agentic-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Agentic Trust Gap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; found that chief financial officers remain hesitant about AI agents, with &amp;quot;nagging concern&amp;quot; about hallucinations where &amp;quot;an AI agent can go off script and expose firms to cascading payment errors and other inaccuracies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI&amp;#x27;s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call‚Äîor risk owning the fallout,&amp;quot; the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/boardleadership/pdf/2025/2025-survey-boardroom-lens-generative-ai.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 KPMG report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that 70% of board members have developed responsible use policies for employees, with other popular initiatives including implementing a recognized AI risk and governance framework, developing ethical guidelines and training programs for AI developers, and conducting regular AI use audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial services industry faces a delicate balancing act: move too slowly and risk competitive disadvantage as rivals achieve productivity gains; move too quickly and risk operational failures, regulatory penalties, or reputational damage. Speaking at the &lt;a href="https://evidentinsights.com/events/evident-ai-symposium-new-york-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evident AI Symposium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York last week, Ian Glasner, HSBC&amp;#x27;s group head of emerging technology, innovation and ventures, struck an optimistic tone about the sector&amp;#x27;s readiness for AI adoption. &amp;quot;As an industry, we are very well prepared to manage risk,&amp;quot; he said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/agentic-ai-governance-risk-mitigation-financial-services-banks/803667/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIO Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s not overcomplicate this. We just need to be focused on the business use case and the value associated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s latest moves suggest the company sees financial services as a beachhead market where AI&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clear, customers have deep pockets, and the technical requirements play to Claude&amp;#x27;s strengths in reasoning and accuracy. By building Excel integration, securing data partnerships, and pre-packaging common workflows, Anthropic is reducing the friction that typically slows enterprise AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt; $61.5 billion valuation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company commanded in its March fundraising round ‚Äî up from roughly $16 billion a year earlier ‚Äî suggests investors believe this strategy will work. But the real test will come as these tools move from pilot programs to production deployments across thousands of analysts and billions of dollars in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services may prove to be AI&amp;#x27;s most demanding proving ground: an industry where mistakes are costly, regulation is stringent, and trust is everything. If Claude can successfully navigate the spreadsheet cells and data feeds of Wall Street without hallucinating a decimal point in the wrong direction, Anthropic will have accomplished something far more valuable than winning another benchmark test. It will have proven that AI can be trusted with the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anthropic.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is making its most aggressive push yet into the trillion-dollar financial services industry, unveiling a suite of tools that embed its &lt;a href="http://claude.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; assistant directly into &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Excel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and connect it to real-time market data from some of the world&amp;#x27;s most influential financial information providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based AI startup announced Monday it is releasing &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/advancing-claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude for Excel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing financial analysts to interact with the AI system directly within their spreadsheets ‚Äî the quintessential tool of modern finance. &lt;!-- --&gt;Beyond Excel, select Claude models are also being made available in &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio?market=af"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Copilot Studio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Researcher agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, expanding the integration across Microsoft&amp;#x27;s enterprise AI ecosystem. &lt;!-- --&gt;The integration marks a significant escalation in Anthropic&amp;#x27;s campaign to position itself as the AI platform of choice for banks, asset managers, and insurance companies, markets where precision and regulatory compliance matter far more than creative flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion comes just three months after Anthropic launched its &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Financial Analysis Solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in July, and it signals the company&amp;#x27;s determination to capture market share in an industry &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;projected to spend $97 billion on AI by 2027&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up from $35 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it positions Anthropic to compete directly with &lt;a href="https://microsoft.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî ironically, its partner in this Excel integration ‚Äî which has its own &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel/ai-for-excel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copilot AI assistant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; embedded across its &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Office suite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which counts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/technology/openai-microsoft-deal.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft as its largest investor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Excel has become the new battleground for AI in finance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to build directly into Excel is hardly accidental. Excel remains the lingua franca of finance, the digital workspace where analysts spend countless hours constructing financial models, running valuations, and stress-testing assumptions. By embedding Claude into this environment, Anthropic is meeting financial professionals exactly where they work rather than asking them to toggle between applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude for Excel allows users to work with the AI in a sidebar where it can read, analyze, modify, and create new Excel workbooks while providing full transparency about the actions it takes by tracking and explaining changes and letting users navigate directly to referenced cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transparency feature addresses one of the most persistent anxieties around AI in finance: &lt;a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When billions of dollars ride on a financial model&amp;#x27;s output, analysts need to understand not just the answer but how the AI arrived at it. By showing its work at the cell level, Anthropic is attempting to build the trust necessary for widespread adoption in an industry where careers and fortunes can turn on a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical implementation is sophisticated. Claude can discuss how spreadsheets work, modify them while preserving formula dependencies ‚Äî a notoriously complex task ‚Äî debug cell formulas, populate templates with new data, or build entirely new spreadsheets from scratch. This isn&amp;#x27;t merely a chatbot that answers questions about your data; it&amp;#x27;s a collaborative tool that can actively manipulate the models that drive investment decisions worth trillions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Anthropic is building data moats around its financial AI platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significant than the Excel integration is Anthropic&amp;#x27;s expansion of its connector ecosystem, which now links Claude to live market data and proprietary research from financial information giants. The company added six major new data partnerships spanning the entire spectrum of financial information that professional investors rely upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aiera.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aiera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now provides Claude with real-time earnings call transcripts and summaries of investor events like shareholder meetings, presentations, and conferences. The Aiera connector also enables a data feed from &lt;a href="https://www.thirdbridge.com/en-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Third Bridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gives Claude access to a library of insights interviews, company intelligence, and industry analysis from experts and former executives. &lt;a href="https://www.chronograph.pe/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronograph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives private equity investors operational and financial information for portfolio monitoring and conducting due diligence, including performance metrics, valuations, and fund-level data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.egnyte.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Egnyte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables Claude to securely search permitted data for internal data rooms, investment documents, and approved financial models while maintaining governed access controls. &lt;a href="https://www.lseg.com/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSEG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the London Stock Exchange Group, connects Claude to live market data including fixed income pricing, equities, foreign exchange rates, macroeconomic indicators, and analysts&amp;#x27; estimates of other important financial metrics. &lt;a href="https://www.moodys.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moody&amp;#x27;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides access to proprietary credit ratings, research, and company data covering ownership, financials, and news on more than 600 million public and private companies, supporting work and research in compliance, credit analysis, and business development. &lt;a href="https://www.mtnewswires.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MT Newswires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides Claude with access to the latest global multi-asset class news on financial markets and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These partnerships amount to a land grab for the informational infrastructure that powers modern finance. Previously announced in July, Anthropic had &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;already secured integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.capitaliq.com/CIQDotNet/Login-okta.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://daloopa.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daloopa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.morningstar.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morningstar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factset.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FactSet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchbook.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PitchBook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Snowflake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.databricks.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Databricks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these connectors give Claude access to virtually every category of financial data an analyst might need: fundamental company data, market prices, credit assessments, private company intelligence, alternative data, and breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because the quality of AI outputs depends entirely on the quality of inputs. Generic large language models trained on public internet data simply cannot compete with systems that have direct pipelines to Bloomberg-quality financial information. By securing these partnerships, Anthropic is building moats around its financial services offering that competitors will find difficult to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic calculus here is clear: Anthropic is betting that domain-specific AI systems with privileged access to proprietary data will outcompete general-purpose AI assistants. It&amp;#x27;s a direct challenge to the &amp;quot;one AI to rule them all&amp;quot; approach favored by some competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-configured workflows target the daily grind of Wall Street analysts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of Anthropic&amp;#x27;s announcement involves six new &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; ‚Äî pre-configured workflows for common financial tasks. These skills are Anthropic&amp;#x27;s attempt to productize the workflows of entry-level and mid-level financial analysts, professionals who spend their days building models, processing due diligence documents, and writing research reports. Anthropic has designed skills specifically to automate these time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new skills include building discounted cash flow models complete with full free cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital calculations, scenario toggles, and sensitivity tables. There&amp;#x27;s comparable company analysis featuring valuation multiples and operating metrics that can be easily refreshed with updated data. Claude can now process data room documents into Excel spreadsheets populated with financial information, customer lists, and contract terms. It can create company teasers and profiles for pitch books and buyer lists, perform earnings analyses that use quarterly transcripts and financials to extract important metrics, guidance changes, and management commentary, and produce initiating coverage reports with industry analysis, company deep dives, and valuation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s worth noting that Anthropic&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonnet 4.5 model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now tops the &lt;a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/finance_agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finance Agent benchmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Vals AI at 55.3% accuracy, a metric designed to test AI systems on tasks expected of entry-level financial analysts. A 55% accuracy rate might sound underwhelming, but it is state-of-the-art performance and highlights both the promise and limitations of AI in finance. The technology can clearly handle sophisticated analytical tasks, but it&amp;#x27;s not yet reliable enough to operate autonomously without human oversight ‚Äî a reality that may actually reassure both regulators and the analysts whose jobs might otherwise be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agent Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approach is particularly clever because it packages AI capabilities in terms that financial institutions already understand. Rather than selling generic &amp;quot;AI assistance,&amp;quot; Anthropic is offering solutions to specific, well-defined problems: &amp;quot;You need a DCF model? We have a skill for that. You need to analyze earnings calls? We have a skill for that too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trillion-dollar clients are already seeing massive productivity gains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services strategy appears to be gaining traction with exactly the kind of marquee clients that matter in enterprise sales. The company counts among its clients &lt;a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIA Labs at Bridgewater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aig.com/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American International Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbim.no/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norges Bank Investment Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî Norway&amp;#x27;s $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world&amp;#x27;s largest institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen reported achieving approximately 20% productivity gains, equivalent to 213,000 hours, with portfolio managers and risk departments now able to &amp;quot;seamlessly query our Snowflake data warehouse and analyze earnings calls with unprecedented efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At AIG, CEO Peter Zaffino said the partnership has &amp;quot;compressed the timeline to review business by more than 5x in our early rollouts while simultaneously improving our data accuracy from 75% to over 90%.&amp;quot; If these numbers hold across broader deployments, the productivity implications for the financial services industry are staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#x27;t pilot programs or proof-of-concept deployments; they&amp;#x27;re production implementations at institutions managing trillions of dollars in assets and making underwriting decisions that affect millions of customers. Their public endorsements provide the social proof that typically drives enterprise adoption in conservative industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulatory uncertainty creates both opportunity and risk for AI deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services ambitions unfold against a backdrop of heightened regulatory scrutiny and shifting enforcement priorities. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released guidance requiring lenders to &amp;quot;use specific and accurate reasons when taking adverse actions against consumers&amp;quot; involving AI, and issued additional guidance requiring regulated entities to &amp;quot;evaluate their underwriting models for bias&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;evaluate automated collateral-valuation and appraisal processes in ways that minimize bias.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recommendations-for-responsible-use-of-ai-in-financial-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brookings Institution analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these measures have since been revoked with work stopped or eliminated at the current downsized CFPB under the current administration, creating regulatory uncertainty. The pendulum has swung from the Biden administration&amp;#x27;s cautious approach, exemplified by an &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order on safe AI development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, toward the Trump administration&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;America&amp;#x27;s AI Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which seeks to &amp;quot;cement U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence&amp;quot; through deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regulatory flux creates both opportunities and risks. Financial institutions eager to deploy AI now face less prescriptive federal oversight, potentially accelerating adoption. But the absence of clear guardrails also exposes them to potential liability if AI systems produce discriminatory outcomes, particularly in lending and underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Attorney General recently reached a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-campbell-announces-25-million-settlement-with-student-loan-lender-for-unlawful-practices-through-ai-use-other-consumer-protection-violations"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$2.5 million settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with student loan company Earnest Operations, alleging that its use of AI models resulted in &amp;quot;disparate impact in approval rates and loan terms, specifically disadvantaging Black and Hispanic applicants.&amp;quot; Such cases will likely multiply as AI deployment grows, creating a patchwork of state-level enforcement even as federal oversight recedes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic appears acutely aware of these risks. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/anthropic-rolls-out-financial-ai-tools-target-large-clients-claude/753249/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Banking Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jonathan Pelosi, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s global head of industry for financial services, emphasized that Claude requires a &amp;quot;human in the loop.&amp;quot; The platform, he said, is not intended for autonomous financial decision-making or to provide stock recommendations that users follow blindly. During client onboarding, Pelosi told the publication, Anthropic focuses on training and understanding model limitations, putting guardrails in place so people treat Claude as a helpful technology rather than a replacement for human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition heats up as every major tech company targets finance AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s financial services push comes as AI competition intensifies across the enterprise. &lt;a href="https://openai.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/?zx=1761550720312&amp;amp;no_sw_cr=1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous startups are all vying for position in what may become one of AI&amp;#x27;s most lucrative verticals. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/goldman-sachs-launches-ai-assistant.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced a generative AI assistant to its bankers, traders, and asset managers in January, signaling that major banks may build their own capabilities rather than rely exclusively on third-party providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of domain-specific AI models like &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BloombergGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî trained specifically on financial data ‚Äî suggests the market may fragment between generalized AI assistants and specialized tools. Anthropic&amp;#x27;s strategy appears to stake out a middle ground: general-purpose models, since Claude was not trained exclusively on financial data, enhanced with financial-specific tooling, data access, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#x27;s partnership strategy with implementation consultancies including &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deloitte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KPMG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/leadingedge.html?WT.mc_id=CT3-PL300-DM1-TR1-BR_XB_-OTHERFW_-Brand_Umbrella_Google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496735884&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABTtm-J1jFUwZ3oXf5hR5VenXYQfh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPzHBhDCARIsALlWNG0UNXvoWOQLTYylq3foXvjRNwHOD6SRzXaav5gXQG2APeHyRz5Us34aAn0lEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Slalom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tribe.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TribeAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.turing.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is equally critical. These firms serve as force multipliers, embedding Anthropic&amp;#x27;s technology into their own service offerings and providing the change management expertise that financial institutions need to successfully adopt AI at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;CFOs worry about AI hallucinations and cascading errors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader question is whether AI tools like Claude will genuinely transform financial services productivity or merely shift work around. The PYMNTS Intelligence report &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study_posts/the-agentic-trust-gap-enterprise-cfos-push-pause-on-agentic-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Agentic Trust Gap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; found that chief financial officers remain hesitant about AI agents, with &amp;quot;nagging concern&amp;quot; about hallucinations where &amp;quot;an AI agent can go off script and expose firms to cascading payment errors and other inaccuracies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI&amp;#x27;s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call‚Äîor risk owning the fallout,&amp;quot; the report warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/boardleadership/pdf/2025/2025-survey-boardroom-lens-generative-ai.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 KPMG report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that 70% of board members have developed responsible use policies for employees, with other popular initiatives including implementing a recognized AI risk and governance framework, developing ethical guidelines and training programs for AI developers, and conducting regular AI use audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial services industry faces a delicate balancing act: move too slowly and risk competitive disadvantage as rivals achieve productivity gains; move too quickly and risk operational failures, regulatory penalties, or reputational damage. Speaking at the &lt;a href="https://evidentinsights.com/events/evident-ai-symposium-new-york-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evident AI Symposium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York last week, Ian Glasner, HSBC&amp;#x27;s group head of emerging technology, innovation and ventures, struck an optimistic tone about the sector&amp;#x27;s readiness for AI adoption. &amp;quot;As an industry, we are very well prepared to manage risk,&amp;quot; he said, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/agentic-ai-governance-risk-mitigation-financial-services-banks/803667/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIO Dive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s not overcomplicate this. We just need to be focused on the business use case and the value associated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s latest moves suggest the company sees financial services as a beachhead market where AI&amp;#x27;s value proposition is clear, customers have deep pockets, and the technical requirements play to Claude&amp;#x27;s strengths in reasoning and accuracy. By building Excel integration, securing data partnerships, and pre-packaging common workflows, Anthropic is reducing the friction that typically slows enterprise AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation"&gt;&lt;u&gt; $61.5 billion valuation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company commanded in its March fundraising round ‚Äî up from roughly $16 billion a year earlier ‚Äî suggests investors believe this strategy will work. But the real test will come as these tools move from pilot programs to production deployments across thousands of analysts and billions of dollars in transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services may prove to be AI&amp;#x27;s most demanding proving ground: an industry where mistakes are costly, regulation is stringent, and trust is everything. If Claude can successfully navigate the spreadsheet cells and data feeds of Wall Street without hallucinating a decimal point in the wrong direction, Anthropic will have accomplished something far more valuable than winning another benchmark test. It will have proven that AI can be trusted with the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

She was put on dialysis, which meant that she had to go to the hospital four times a week to have her blood filtered by a machine since her own kidneys could no longer function independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years later, Maxim‚Äôs mother received a kidney transplant. Although the surgery was successful and allowed her to lead a relatively normal life, it wasn‚Äôt the end of his family‚Äôs struggle with kidney disease. It turned out that Maxim had inherited the disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), from her.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;About one in seven Americans has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and about 10% of those CKD cases are due to a genetic condition. Maxim has been obsessed with finding a cure for himself and others ever since he was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maxim‚Äôs ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment occurred in 2021, when Nature Magazine published a study proving that PKD is reversible in mice using CRISPR technology. At the time, he was pursuing his graduate degree in computational biology at Stanford while simultaneously engaging in kidney research under his professor, Vivek Bhalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although Maxim was convinced that gene therapy could reverse PKD, the biggest hurdle was creating a mechanism to deliver the drugs directly to the diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To solve this critical challenge, he founded Nephrogen in 2022, a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Nephrogen is one of the 20 finalists in Startup Battlefield, part of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After three years of development, Maxim claims Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the ‚Äúvehicles‚Äù currently approved by the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The next major step for Nephrogen is to advance its novel delivery mechanism, along with a drug the startup developed, into clinical studies, which Maxim anticipates will begin in 2027. To support this, the company is raising a $4 million seed round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maxim intends to participate in the clinical study himself, given the significant challenges he faces living with PKD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúYou get a lot of back pain. You have to go to the hospital a lot. You are on this drug that‚Äôs supposed to slow the progression, but it doesn‚Äôt really do anything. Just makes you pee all the time,‚Äù he said, adding that there is always a risk that his disease will progress to require dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This makes Nephrogen‚Äôs approach all the more critical, as its success could cure him of PKD entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to hear from Nephrogen firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year‚Äôs Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The scans help doctors detect cancer and track its spread, but the process itself is a logistical nightmare for patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It starts with fasting for four to six hours before coming into the hospital ‚Äî and good luck to you if you live rurally and your local hospital doesn‚Äôt have a PET scanner. When you get to the hospital, you‚Äôre injected with radioactive material, after which you must wait for an hour while it washes through your body. Next, you enter the PET scanner and have to attempt to lie still for 30 minutes while radiologists acquire the image. After that, you have to keep physically away from the elderly, young people, and pregnant women for up to 12 hours because you‚Äôre literally semi-radioactive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another bottleneck? PET scanners are concentrated in major cities because their radioactive tracers must be produced in nearby cyclotrons ‚Äî compact nuclear machines ‚Äî and used within hours, limiting access in rural and regional hospitals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But what if you could use AI to convert CT scans, which are much more accessible and affordable, into PET scans? That‚Äôs the pitch of RADiCAIT, an Oxford spinout that came out of stealth this month with $1.7 million in pre-seed financing. The Boston-based startup, which is at Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, has just opened a $5 million raise to advance its clinical trials. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúWhat we really do is we took the most constrained, complex, and costly medical imaging solution in radiology, and we supplanted it with what is the most accessible, simple and affordable, which is CT,‚Äù Sean Walsh, RADiCAIT‚Äôs CEO, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT‚Äôs secret sauce is its foundational model ‚Äî a generative deep neural network invented in 2021 at the University of Oxford by a team led by the startup‚Äôs co-founder and chief medical information officer, Regent Lee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062164" height="258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Left: CT scan. Middle: AI-generated PET scan from RADiCAIT. Right: Chemical PET scan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;RADiCAIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model learns by comparing CT and PET scans, mapping them, and picking out patterns in how they relate to each other. Sina Shahandeh, RADiCAIT‚Äôs chief technologist, describes it as connecting ‚Äúdistinct physical phenomena‚Äù by translating anatomical structure into physiological function. Then the model is directed to pay extra attention to specific features or aspects of the scans, like certain types of tissue or abnormalities. This focused learning is repeated many times with many different examples, so the model can identify which patterns are clinically important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The final image that goes to doctors for review is created by combining multiple models working together. Shahandeh compares the approach to Google DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized protein structure prediction: Both systems learn to translate one type of biological information into another. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Walsh claims the team at RADiCAIT can mathematically prove that their synthetic or generated PET images are statistically similar to real chemical PET scans. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what our trials show,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat the same quality of decision has been made when the doctor, radiologist, or oncologist is given a chemical PET or [our AI-generated PET].‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT doesn‚Äôt promise to replace the need for PET scans in specific therapeutic settings, like radioligand therapy, which kills cancer cells. But for diagnostic, staging, and monitoring purposes, RADiCAIT‚Äôs technology might make PET scans obsolete.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062165" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-09-at-20.32.17.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;RADiCAIT team, from Left: JP Sampson, COO; Sean Walsh, CEO; Sina Shahendeh, CTO; Regent Lee, CMIO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;RADiCAIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs such a constrained system, there‚Äôs not enough supply to meet demand for diagnostics and theragnostics,‚Äù Walsh said, referring to a medical approach that combines diagnostic imaging (i.e., PET scans) with targeted therapy to treat diseases (i.e., cancer). ‚ÄúSo what we‚Äôre looking to do is soak up that demand on the diagnostic side. PET scanners themselves should pick up the slack on the theragnostic side.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT has already begun clinical pilots specifically for lung cancer testing with major health systems like Mass General Brigham and UCSF Health. The startup is now pursuing an FDA clinical trial ‚Äî a more expensive and involved process that‚Äôs driving RADiCAIT‚Äôs $5 million seed round. Once that‚Äôs approved, the next step will be to do commercial pilots and demonstrate the commercial viability of the product. RADiCAIT also wants to run the same process ‚Äî clinical pilots, clinical trials, commercial pilots ‚Äî for colorectal and lymphoma use cases. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shahandeh said RADiCAIT‚Äôs approach to using AI to yield valid insights without the burdens of difficult and expensive tests is ‚Äúbroadly applicable.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre exploring extensions across radiology,‚Äù Shahandeh added. ‚ÄúExpect to see similar innovations linking domains from materials science to biology, chemistry, and physics wherever nature‚Äôs hidden relationships can be learned.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúWhat we really do is we took the most constrained, complex, and costly medical imaging solution in radiology, and we supplanted it with what is the most accessible, simple and affordable, which is CT,‚Äù Sean Walsh, RADiCAIT‚Äôs CEO, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT‚Äôs secret sauce is its foundational model ‚Äî a generative deep neural network invented in 2021 at the University of Oxford by a team led by the startup‚Äôs co-founder and chief medical information officer, Regent Lee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062164" height="258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Left: CT scan. Middle: AI-generated PET scan from RADiCAIT. Right: Chemical PET scan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;RADiCAIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The model learns by comparing CT and PET scans, mapping them, and picking out patterns in how they relate to each other. Sina Shahandeh, RADiCAIT‚Äôs chief technologist, describes it as connecting ‚Äúdistinct physical phenomena‚Äù by translating anatomical structure into physiological function. Then the model is directed to pay extra attention to specific features or aspects of the scans, like certain types of tissue or abnormalities. This focused learning is repeated many times with many different examples, so the model can identify which patterns are clinically important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The final image that goes to doctors for review is created by combining multiple models working together. Shahandeh compares the approach to Google DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized protein structure prediction: Both systems learn to translate one type of biological information into another. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Walsh claims the team at RADiCAIT can mathematically prove that their synthetic or generated PET images are statistically similar to real chemical PET scans. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what our trials show,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat the same quality of decision has been made when the doctor, radiologist, or oncologist is given a chemical PET or [our AI-generated PET].‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT doesn‚Äôt promise to replace the need for PET scans in specific therapeutic settings, like radioligand therapy, which kills cancer cells. But for diagnostic, staging, and monitoring purposes, RADiCAIT‚Äôs technology might make PET scans obsolete.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3062165" height="510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-09-at-20.32.17.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;RADiCAIT team, from Left: JP Sampson, COO; Sean Walsh, CEO; Sina Shahendeh, CTO; Regent Lee, CMIO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;RADiCAIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs such a constrained system, there‚Äôs not enough supply to meet demand for diagnostics and theragnostics,‚Äù Walsh said, referring to a medical approach that combines diagnostic imaging (i.e., PET scans) with targeted therapy to treat diseases (i.e., cancer). ‚ÄúSo what we‚Äôre looking to do is soak up that demand on the diagnostic side. PET scanners themselves should pick up the slack on the theragnostic side.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;RADiCAIT has already begun clinical pilots specifically for lung cancer testing with major health systems like Mass General Brigham and UCSF Health. The startup is now pursuing an FDA clinical trial ‚Äî a more expensive and involved process that‚Äôs driving RADiCAIT‚Äôs $5 million seed round. Once that‚Äôs approved, the next step will be to do commercial pilots and demonstrate the commercial viability of the product. RADiCAIT also wants to run the same process ‚Äî clinical pilots, clinical trials, commercial pilots ‚Äî for colorectal and lymphoma use cases. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Shahandeh said RADiCAIT‚Äôs approach to using AI to yield valid insights without the burdens of difficult and expensive tests is ‚Äúbroadly applicable.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre exploring extensions across radiology,‚Äù Shahandeh added. ‚ÄúExpect to see similar innovations linking domains from materials science to biology, chemistry, and physics wherever nature‚Äôs hidden relationships can be learned.‚Äù&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
