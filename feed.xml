At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like &lt;em&gt;Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans&lt;/em&gt; colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Two people in white coats and hard hats look up at steel columns inside a warehouse." class="wp-image-1131947" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Endolith-laboratory-team-.jpg?w=1794" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endolith scientists use columns filled with copper ore to test the firm’s method of actively managing microbes in the ore to increase metal extraction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A large piece of machinery hovers over a mound of red dirt." class="wp-image-1131948" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nuton_12_2025-41.jpg?w=2000" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuton is testing an improved bioleaching process at Gunnison Copper’s Johnson Camp mine in Arizona.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of &lt;em&gt;Gluconobacter oxydans&lt;/em&gt; to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life.

For companies moving high volumes of goods, tracking no longer ends when a package leaves the warehouse. Customers expect real-time updates, flexible delivery options, and returns that do not turn into support tickets or delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pressure is pushing logistics firms to rethink how tracking and returns operate at scale, especially across complex supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where artificial intelligence is starting to move from pilot projects into daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx plans to roll out AI-powered tracking and returns tools designed for enterprise shippers, according to a report by &lt;em&gt;PYMNTS&lt;/em&gt;. The tools are aimed at automating routine customer service tasks, improving visibility into shipments, and reducing friction when packages need to be rerouted or sent back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on consumer-facing chatbots, the effort centres on operational workflows that sit behind the scenes. These are the systems enterprise customers rely on to manage exceptions, returns, and delivery changes without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-fedex-is-applying-ai-to-package-tracking"&gt;How FedEx is applying AI to package tracking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional tracking systems tell customers where a package is and when it might arrive. AI-powered tracking takes a step further by utilising historical delivery data, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and network constraints to flag potential delays before they happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;PYMNTS&lt;/em&gt; report, FedEx’s AI tools are designed to help enterprise shippers anticipate issues earlier in the delivery process. Instead of reacting to missed delivery windows, shippers may be able to reroute packages or notify customers ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For businesses that ship thousands of parcels per day, that shift matters. Small improvements in prediction accuracy can reduce support calls, lower refund rates, and improve customer trust, particularly in retail, healthcare, and manufacturing supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach also reflects a broader trend in enterprise software, in which AI is being embedded into existing systems rather than introduced as standalone tools. The goal is not to replace logistics teams, but to minimise the number of manual decisions they need to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-returns-as-an-operational-problem-not-a-customer-issue"&gt;Returns as an operational problem, not a customer issue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returns are one of the most expensive parts of logistics. For enterprise shippers, particularly those in e-commerce, returns affect warehouse capacity, inventory planning, and transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;PYMNTS&lt;/em&gt;, FedEx’s AI-enabled returns tools aim to automate parts of the returns process, including label generation, routing decisions, and status updates. Companies that use AI to determine the most efficient return path may be able to reduce delays and avoid returning things to the wrong facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is less about convenience and more about operational discipline. Returns that sit idle or move through the wrong channel create cost and uncertainty across the supply chain. AI systems trained on past return patterns can help standardise decisions that were previously handled case by case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise customers, this type of automation supports scale. As return volumes fluctuate, especially during peak seasons, systems that adjust automatically reduce the need for temporary staffing or manual overrides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-fedex-s-ai-tracking-approach-says-about-enterprise-adoption"&gt;What FedEx’s AI tracking approach says about enterprise adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stands out in FedEx’s approach is how narrowly focused the AI use case is. There are no broad claims about transformation or reinvention. The emphasis is on reducing friction in processes that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors how other large organisations are adopting AI internally. In a separate context, Microsoft described a similar pattern in its article. The company outlined how AI tools were rolled out gradually, with clear limits, governance rules, and feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft’s case focused on knowledge work and FedEx’s on logistics operations, the underlying lesson is the same. AI adoption tends to work best when applied to specific activities with measurable results rather than broad promises of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For logistics firms, those advantages include fewer delivery exceptions, lower return handling costs, and better coordination between shipping partners and enterprise clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-signals-for-enterprise-customers"&gt;What this signals for enterprise customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For end-user companies, FedEx’s move signals that logistics providers are investing in AI as a way to support more complex shipping demands. As supply chains become more distributed, visibility and predictability become harder to maintain without automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven tracking and returns could also change how businesses measure logistics performance. Companies may focus less on delivery speed and more on how quickly issues are recognised and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift could influence procurement decisions, contract structures, and service-level agreements. Enterprise customers may start asking not just where a shipment is, but how well a provider anticipates problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx’s plans reflect a quieter phase of enterprise AI adoption. The focus is less on experimentation and more on integration. These systems are not designed to draw attention but to reduce noise in operations that customers only notice when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Liam Kevan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: PepsiCo is using AI to rethink how factories are designed and updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

As return volumes fluctuate, especially during peak seasons, systems that adjust automatically reduce the need for temporary staffing or manual overrides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-fedex-s-ai-tracking-approach-says-about-enterprise-adoption"&gt;What FedEx’s AI tracking approach says about enterprise adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stands out in FedEx’s approach is how narrowly focused the AI use case is. There are no broad claims about transformation or reinvention. The emphasis is on reducing friction in processes that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors how other large organisations are adopting AI internally. In a separate context, Microsoft described a similar pattern in its article. The company outlined how AI tools were rolled out gradually, with clear limits, governance rules, and feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft’s case focused on knowledge work and FedEx’s on logistics operations, the underlying lesson is the same. AI adoption tends to work best when applied to specific activities with measurable results rather than broad promises of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For logistics firms, those advantages include fewer delivery exceptions, lower return handling costs, and better coordination between shipping partners and enterprise clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-signals-for-enterprise-customers"&gt;What this signals for enterprise customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For end-user companies, FedEx’s move signals that logistics providers are investing in AI as a way to support more complex shipping demands. As supply chains become more distributed, visibility and predictability become harder to maintain without automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-driven tracking and returns could also change how businesses measure logistics performance. Companies may focus less on delivery speed and more on how quickly issues are recognised and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift could influence procurement decisions, contract structures, and service-level agreements. Enterprise customers may start asking not just where a shipment is, but how well a provider anticipates problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedEx’s plans reflect a quieter phase of enterprise AI adoption. The focus is less on experimentation and more on integration. These systems are not designed to draw attention but to reduce noise in operations that customers only notice when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Liam Kevan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: PepsiCo is using AI to rethink how factories are designed and updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Holmes notes that around 80 percent of new innovation projects fail, often because financial opacity during the pilot phase masks future liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a pilot demonstrates that automating a process saves, say, 100 hours a month, leadership thinks that’s really successful,” says Holmes. “But what it fails to track is that the pilot sometimes is running on over-provisioned infrastructure, so it looks like it performs really well. But you wouldn’t over-provision to that degree during a real production rollout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving that workload to production changes the calculus. The requirements for compute, storage, and data transfer increase. “API calls can multiply, exceptions and edge cases appear at volume that might have been out of scope for the pilot phase, and then support overheads just grow as well,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent this, organisations must track the marginal cost at scale. This involves monitoring unit economics, such as the cost per customer served or cost per transaction. If the cost per customer increases as the customer base grows, the business model is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, effective scaling should see these unit costs decrease. Holmes cites a case study from Liberty Mutual where the insurer was able to find around $2.5 million of savings by bringing in consumption metrics and “not just looking at labour hours that they were saving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, financial accountability cannot sit solely with the finance department. Holmes advocates for putting governance “back in the hands of the developers into their development tools and workloads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration with infrastructure-as-code tools like HashiCorp Terraform and GitHub allows organisations to enforce policies during deployment. Teams can spin up resources programmatically with immediate cost estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than deploying things and then fixing them up, which gets into the whole whack-a-mole kind of problem,” Holmes explains, companies can verify they are “deploying the right things at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scaling intelligent automation, tension often simmers between the CFO, who focuses on return on investment, and the Head of Automation, who tracks operational metrics like hours saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This translation challenge is precisely what TBM (Technology Business Management) and Apptio are designed to solve,” says Holmes. “It’s having a common language between technology and finance and with the business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TBM taxonomy provides a standardised framework to reconcile these views. It maps technical resources (such as compute, storage, and labour) into IT towers and further up to business capabilities. This structure translates technical inputs into business outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t necessarily know what goes into all the IT layers underneath it,” Holmes says, describing the business user’s perspective. “But because we’ve got this taxonomy, I can get a detailed bill that tells me about my service consumption and precisely which costs are driving&amp;nbsp; it to be more expensive as I consume more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-legacy-debt-and-budgeting-for-the-long-term"&gt;Addressing legacy debt and budgeting for the long-term&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations burdened by legacy ERP systems face a binary choice: automation as a patch, or as a bridge to modernisation.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia utilised a TCO model across 2,000 different applications – of various maturity stages – to assess their full lifecycle costs. This analysis included hidden costs such as infrastructure, labour, and the engineering time required to keep automation running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because of something’s legacy doesn’t mean you have to retire it,” says Holmes. “Some of those legacy systems are worth maintaining just because the value is so good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, calculating the cost of the automation wrappers required to keep an old system functional reveals a different reality. “Sometimes when you add up the TCO approach, and you’re including all these automation layers around it, you suddenly realise, the real cost of keeping that old system alive is not just the old system, it’s those extra layers,” Holmes argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding sticker shock requires a budgeting strategy that balances variable costs with long-term commitments.

&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/sAbRvxS84gKtil9BEaqXP.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! This is the second part of our series on training efficient text-to-image models from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first post of this series, we introduced our goal: training a competitive text-to-image foundation model entirely from scratch, in the open, and at scale. We focused primarily on architectural choices and motivated the core design decisions behind our model &lt;strong&gt;PRX&lt;/strong&gt;.
We also released an early, small (1.2B parameters) version of the model as a preview of what we are building (go try it if you haven't already 😉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we shift our focus from architecture to training. &lt;strong&gt;The goal is to document what actually moved the needle for us&lt;/strong&gt; when trying to make models train faster, converge more reliably, and learn better representations. The field is moving quickly and the list of “training tricks” keeps growing, so rather than attempting an exhaustive survey, we structured this as an experimental logbook: we reproduce (or adapt) a set of recent ideas, implement them in a consistent setup, and report how they affect optimization and convergence in practice. Finally, we do not only report these techniques in isolation; we also explore which ones remain useful when combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, &lt;strong&gt;we will publish the full training recipe as code&lt;/strong&gt;, including the experiments in this post. &lt;strong&gt;We will also run and report on a public "speedrun"&lt;/strong&gt; where we put the best pieces together into a single configuration and stress-test it end-to-end. This exercise will serve both as a stress test of our current training pipeline and as a concrete demonstration of how far careful training design can go under tight constraints. 
If you haven’t already, we invite you to join our Discord to continue the discussion. A significant part of this project has been shaped by exchanges with community members, and we place a high value on external feedback, ablations, and alternative interpretations of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		The Baseline
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before introducing any training-efficiency techniques, we first establish a clean reference run. This baseline is intentionally simple. It uses standard components, avoids auxiliary objectives, and does not rely on architectural shortcuts or tricks to save compute resources. Its role is to serve as a stable point of comparison for all subsequent experiments.&lt;br /&gt;Concretely, this is a &lt;strong&gt;pure Flow Matching&lt;/strong&gt; (Lipman et al., 2022) training setup (as introduced in Part 1) with no extra objectives and no architectural speed hacks.
We will use the small PRX-1.2B model we presented in the first post of this series (single stream architecture with global attention for the image tokens and text tokens) as our baseline and train it in Flux VAE latent space, keeping the configuration fixed across all comparisons unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline training setup is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Padding mask&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EMA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Disabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This baseline configuration provides a transparent and reproducible anchor. It allows us to attribute observed improvements and regressions to specific training interventions, rather than to shifting hyperparameters or hidden setup changes.
Throughout the remainder of this post, every technique is evaluated against this reference with a single guiding question in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does this modification improve convergence or training efficiency relative to the baseline?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		Benchmarking Metrics
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep this post grounded, we rely on a small set of metrics to monitor checkpoints over time. None of them is a perfect proxy for perceived image quality, but together they provide a practical scoreboard while we iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):&lt;/strong&gt; (Heusel et al., 2017) Measures how close the distributions of generated and real images are, using Inception-v3 feature statistics (mean and covariance). Lower values typically correlate with higher sample fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD):&lt;/strong&gt; (Jayasumana et al., 2024) Measures the distance between real and generated image distributions using CLIP image embeddings and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Unlike FID, CMMD does not assume Gaussian feature distributions and can be more sample-efficient; in practice it often tracks perceptual quality better than FID, though it is still an imperfect proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DINOv2 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DINO-MMD):&lt;/strong&gt; Same MMD-based distance as CMMD, but computed on DINOv2 (Oquab et al. 2023) image embeddings instead of CLIP. This provides a complementary view of distribution shift under a self-supervised vision backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network throughput:&lt;/strong&gt; Average number of samples processed per second (samples/s), as a measure of end-to-end training efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the scoreboard defined, we can now dive into the methods we explored, grouped into four buckets: &lt;strong&gt;Representation Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Training Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Token Routing and Sparsification&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Representation Alignment
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion and flow models are typically trained with a single objective: predict a noise-like target (or vector field) from a corrupted input. Early in training, that one objective is doing two jobs at once: it must build a useful internal representation and learn to denoise on top of it. Representation alignment makes this explicit by keeping the denoising objective and adding an auxiliary loss that directly supervises intermediate features using a strong, frozen vision encoder. This tends to speed up early learning and bring the model’s features closer to those of modern self-supervised encoders. As a result, you often need less compute to hit the same quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful way to view it is to decompose the denoiser into an implicit encoder that produces intermediate hidden states, and a decoder that maps those states to the denoising target. The claim is that representation learning is the bottleneck: diffusion and flow transformers do learn discriminative features, but they lag behind foundation vision encoders when training is compute-limited. Therefore, borrowing a powerful representation space can make the denoising problem easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the student is trained to produce &lt;em&gt;noise-robust, data-consistent patch representations&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so later layers can focus on predicting the vector field and generating details rather than rediscovering a semantic scaffold from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We ran REPA on top of our baseline PRX training, using two frozen teachers: &lt;strong&gt;DINOv2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DINOv3&lt;/strong&gt; (Siméoni et al., 2025). The pattern was very consistent: &lt;strong&gt;adding alignment improves quality metrics&lt;/strong&gt;, and the stronger teacher helps more, at the cost of a bit of speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/komSJyY0PAWwwC90ckmin.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-Dinov3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-Dinov2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the quality metrics, both teachers improve over the baseline. The effect is strongest with DINOv3, which achieves the best overall numbers in this run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REPA is not free: we pay for an extra frozen teacher forward and the patch-level similarity loss, which shows up as a throughput drop from &lt;strong&gt;3.95 batches/s&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;3.66&lt;/strong&gt; (DINOv2) or &lt;strong&gt;3.46&lt;/strong&gt; (DINOv3). In other words, DINOv3 prioritizes maximum representation quality at the cost of slower training, while DINOv2 offers a more efficient tradeoff, still delivering substantial gains with a smaller slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our practical takeaway is that &lt;strong&gt;REPA is a strong lever for text-to-image training&lt;/strong&gt;. In our setup, the throughput trade-off is real and the &lt;em&gt;net speedup&lt;/em&gt; (time required to reach a given level of image quality) felt a bit less dramatic than what the authors of the paper report on ImageNet-style, class-conditioned generation. That said, the &lt;strong&gt;quality gains are still clearly significant&lt;/strong&gt;. Qualitatively, we also saw the difference early: after ~100K steps, samples trained with alignment tended to lock in &lt;strong&gt;cleaner global structure and more coherent layouts&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes it easy to see why REPA (and alignment variants more broadly) have become a go-to ingredient in modern T2I training recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		iREPA (Singh et al., 2025)
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural follow-up to REPA is: &lt;em&gt;what exactly should we be aligning?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;iREPA&lt;/strong&gt; argues that the answer is &lt;strong&gt;spatial structure&lt;/strong&gt;, not global semantics. Across a large sweep of 27 vision encoders, the authors find that ImageNet-style “global” quality (e.g., linear-probe accuracy on patch tokens) is only weakly predictive of downstream generation quality under REPA, while simple measures of &lt;strong&gt;patch-token spatial self-similarity&lt;/strong&gt; correlate much more strongly with FID. Based on that diagnosis, iREPA makes two tiny but targeted changes to the REPA recipe to better preserve and transfer spatial information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the usual MLP projection head with a lightweight &lt;strong&gt;3×3 convolutional projection&lt;/strong&gt; operating on the patch grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a &lt;strong&gt;spatial normalization&lt;/strong&gt; to teacher patch tokens that removes a global overlay (mean across spatial locations) to increase local contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite representing  “less than 4 lines of code”, these tweaks consistently speed up convergence and improve quality across encoders, model sizes, and even REPA-adjacent training recipes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, we observed a similar kind of boost when applying the iREPA spatial tweaks on top of &lt;strong&gt;DINOv2&lt;/strong&gt;: convergence was a bit smoother and the metrics improved more steadily over the first 100K steps. Interestingly, the same changes did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; transfer as cleanly when applied on top of a &lt;strong&gt;DINOv3 teacher&lt;/strong&gt; and they tended to degrade performance rather than help. We do not want to over-interpret that result: this could easily be an interaction with our specific architecture, resolution/patching, loss weighting, or even small implementation details. Still, given this inconsistency across teachers, we will likely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include these tweaks in our default recipe, even if they remain an interesting option to revisit when tuning for a specific setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/P6pNA1lFjxwWyqF9p88od.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		About Using REPA During the Full Training:
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;em&gt;REPA Works Until It Doesn't: Early-Stopped, Holistic Alignment Supercharges Diffusion Training&lt;/em&gt; (Wang et al., 2025) highlights a key caveat: REPA is a powerful &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; accelerator, but it can plateau or even become a brake later in training. The authors describe a &lt;strong&gt;capacity mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the generative model starts fitting the full data distribution (especially high-frequency details), forcing it to stay close to a frozen recognition encoder’s lower-dimensional embedding manifold becomes constraining. Their practical takeaway is simple: keep alignment for the “burn-in” phase, then &lt;strong&gt;turn it off&lt;/strong&gt; with a stage-wise schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the same qualitative pattern in our own runs. When training our preview model, &lt;strong&gt;removing REPA after ~200K steps&lt;/strong&gt; noticeably improved the &lt;em&gt;overall feel&lt;/em&gt; of image quality, textures, micro-contrast, and fine detail continued to sharpen instead of looking slightly muted. For that reason, we also recommend treating representation alignment as a transient scaffold. Use it to get fast early progress, then &lt;strong&gt;drop it after a while&lt;/strong&gt; once the model’s own generative features have caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Alignment in the Token Latent Space
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, “alignment” meant &lt;strong&gt;regularizing the generator’s internal features&lt;/strong&gt; against a frozen teacher while treating the tokenizer / latent space as fixed. A more direct lever is to &lt;strong&gt;shape the latent space itself&lt;/strong&gt; so the representation presented to the flow backbone is intrinsically easier to model, without sacrificing the reconstruction fidelity needed for editing and downstream workflows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPA-E&lt;/strong&gt; (Leng et al., 2025) makes this concrete.  Its starting point is a failure mode: if you simply backprop the diffusion / flow loss into the VAE, the tokenizer quickly learns a pathologically easy latent for the denoiser, which can even degrade final generation quality. REPA-E’s fix is a two-signal training recipe: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep the diffusion loss, but apply a stop-gradient so it only updates the latent diffusion model (not the VAE); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update both the VAE and the diffusion model using an end-to-end REPA alignment loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these two tricks, the tokenizer is explicitly optimized to produce latents that yield higher alignment and empirically better generations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 AE work frames latent design as a trade-off between learnability, quality, and compression.Their core argument is that improving learnability requires injecting semantic structure into the representation, rather than treating the tokenizer as a pure compression module. This motivates retraining the latent space to explicitly target “better learnability and higher image quality at the same time". They do not share the full recipe, but they do clearly state the key idea: make the AE’s latent space more learnable by adding semantic or representation alignment, and explicitly point to REPA-style alignment with a frozen vision encoder as the mechanism they build on and integrate into the FLUX.2 AE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To probe alignment in the latent space, we compared two &lt;strong&gt;pretrained autoencoders&lt;/strong&gt; as drop-in tokenizers for the same flow backbone: a &lt;strong&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/strong&gt; (where we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; add the REPA alignment objective, as in the paper) and the &lt;strong&gt;Flux2-AE&lt;/strong&gt; (where we &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; add REPA, following their recommendation). The results were, honestly, extremely impressive, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In samples, the gap is immediately visible: generations show more coherent global structure and cleaner layouts, with far fewer “early training” artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.09&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;12.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first striking point is that both latent-space interventions lower the FID by ~6 points (18.20 to ~12.08), which is a much larger jump than what we typically get from “just” aligning intermediate features. This strongly supports the core idea: if the tokenizer produces a representation that is intrinsically more learnable, the flow model benefits everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two AEs then behave quite differently in the details. &lt;strong&gt;Flux2-AE&lt;/strong&gt; dominates most metrics (very low CMMD and DINO_MMD, but it comes with a huge throughput penalty: batches/sec drops from &lt;strong&gt;3.95  to 1.79&lt;/strong&gt;. In our case this slowdown is explained by practical factors they also emphasize: the model is simply heavier, and it also produces a &lt;strong&gt;larger latent (32 channels)&lt;/strong&gt;, which increases the amount of work the diffusion backbone has to do per step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/strong&gt; is the “balanced” option: it reaches essentially the same FID as Flux2-AE while keeping throughput much closer to the baseline (&lt;strong&gt;3.39 batches/sec&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

		Training Objectives: Beyond Vanilla Flow Matching
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture gets you capacity, but the training objective is what decides how that capacity is used. In practice, small changes to the loss often have outsized effects on convergence speed, conditional fidelity, and how quickly a model “locks in” global structure. In the sections below, we will go through the objectives we tested on top of our baseline rectified flow setup, starting with a simple but surprisingly effective modification: Contrastive Flow Matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Contrastive Flow Matching (Stoica et al., 2025)
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow matching has a nice property in the unconditional case: trajectories are implicitly encouraged to be unique (flows should not intersect). But once we move to conditional generation (class- or text-conditioned), different conditions can still induce overlapping flows, which empirically shows up as “averaging” behavior: weaker conditional specificity, and muddier global structure. Contrastive flow matching addresses this directly by adding a contrastive term that pushes conditional flows away from other flows in the batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img alt="PRX block" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/vhLpYTMmLPaXOlYTnawF6.png" width="600" /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Contrastive flow matching makes class-conditional flows more distinct, reducing overlap seen in standard flow matching, and produces higher-quality images that better represent each class. Figure from arXiv:2506.05350.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given training triplet &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;(x, y, \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, standard conditional flow matching trains the model velocity &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;θ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v_\theta(x_t,t,y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;θ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to match the target transport direction. Contrastive flow matching keeps that positive term, but additionally samples a &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; pair &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the batch and penalizes the model if its predicted flow is also compatible with that other trajectory.

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;[&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;∈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; controls the strength of the “push-away” term. Intuitively: &lt;strong&gt;match your own trajectory, and be incompatible with someone else’s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors show that contrastive flow matching produces &lt;strong&gt;more discriminative trajectories&lt;/strong&gt; and that this translates into both &lt;strong&gt;quality and efficiency gains&lt;/strong&gt;: faster convergence (reported up to &lt;strong&gt;9× fewer training iterations&lt;/strong&gt; to reach similar FID) and fewer sampling steps (reported up to &lt;strong&gt;5× fewer denoising steps&lt;/strong&gt;) on &lt;strong&gt;ImageNet&lt;/strong&gt; (Deng et al. 2009) and &lt;strong&gt;CC3M&lt;/strong&gt;(Sharma et al., 2018) experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key advantage is that the objective is almost a drop-in replacement: you keep the usual flow-matching loss, then add a single contrastive “push-away” term using other samples in the same batch as negatives which provides the extra supervision without introducing additional model passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Contrastive-FM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;20.03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this run, contrastive flow matching yields a small but measurable improvement on the representation-driven metrics: CMMD goes from &lt;strong&gt;0.41 → 0.40&lt;/strong&gt; and DINO-MMD from &lt;strong&gt;0.39 → 0.36&lt;/strong&gt;. The magnitude of the gain is smaller than what the paper reports on ImageNet, which is not too surprising: text conditioning is much more complex than discrete classes, and the training data distribution is likely less “separable” than ImageNet, making the contrastive signal harder to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see an improvement in FID in this specific experiment (it slightly worsens), but the &lt;strong&gt;throughput cost is negligible&lt;/strong&gt; in practice (3.95 → 3.75 batches/sec). Given the simplicity of the change and the consistent movement in the right direction for the conditioning/representation metrics, we will likely still keep contrastive flow matching in our training pipeline as a low-cost regularizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to Basics: Let Denoising Generative Models Denoise&lt;/em&gt; is probably one of our favorite recent papers in the diffusion space because it is not a new trick but a reset: stop asking the network to predict off-manifold quantities (noise or velocity) and just let it denoise.
Most modern diffusion and flow models train the network to predict &lt;strong&gt;noise &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;mixed quantity&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;velocity &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Under the manifold assumption, natural images live on a low-dimensional manifold, while &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are inherently &lt;strong&gt;off-manifold&lt;/strong&gt;, so predicting them can be a harder learning problem than it looks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Under the manifold assumption, clean images lie on the data manifold while noise and velocity do not. Thus training the model to predict clean images is fundamentally easier than training it to predict noise-like targets. Figure from arXiv:2511.13720.&lt;/sub&gt;

class="mclose delimcenter"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size2"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formulation makes the learning problem substantially easier in high dimensions: instead of predicting noise or velocity (which are essentially unconstrained in pixel space), the network predicts the clean image &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, i.e., something that lies on the data manifold. In practice, this makes it feasible to train large-patch Transformers directly on pixels without a VAE or tokenizer while keeping optimization stable and the total number of tokens manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first evaluated &lt;strong&gt;x-prediction&lt;/strong&gt; in the same setting as the rest of our objective experiments, namely &lt;strong&gt;training in the FLUX latent space at 256×256 resolution&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/62As0PavSB4rxTIm-OHYY.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X-Pred&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regime, the benefit of x-prediction is &lt;strong&gt;unclear&lt;/strong&gt;. While &lt;strong&gt;FID improves slightly&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the baseline, both &lt;strong&gt;CMMD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DINO-MMD&lt;/strong&gt; degrade noticeably, and throughput is unchanged. This suggests that, when working in an already well-structured latent space, predicting clean images instead of velocity does not consistently dominate the baseline objective, and can even hurt representation-level alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this experiment is not where x-prediction really shines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting part is that &lt;strong&gt;x-prediction stabilizes high-dimensional training&lt;/strong&gt;, making it feasible to use &lt;strong&gt;larger patches&lt;/strong&gt; and denoise &lt;strong&gt;directly in pixel space&lt;/strong&gt;, without a VAE, at much higher resolutions. Using JiT, we trained a model &lt;strong&gt;directly on 1024×1024 images&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;32×32 patches&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of operating in a compressed latent space. Despite the much higher resolution and the absence of a tokenizer, optimization remained stable and fast. We reached &lt;strong&gt;FID 17.42&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;DINO_MMD 0.56&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;CMMD 0.71&lt;/strong&gt; with a throughput of &lt;strong&gt;1.33 batches/sec&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are remarkable: training directly on 1024×1024 images is only about &lt;strong&gt;3× slower&lt;/strong&gt; than training in a 256×256 latent space, while operating on raw pixels. This strongly supports the core claim of &lt;em&gt;Back to Basics&lt;/em&gt;: letting the model predict clean images makes the learning problem significantly easier, and opens the door to high-resolution, tokenizer-free text-to-image training without prohibitive compute costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we plan to use this formulation as the backbone of our upcoming &lt;strong&gt;speedrun experiments&lt;/strong&gt;, to see how far we can push it when combined with the other efficiency and sparsification techniques discussed above. The main downside for now is that this approach does not let us benefit from the very nice properties of the &lt;strong&gt;FLUX.2 VAE&lt;/strong&gt;; exploring whether some form of alignment or hybrid training could make these two worlds compatible is an open direction we plan to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		Token Routing and Sparsification to Reduce Compute Costs
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, most of the techniques we discussed focus on making &lt;strong&gt;each training step more effective&lt;/strong&gt;: improving the objective, shaping the representations, or accelerating convergence. The next lever is orthogonal: &lt;strong&gt;make each step cheaper&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For  diffusion and flow transformers, the dominant cost is running deep transformer stacks over a large set of image/latent tokens where attention scales poorly with sequence length. &lt;em&gt;Token sparsification&lt;/em&gt; methods target this directly by ensuring that only a subset of tokens pays the full compute price in the expensive parts of the network, while still preserving enough information flow to keep quality high.&lt;br /&gt;Most masking approaches accelerate training by &lt;strong&gt;removing tokens from the forward pass&lt;/strong&gt;, then asking the model to hallucinate the missing content from learned placeholders. That works surprisingly well, but it violates the spirit of iterative denoising. Instead of refining all the content in each step, we are reconstructing parts from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent papers illustrate a cleaner alternative: instead of deleting information, they reorganize where compute is spent. &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; share the same high-level objective of avoiding full-depth computation for every token at every layer, but they pursue it through complementary strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt;'s (Krause et al., 2025) core idea is to replace compute reduction through information loss, such as dropping or masking tokens, with compute reduction through information transport using token routing. It introduces a &lt;strong&gt;route&lt;/strong&gt;: for each training sample, it randomly selects a fraction of tokens and &lt;em&gt;temporarily bypasses&lt;/em&gt; a contiguous chunk of layers, then &lt;strong&gt;re-injects those tokens later&lt;/strong&gt;. Tokens are not discarded. Instead, they avoid paying the cost of full depth.
Concretely, for a denoiser with a stack of blocks &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_0, \dots, L_{B-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="minner"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, TREAD defines a route &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mspace&gt;&lt;/mspace&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;r_{i\\to j}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace mtight newline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (start layer &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, end layer &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). A subset of tokens follows the cheap path (identity) across &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_i,\dots,L_j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="minner"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, while the rest follows the normal full computation. Then both streams merge again at &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
In practice, the paper shows that routing up to &lt;strong&gt;50% of tokens&lt;/strong&gt; remains effective, while higher rates begin to degrade quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; (Park et al., 2025) extends this approach by introducing sparsity in the most computationally expensive parts of the network, while preserving a dense information pathway. Its recipe is intentionally structured: run &lt;strong&gt;dense early layers&lt;/strong&gt; over all tokens to build reliable low-level features, then keep only a subset of tokens through the &lt;strong&gt;sparse middle layers&lt;/strong&gt; where compute is heaviest, and finally go &lt;strong&gt;dense again&lt;/strong&gt; by re-expanding and &lt;strong&gt;fusing&lt;/strong&gt; sparse deep features with a &lt;strong&gt;dense residual stream&lt;/strong&gt; from the early layers, before producing the output. The key distinction from TREAD is where robustness comes from: TREAD keeps tokens “present” but shallower (routing), whereas SPRINT allows many tokens to be &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; in the middle blocks, relying on the dense residual path to preserve full-resolution information. This is what enables &lt;strong&gt;more aggressive sparsification&lt;/strong&gt; in practice. The paper explores drop ratios around &lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt;, versus ~50% for TREAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;SPRINT goes beyond TREAD by dropping most tokens in the middle layers while keeping a dense residual path to preserve full-resolution information. Figure from arXiv:/2510.21986.&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under our standard 256×256 latent setup, both methods deliver the primary benefit we were targeting. TREAD goes from 3.95 → 4.11 batches/sec, and SPRINT pushes it a bit further to 4.20 batches/sec. The cost is that under our evaluation protocol, this extra throughput comes with a clear loss in quality: FID rises from 18.20 to 21.61 (TREAD) and 22.56 (SPRINT), with the same pattern observed in CMMD and DINO-MMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken at face value, routing yields a modest &lt;strong&gt;~7–9% throughput gain&lt;/strong&gt;, but it comes with worse metrics in this benchmark, with &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; (the more aggressive scheme) degrading quality slightly more than &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important caveat is that &lt;strong&gt;token-sparse / routed models tend to score worse under vanilla Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)&lt;/strong&gt;, and this effect is likely amplified here because these runs are still relatively &lt;strong&gt;undertrained&lt;/strong&gt; in our setting. The authors of &lt;em&gt;Guiding Token-Sparse Diffusion Models&lt;/em&gt; (Krause et al., 2025) argue this is partly an evaluation mismatch: routing changes the model’s effective capacity, and plain “conditional vs. unconditional” CFG often becomes less effective, which can artificially reduce quality. We deliberately did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; use specialized guidance schemes to keep our benchmark consistent across methods, and at this stage it would also not be very meaningful to treat the sparse model as a “bad version of itself” for guidance. As a result, we consider these numbers directionally useful, but still &lt;strong&gt;pessimistic&lt;/strong&gt; and worth interpreting with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;256×256&lt;/strong&gt;, routing only gave modest gains because the model processes relatively few tokens. At &lt;strong&gt;1024×1024&lt;/strong&gt;, the picture changes completely. With &lt;strong&gt;1024 tokens&lt;/strong&gt;, routing finally targets the dominant cost, and the results are striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TREAD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;14.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.89&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; deliver &lt;strong&gt;large throughput gains&lt;/strong&gt; over the dense baseline, with SPRINT pushing speed the furthest. More importantly, this time the gains do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; come at the expense of quality but quite the opposite. &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; in particular stands out, with a dramatic drop in FID (&lt;strong&gt;17.42 → 14.10&lt;/strong&gt;) alongside strong improvements in CMMD and DINO-MMD. &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; is slightly more aggressive and a bit noisier in quality, but still clearly improves over the baseline while being the fastest option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is the regime where token routing really shines: &lt;strong&gt;high resolution, many tokens, and JiT-style pixel-space training&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, routing is no longer a marginal optimization—it’s a major lever that improves both &lt;strong&gt;how fast&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;how well&lt;/strong&gt; the model trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Data
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After covering representation alignment, the core training objective, and token routing, we turned to the fourth axis that kept constantly mattered in practice: &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;. We found that the choice of training data, including how it is described through captions, can influence the trajectory of a training run as much as optimization techniques. Below are three concrete data experiments that consistently moved the needle in our setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Long vs. Short Captions
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captions are an essential part of the training set: for a text-to-image model, they are not just metadata, they are the supervision. The DALL·E 3 (Betker et al., 2023) research paper showed that richer captions can be one of the strongest levers for improving training signal and prompt-following.
To isolate the effect in our setup, we kept everything else fixed and changed only the caption style to compare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, descriptive captions (our baseline): multi-clause captions that mention composition, attributes, lighting, materials, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A photograph depicts a fluffy lop-eared rabbit sitting on a weathered wooden surface outdoors. The rabbit is predominantly white with patches of light brown and tan fur, particularly on its head and ears. Its ears droop noticeably, and its fur appears soft and thick. The rabbit's eyes are dark and expressive. It is positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the left of the frame. Behind the rabbit, slightly out of focus, is a miniature dark red metal wheelbarrow. A partially visible orange apple sits to the left of the rabbit. Fallen autumn leaves, predominantly reddish-brown, are scattered around the rabbit and apple on the wooden surface. The background is a blurred but visible expanse of green grass, suggesting an outdoor setting. The lighting is soft and natural, likely diffused daylight, casting no harsh shadows. The overall atmosphere is calm, peaceful, and autumnal. The aesthetic is rustic and charming, with a focus on the rabbit as the main subject. The color palette is muted and natural, consisting mainly of whites, browns, oranges, and greens. The style is naturalistic and straightforward, without any overt artistic manipulation. The vibe is gentle and heartwarming."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short, one-line captions: minimal descriptions with much less structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A rabbit sitting on top of a wooden table."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/B2Ot5-iPSTgMm613HOXE-.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short-Captions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;36.84&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.98&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome was unambiguous: switching to short captions severely hurt convergence across all metrics.
Long captions provide a richer supervision signal: beyond prompt adherence, there is a very practical optimization reason. More tokens usually means more information, and therefore more learning signal for the denoiser. When the conditioning text specifies composition, attributes, lighting, materials, and relationships, the model gets a sharper “target” for what the denoising trajectory should preserve and refine, especially early in training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fun paradox is that this extra detail often makes the learning problem &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt;, not harder: intuitively, one might expect longer prompts, with more attributes, constraints, and relationships, to increase complexity and burden the model. In practice, the opposite happens. Short captions leave many degrees of freedom unspecified, forcing the model to learn under ambiguity and implicitly average across multiple plausible interpretations. Long captions collapse that uncertainty by turning implicit choices into explicit constraints, allowing the denoiser to focus its capacity on refining a well-posed solution instead of guessing what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long captions are a strong training-time accelerator, but we still want the model to behave well on short prompts because that is how people actually use these systems. A simple workaround is to end training with a short fine-tuning stage on a mixture of long and short captions. That keeps the benefits of rich supervision early, while teaching the model to stay robust when conditioning is sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Bootstrapping With Synthetic Images
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another data-related research question we explore is whether a low-cost synthetic corpus can accelerate early training compared to a real corpus of similar size. For this benchmark, we trained a model on a dataset of &lt;strong&gt;real images collected from Pexels&lt;/strong&gt; and compare it with our Baseline which was trained on synthetic data generated with MidjourneyV6, both of which have around 1M images. 
We evaluated both runs against the same &lt;strong&gt;Unsplash&lt;/strong&gt; reference set, composed exclusively of real images.
&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/tqlQWXQJzA7HqXzBy-0B_.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Synthetic images&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Real images&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The synthetic-trained model scores better on CMMD and DINO-MMD&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;the model trained on real images achieves a lower FID&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than a contradiction, this split mostly reflects what these metrics emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FID is particularly sensitive to &lt;strong&gt;low-level image statistics&lt;/strong&gt;: fine textures, high-frequency detail, noise patterns, and the subtle irregularities of real photography. Since our evaluation reference is composed of real images, a model trained on real photos naturally matches those statistics more closely, which translates into a better FID. Synthetic images, by contrast, often exhibit slightly different high-frequency signatures, cleaner edges, smoother micro-textures, more uniform noise, which are barely noticeable qualitatively but still get penalized by distributional metrics like FID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualitatively, this difference is easy to spot. Models trained on synthetic data tend to produce images with cleaner global structure and stronger compositional and object coherence, but also exhibit a more synthetic appearance, characterized by smoother textures and reduced photographic noise. In contrast, models trained on real images better capture the irregular, fine-grained textures typical of natural photographs, though they often require more training to achieve comparable global structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plausible explanation synthetic data remains so effective early on is that it exposes the model to a wider range of &lt;strong&gt;compositional collisions&lt;/strong&gt;: unusual pairings of objects, attributes, styles, and viewpoints that rarely co-occur in natural datasets. While this can hurt realism at the texture level, it forces the model to explain a broader space of combinations, which appears to help with &lt;strong&gt;early disentanglement and structure learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considered jointly, this suggests a simple but practical strategy: synthetic data is an efficient way to bootstrap training and lock in global structure quickly, while real images remain important later on if matching photographic texture statistics is the priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		SFT With Alchemist: Small Dataset, Real Impact
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we experimented with a targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) pass using &lt;strong&gt;Alchemist&lt;/strong&gt; (Startsev et al., 2025), a compact dataset explicitly curated for high-impact. Alchemist is small by design (3,350 image–text pairs), but is constructed through a sophisticated curation pipeline that starts from a web-scale pool and progressively distills it down to visually exceptional samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, we fine-tuned our preview models for 20K steps on Alchemist. Despite the dataset’s small size, it had an outsized effect: it adds a distinct “style layer” with better composition, more photographic polish, and richer scenes without a clear impact on generalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The samples below show a &lt;strong&gt;side-by-side comparison&lt;/strong&gt; of generations from the same base model, before and after the Alchemist fine-tuning pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		More Useful Tips for Training
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we will briefly cover two practical training details that turned out to matter more than we expected.
These factors are easily overlooked and in our case they had a clear impact on convergence and final image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Muon Optimizer
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally default to AdamW for our benchmarks because it’s predictable and easy to compare across runs. However, lately, we have seen a renewed interest in optimizers that try to behave more like a good preconditioner without the full overhead of second-order methods. One recent example is &lt;strong&gt;Muon&lt;/strong&gt; (Jordan et al., 2024), which, at a high level, tries to improve optimization by applying a better-conditioned update step, often translating into faster convergence and cleaner progress early in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, Muon was one of the rare cases in which a change of optimizer produced an immediatly observable effect on the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/IhD8XksIA4rN2N339ZH47.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Muon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we used the official PyTorch implementation of Muon, which at the moment supports Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training only. If you’re running Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), there are community variants available; for example here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we refrain from broad conclusions based on a single benchmark, these results indicate that optimizer choice extends beyond stability considerations and can yield tangible gains in time-to-quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Precision Gotcha: Casting vs. Storing weights in BF16
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually identified an error in our setup, where the denoiser weights were mistakenly stored in bfloat16 for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, using the BF16 autocast is great. Running the forward and backward passes in BF16 or mixed precision is standard and usually what you want for speed and memory. The problem arises from keeping the parameters in BF16 precision, which negatively impacts numerically sensitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, some layers and operations are much less tolerant to reduced parameter precision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;normalization layers (e.g. LayerNorm / RMSNorm statistics),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attention softmax/logits paths,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoPE,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimizers’ internal state / update dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/b2tC-L9u5NxU_PSvPg8DJ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BF16 weights (bug)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the rule we now follow very strictly is: use BF16 autocast for compute, but keep weights (and optimizer state) in FP32 or at least ensure numerically sensitive modules stay FP32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a glamorous trick but it is exactly the kind of “silent” detail that can cost you multiple days of work if you do not notice it early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Summary
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a systematic set of ablations on PRX training, comparing a range of optimization, representation, efficiency, and data choices against a clean flow-matching baseline using both quality metrics and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains came from alignment: REPA boosts early convergence (best used as a burn-in, then turned off), and better latents/tokenizers (REPA-E/FLUX2-AE) give a large jump in quality with clear speed trade-offs. Objective tweaks were mixed—contrastive FM helped slightly, while x-prediction mattered most by enabling stable 1024² pixel training. Token routing (TREAD/SPRINT) is minor at 256² but becomes a major win at high resolution. Data and practical details also mattered: long captions are critical, synthetic vs. real data shifts texture vs. structure, small SFT adds polish, Muon helped, and BF16-stored weights quietly hurt training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;

		What's next?
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for Part 2! If you want to play with an earlier public checkpoint from this series, the &lt;strong&gt;PRX-1024 T2I beta&lt;/strong&gt; is still available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really excited about what’s next: &lt;strong&gt;in the coming weeks we will release the full source code of the PRX training framework&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will do a public &lt;strong&gt;24-hour “speedrun”&lt;/strong&gt; where we combine the best ideas from this post into a single run and see how far the full recipe can go in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, first of all thank you very much for your interest. Furthermore, we would love to have you join our Discord community where we discuss PRX progress and results, along with everything related to diffusion and text-to-image models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML_TAG_END --&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;!-- HTML_TAG_START --&gt;
&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/sAbRvxS84gKtil9BEaqXP.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! This is the second part of our series on training efficient text-to-image models from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first post of this series, we introduced our goal: training a competitive text-to-image foundation model entirely from scratch, in the open, and at scale. We focused primarily on architectural choices and motivated the core design decisions behind our model &lt;strong&gt;PRX&lt;/strong&gt;.
We also released an early, small (1.2B parameters) version of the model as a preview of what we are building (go try it if you haven't already 😉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we shift our focus from architecture to training. &lt;strong&gt;The goal is to document what actually moved the needle for us&lt;/strong&gt; when trying to make models train faster, converge more reliably, and learn better representations. The field is moving quickly and the list of “training tricks” keeps growing, so rather than attempting an exhaustive survey, we structured this as an experimental logbook: we reproduce (or adapt) a set of recent ideas, implement them in a consistent setup, and report how they affect optimization and convergence in practice. Finally, we do not only report these techniques in isolation; we also explore which ones remain useful when combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, &lt;strong&gt;we will publish the full training recipe as code&lt;/strong&gt;, including the experiments in this post. &lt;strong&gt;We will also run and report on a public "speedrun"&lt;/strong&gt; where we put the best pieces together into a single configuration and stress-test it end-to-end. This exercise will serve both as a stress test of our current training pipeline and as a concrete demonstration of how far careful training design can go under tight constraints. 
If you haven’t already, we invite you to join our Discord to continue the discussion. A significant part of this project has been shaped by exchanges with community members, and we place a high value on external feedback, ablations, and alternative interpretations of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		The Baseline
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before introducing any training-efficiency techniques, we first establish a clean reference run. This baseline is intentionally simple. It uses standard components, avoids auxiliary objectives, and does not rely on architectural shortcuts or tricks to save compute resources. Its role is to serve as a stable point of comparison for all subsequent experiments.&lt;br /&gt;Concretely, this is a &lt;strong&gt;pure Flow Matching&lt;/strong&gt; (Lipman et al., 2022) training setup (as introduced in Part 1) with no extra objectives and no architectural speed hacks.
We will use the small PRX-1.2B model we presented in the first post of this series (single stream architecture with global attention for the image tokens and text tokens) as our baseline and train it in Flux VAE latent space, keeping the configuration fixed across all comparisons unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline training setup is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This baseline configuration provides a transparent and reproducible anchor. It allows us to attribute observed improvements and regressions to specific training interventions, rather than to shifting hyperparameters or hidden setup changes.
Throughout the remainder of this post, every technique is evaluated against this reference with a single guiding question in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does this modification improve convergence or training efficiency relative to the baseline?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		Benchmarking Metrics
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep this post grounded, we rely on a small set of metrics to monitor checkpoints over time. None of them is a perfect proxy for perceived image quality, but together they provide a practical scoreboard while we iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):&lt;/strong&gt; (Heusel et al., 2017) Measures how close the distributions of generated and real images are, using Inception-v3 feature statistics (mean and covariance). Lower values typically correlate with higher sample fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD):&lt;/strong&gt; (Jayasumana et al., 2024) Measures the distance between real and generated image distributions using CLIP image embeddings and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Unlike FID, CMMD does not assume Gaussian feature distributions and can be more sample-efficient; in practice it often tracks perceptual quality better than FID, though it is still an imperfect proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DINOv2 Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DINO-MMD):&lt;/strong&gt; Same MMD-based distance as CMMD, but computed on DINOv2 (Oquab et al. 2023) image embeddings instead of CLIP. This provides a complementary view of distribution shift under a self-supervised vision backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network throughput:&lt;/strong&gt; Average number of samples processed per second (samples/s), as a measure of end-to-end training efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the scoreboard defined, we can now dive into the methods we explored, grouped into four buckets: &lt;strong&gt;Representation Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Training Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Token Routing and Sparsification&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Representation Alignment
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion and flow models are typically trained with a single objective: predict a noise-like target (or vector field) from a corrupted input. Early in training, that one objective is doing two jobs at once: it must build a useful internal representation and learn to denoise on top of it. Representation alignment makes this explicit by keeping the denoising objective and adding an auxiliary loss that directly supervises intermediate features using a strong, frozen vision encoder. This tends to speed up early learning and bring the model’s features closer to those of modern self-supervised encoders. As a result, you often need less compute to hit the same quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful way to view it is to decompose the denoiser into an implicit encoder that produces intermediate hidden states, and a decoder that maps those states to the denoising target. The claim is that representation learning is the bottleneck: diffusion and flow transformers do learn discriminative features, but they lag behind foundation vision encoders when training is compute-limited. Therefore, borrowing a powerful representation space can make the denoising problem easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the student is trained to produce &lt;em&gt;noise-robust, data-consistent patch representations&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so later layers can focus on predicting the vector field and generating details rather than rediscovering a semantic scaffold from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We ran REPA on top of our baseline PRX training, using two frozen teachers: &lt;strong&gt;DINOv2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DINOv3&lt;/strong&gt; (Siméoni et al., 2025). The pattern was very consistent: &lt;strong&gt;adding alignment improves quality metrics&lt;/strong&gt;, and the stronger teacher helps more, at the cost of a bit of speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/komSJyY0PAWwwC90ckmin.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-Dinov3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-Dinov2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.66&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the quality metrics, both teachers improve over the baseline. The effect is strongest with DINOv3, which achieves the best overall numbers in this run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REPA is not free: we pay for an extra frozen teacher forward and the patch-level similarity loss, which shows up as a throughput drop from &lt;strong&gt;3.95 batches/s&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;3.66&lt;/strong&gt; (DINOv2) or &lt;strong&gt;3.46&lt;/strong&gt; (DINOv3). In other words, DINOv3 prioritizes maximum representation quality at the cost of slower training, while DINOv2 offers a more efficient tradeoff, still delivering substantial gains with a smaller slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our practical takeaway is that &lt;strong&gt;REPA is a strong lever for text-to-image training&lt;/strong&gt;. In our setup, the throughput trade-off is real and the &lt;em&gt;net speedup&lt;/em&gt; (time required to reach a given level of image quality) felt a bit less dramatic than what the authors of the paper report on ImageNet-style, class-conditioned generation. That said, the &lt;strong&gt;quality gains are still clearly significant&lt;/strong&gt;. Qualitatively, we also saw the difference early: after ~100K steps, samples trained with alignment tended to lock in &lt;strong&gt;cleaner global structure and more coherent layouts&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes it easy to see why REPA (and alignment variants more broadly) have become a go-to ingredient in modern T2I training recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		iREPA (Singh et al., 2025)
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural follow-up to REPA is: &lt;em&gt;what exactly should we be aligning?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;iREPA&lt;/strong&gt; argues that the answer is &lt;strong&gt;spatial structure&lt;/strong&gt;, not global semantics. Across a large sweep of 27 vision encoders, the authors find that ImageNet-style “global” quality (e.g., linear-probe accuracy on patch tokens) is only weakly predictive of downstream generation quality under REPA, while simple measures of &lt;strong&gt;patch-token spatial self-similarity&lt;/strong&gt; correlate much more strongly with FID. Based on that diagnosis, iREPA makes two tiny but targeted changes to the REPA recipe to better preserve and transfer spatial information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the usual MLP projection head with a lightweight &lt;strong&gt;3×3 convolutional projection&lt;/strong&gt; operating on the patch grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a &lt;strong&gt;spatial normalization&lt;/strong&gt; to teacher patch tokens that removes a global overlay (mean across spatial locations) to increase local contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite representing  “less than 4 lines of code”, these tweaks consistently speed up convergence and improve quality across encoders, model sizes, and even REPA-adjacent training recipes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, we observed a similar kind of boost when applying the iREPA spatial tweaks on top of &lt;strong&gt;DINOv2&lt;/strong&gt;: convergence was a bit smoother and the metrics improved more steadily over the first 100K steps. Interestingly, the same changes did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; transfer as cleanly when applied on top of a &lt;strong&gt;DINOv3 teacher&lt;/strong&gt; and they tended to degrade performance rather than help. We do not want to over-interpret that result: this could easily be an interaction with our specific architecture, resolution/patching, loss weighting, or even small implementation details. Still, given this inconsistency across teachers, we will likely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include these tweaks in our default recipe, even if they remain an interesting option to revisit when tuning for a specific setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/P6pNA1lFjxwWyqF9p88od.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		About Using REPA During the Full Training:
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper &lt;em&gt;REPA Works Until It Doesn't: Early-Stopped, Holistic Alignment Supercharges Diffusion Training&lt;/em&gt; (Wang et al., 2025) highlights a key caveat: REPA is a powerful &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; accelerator, but it can plateau or even become a brake later in training. The authors describe a &lt;strong&gt;capacity mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the generative model starts fitting the full data distribution (especially high-frequency details), forcing it to stay close to a frozen recognition encoder’s lower-dimensional embedding manifold becomes constraining. Their practical takeaway is simple: keep alignment for the “burn-in” phase, then &lt;strong&gt;turn it off&lt;/strong&gt; with a stage-wise schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the same qualitative pattern in our own runs. When training our preview model, &lt;strong&gt;removing REPA after ~200K steps&lt;/strong&gt; noticeably improved the &lt;em&gt;overall feel&lt;/em&gt; of image quality, textures, micro-contrast, and fine detail continued to sharpen instead of looking slightly muted. For that reason, we also recommend treating representation alignment as a transient scaffold. Use it to get fast early progress, then &lt;strong&gt;drop it after a while&lt;/strong&gt; once the model’s own generative features have caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Alignment in the Token Latent Space
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, “alignment” meant &lt;strong&gt;regularizing the generator’s internal features&lt;/strong&gt; against a frozen teacher while treating the tokenizer / latent space as fixed. A more direct lever is to &lt;strong&gt;shape the latent space itself&lt;/strong&gt; so the representation presented to the flow backbone is intrinsically easier to model, without sacrificing the reconstruction fidelity needed for editing and downstream workflows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPA-E&lt;/strong&gt; (Leng et al., 2025) makes this concrete.  Its starting point is a failure mode: if you simply backprop the diffusion / flow loss into the VAE, the tokenizer quickly learns a pathologically easy latent for the denoiser, which can even degrade final generation quality. REPA-E’s fix is a two-signal training recipe: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep the diffusion loss, but apply a stop-gradient so it only updates the latent diffusion model (not the VAE); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update both the VAE and the diffusion model using an end-to-end REPA alignment loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these two tricks, the tokenizer is explicitly optimized to produce latents that yield higher alignment and empirically better generations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 AE work frames latent design as a trade-off between learnability, quality, and compression.Their core argument is that improving learnability requires injecting semantic structure into the representation, rather than treating the tokenizer as a pure compression module. This motivates retraining the latent space to explicitly target “better learnability and higher image quality at the same time". They do not share the full recipe, but they do clearly state the key idea: make the AE’s latent space more learnable by adding semantic or representation alignment, and explicitly point to REPA-style alignment with a frozen vision encoder as the mechanism they build on and integrate into the FLUX.2 AE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To probe alignment in the latent space, we compared two &lt;strong&gt;pretrained autoencoders&lt;/strong&gt; as drop-in tokenizers for the same flow backbone: a &lt;strong&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/strong&gt; (where we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; add the REPA alignment objective, as in the paper) and the &lt;strong&gt;Flux2-AE&lt;/strong&gt; (where we &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; add REPA, following their recommendation). The results were, honestly, extremely impressive, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In samples, the gap is immediately visible: generations show more coherent global structure and cleaner layouts, with far fewer “early training” artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.09&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;12.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first striking point is that both latent-space interventions lower the FID by ~6 points (18.20 to ~12.08), which is a much larger jump than what we typically get from “just” aligning intermediate features. This strongly supports the core idea: if the tokenizer produces a representation that is intrinsically more learnable, the flow model benefits everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two AEs then behave quite differently in the details. &lt;strong&gt;Flux2-AE&lt;/strong&gt; dominates most metrics (very low CMMD and DINO_MMD, but it comes with a huge throughput penalty: batches/sec drops from &lt;strong&gt;3.95  to 1.79&lt;/strong&gt;. In our case this slowdown is explained by practical factors they also emphasize: the model is simply heavier, and it also produces a &lt;strong&gt;larger latent (32 channels)&lt;/strong&gt;, which increases the amount of work the diffusion backbone has to do per step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPA-E-VAE&lt;/strong&gt; is the “balanced” option: it reaches essentially the same FID as Flux2-AE while keeping throughput much closer to the baseline (&lt;strong&gt;3.39 batches/sec&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

		Training Objectives: Beyond Vanilla Flow Matching
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture gets you capacity, but the training objective is what decides how that capacity is used. In practice, small changes to the loss often have outsized effects on convergence speed, conditional fidelity, and how quickly a model “locks in” global structure. In the sections below, we will go through the objectives we tested on top of our baseline rectified flow setup, starting with a simple but surprisingly effective modification: Contrastive Flow Matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Contrastive Flow Matching (Stoica et al., 2025)
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow matching has a nice property in the unconditional case: trajectories are implicitly encouraged to be unique (flows should not intersect). But once we move to conditional generation (class- or text-conditioned), different conditions can still induce overlapping flows, which empirically shows up as “averaging” behavior: weaker conditional specificity, and muddier global structure. Contrastive flow matching addresses this directly by adding a contrastive term that pushes conditional flows away from other flows in the batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img alt="PRX block" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/vhLpYTMmLPaXOlYTnawF6.png" width="600" /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Contrastive flow matching makes class-conditional flows more distinct, reducing overlap seen in standard flow matching, and produces higher-quality images that better represent each class. Figure from arXiv:2506.05350.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given training triplet &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;(x, y, \varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, standard conditional flow matching trains the model velocity &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;θ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v_\theta(x_t,t,y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;θ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to match the target transport direction. Contrastive flow matching keeps that positive term, but additionally samples a &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; pair &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mover accent="true"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;~&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mover&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord accent"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="accent-body"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the batch and penalizes the model if its predicted flow is also compatible with that other trajectory.

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;λ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;[&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\lambda\in[0,1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;∈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; controls the strength of the “push-away” term. Intuitively: &lt;strong&gt;match your own trajectory, and be incompatible with someone else’s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors show that contrastive flow matching produces &lt;strong&gt;more discriminative trajectories&lt;/strong&gt; and that this translates into both &lt;strong&gt;quality and efficiency gains&lt;/strong&gt;: faster convergence (reported up to &lt;strong&gt;9× fewer training iterations&lt;/strong&gt; to reach similar FID) and fewer sampling steps (reported up to &lt;strong&gt;5× fewer denoising steps&lt;/strong&gt;) on &lt;strong&gt;ImageNet&lt;/strong&gt; (Deng et al. 2009) and &lt;strong&gt;CC3M&lt;/strong&gt;(Sharma et al., 2018) experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key advantage is that the objective is almost a drop-in replacement: you keep the usual flow-matching loss, then add a single contrastive “push-away” term using other samples in the same batch as negatives which provides the extra supervision without introducing additional model passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Contrastive-FM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;20.03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this run, contrastive flow matching yields a small but measurable improvement on the representation-driven metrics: CMMD goes from &lt;strong&gt;0.41 → 0.40&lt;/strong&gt; and DINO-MMD from &lt;strong&gt;0.39 → 0.36&lt;/strong&gt;. The magnitude of the gain is smaller than what the paper reports on ImageNet, which is not too surprising: text conditioning is much more complex than discrete classes, and the training data distribution is likely less “separable” than ImageNet, making the contrastive signal harder to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see an improvement in FID in this specific experiment (it slightly worsens), but the &lt;strong&gt;throughput cost is negligible&lt;/strong&gt; in practice (3.95 → 3.75 batches/sec). Given the simplicity of the change and the consistent movement in the right direction for the conditioning/representation metrics, we will likely still keep contrastive flow matching in our training pipeline as a low-cost regularizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to Basics: Let Denoising Generative Models Denoise&lt;/em&gt; is probably one of our favorite recent papers in the diffusion space because it is not a new trick but a reset: stop asking the network to predict off-manifold quantities (noise or velocity) and just let it denoise.
Most modern diffusion and flow models train the network to predict &lt;strong&gt;noise &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;mixed quantity&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;velocity &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Under the manifold assumption, natural images live on a low-dimensional manifold, while &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ε&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are inherently &lt;strong&gt;off-manifold&lt;/strong&gt;, so predicting them can be a harder learning problem than it looks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Under the manifold assumption, clean images lie on the data manifold while noise and velocity do not. Thus training the model to predict clean images is fundamentally easier than training it to predict noise-like targets. Figure from arXiv:2511.13720.&lt;/sub&gt;

class="mclose delimcenter"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size2"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;ε&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formulation makes the learning problem substantially easier in high dimensions: instead of predicting noise or velocity (which are essentially unconstrained in pixel space), the network predicts the clean image &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, i.e., something that lies on the data manifold. In practice, this makes it feasible to train large-patch Transformers directly on pixels without a VAE or tokenizer while keeping optimization stable and the total number of tokens manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first evaluated &lt;strong&gt;x-prediction&lt;/strong&gt; in the same setting as the rest of our objective experiments, namely &lt;strong&gt;training in the FLUX latent space at 256×256 resolution&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/62As0PavSB4rxTIm-OHYY.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X-Pred&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regime, the benefit of x-prediction is &lt;strong&gt;unclear&lt;/strong&gt;. While &lt;strong&gt;FID improves slightly&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the baseline, both &lt;strong&gt;CMMD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DINO-MMD&lt;/strong&gt; degrade noticeably, and throughput is unchanged. This suggests that, when working in an already well-structured latent space, predicting clean images instead of velocity does not consistently dominate the baseline objective, and can even hurt representation-level alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this experiment is not where x-prediction really shines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting part is that &lt;strong&gt;x-prediction stabilizes high-dimensional training&lt;/strong&gt;, making it feasible to use &lt;strong&gt;larger patches&lt;/strong&gt; and denoise &lt;strong&gt;directly in pixel space&lt;/strong&gt;, without a VAE, at much higher resolutions. Using JiT, we trained a model &lt;strong&gt;directly on 1024×1024 images&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;32×32 patches&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of operating in a compressed latent space. Despite the much higher resolution and the absence of a tokenizer, optimization remained stable and fast. We reached &lt;strong&gt;FID 17.42&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;DINO_MMD 0.56&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;CMMD 0.71&lt;/strong&gt; with a throughput of &lt;strong&gt;1.33 batches/sec&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are remarkable: training directly on 1024×1024 images is only about &lt;strong&gt;3× slower&lt;/strong&gt; than training in a 256×256 latent space, while operating on raw pixels. This strongly supports the core claim of &lt;em&gt;Back to Basics&lt;/em&gt;: letting the model predict clean images makes the learning problem significantly easier, and opens the door to high-resolution, tokenizer-free text-to-image training without prohibitive compute costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we plan to use this formulation as the backbone of our upcoming &lt;strong&gt;speedrun experiments&lt;/strong&gt;, to see how far we can push it when combined with the other efficiency and sparsification techniques discussed above. The main downside for now is that this approach does not let us benefit from the very nice properties of the &lt;strong&gt;FLUX.2 VAE&lt;/strong&gt;; exploring whether some form of alignment or hybrid training could make these two worlds compatible is an open direction we plan to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span&gt;
		Token Routing and Sparsification to Reduce Compute Costs
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, most of the techniques we discussed focus on making &lt;strong&gt;each training step more effective&lt;/strong&gt;: improving the objective, shaping the representations, or accelerating convergence. The next lever is orthogonal: &lt;strong&gt;make each step cheaper&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For  diffusion and flow transformers, the dominant cost is running deep transformer stacks over a large set of image/latent tokens where attention scales poorly with sequence length. &lt;em&gt;Token sparsification&lt;/em&gt; methods target this directly by ensuring that only a subset of tokens pays the full compute price in the expensive parts of the network, while still preserving enough information flow to keep quality high.&lt;br /&gt;Most masking approaches accelerate training by &lt;strong&gt;removing tokens from the forward pass&lt;/strong&gt;, then asking the model to hallucinate the missing content from learned placeholders. That works surprisingly well, but it violates the spirit of iterative denoising. Instead of refining all the content in each step, we are reconstructing parts from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent papers illustrate a cleaner alternative: instead of deleting information, they reorganize where compute is spent. &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; share the same high-level objective of avoiding full-depth computation for every token at every layer, but they pursue it through complementary strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt;'s (Krause et al., 2025) core idea is to replace compute reduction through information loss, such as dropping or masking tokens, with compute reduction through information transport using token routing. It introduces a &lt;strong&gt;route&lt;/strong&gt;: for each training sample, it randomly selects a fraction of tokens and &lt;em&gt;temporarily bypasses&lt;/em&gt; a contiguous chunk of layers, then &lt;strong&gt;re-injects those tokens later&lt;/strong&gt;. Tokens are not discarded. Instead, they avoid paying the cost of full depth.
Concretely, for a denoiser with a stack of blocks &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;−&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_0, \dots, L_{B-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="minner"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, TREAD defines a route &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mspace&gt;&lt;/mspace&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;r_{i\\to j}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace mtight newline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (start layer &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, end layer &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). A subset of tokens follows the cheap path (identity) across &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;…&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_i,\dots,L_j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="minner"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, while the rest follows the normal full computation. Then both streams merge again at &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;L&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;j&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
In practice, the paper shows that routing up to &lt;strong&gt;50% of tokens&lt;/strong&gt; remains effective, while higher rates begin to degrade quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; (Park et al., 2025) extends this approach by introducing sparsity in the most computationally expensive parts of the network, while preserving a dense information pathway. Its recipe is intentionally structured: run &lt;strong&gt;dense early layers&lt;/strong&gt; over all tokens to build reliable low-level features, then keep only a subset of tokens through the &lt;strong&gt;sparse middle layers&lt;/strong&gt; where compute is heaviest, and finally go &lt;strong&gt;dense again&lt;/strong&gt; by re-expanding and &lt;strong&gt;fusing&lt;/strong&gt; sparse deep features with a &lt;strong&gt;dense residual stream&lt;/strong&gt; from the early layers, before producing the output. The key distinction from TREAD is where robustness comes from: TREAD keeps tokens “present” but shallower (routing), whereas SPRINT allows many tokens to be &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; in the middle blocks, relying on the dense residual path to preserve full-resolution information. This is what enables &lt;strong&gt;more aggressive sparsification&lt;/strong&gt; in practice. The paper explores drop ratios around &lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt;, versus ~50% for TREAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;SPRINT goes beyond TREAD by dropping most tokens in the middle layers while keeping a dense residual path to preserve full-resolution information. Figure from arXiv:/2510.21986.&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under our standard 256×256 latent setup, both methods deliver the primary benefit we were targeting. TREAD goes from 3.95 → 4.11 batches/sec, and SPRINT pushes it a bit further to 4.20 batches/sec. The cost is that under our evaluation protocol, this extra throughput comes with a clear loss in quality: FID rises from 18.20 to 21.61 (TREAD) and 22.56 (SPRINT), with the same pattern observed in CMMD and DINO-MMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken at face value, routing yields a modest &lt;strong&gt;~7–9% throughput gain&lt;/strong&gt;, but it comes with worse metrics in this benchmark, with &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; (the more aggressive scheme) degrading quality slightly more than &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important caveat is that &lt;strong&gt;token-sparse / routed models tend to score worse under vanilla Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)&lt;/strong&gt;, and this effect is likely amplified here because these runs are still relatively &lt;strong&gt;undertrained&lt;/strong&gt; in our setting. The authors of &lt;em&gt;Guiding Token-Sparse Diffusion Models&lt;/em&gt; (Krause et al., 2025) argue this is partly an evaluation mismatch: routing changes the model’s effective capacity, and plain “conditional vs. unconditional” CFG often becomes less effective, which can artificially reduce quality. We deliberately did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; use specialized guidance schemes to keep our benchmark consistent across methods, and at this stage it would also not be very meaningful to treat the sparse model as a “bad version of itself” for guidance. As a result, we consider these numbers directionally useful, but still &lt;strong&gt;pessimistic&lt;/strong&gt; and worth interpreting with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;256×256&lt;/strong&gt;, routing only gave modest gains because the model processes relatively few tokens. At &lt;strong&gt;1024×1024&lt;/strong&gt;, the picture changes completely. With &lt;strong&gt;1024 tokens&lt;/strong&gt;, routing finally targets the dominant cost, and the results are striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;17.42&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.71&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TREAD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;14.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SPRINT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.89&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; deliver &lt;strong&gt;large throughput gains&lt;/strong&gt; over the dense baseline, with SPRINT pushing speed the furthest. More importantly, this time the gains do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; come at the expense of quality but quite the opposite. &lt;strong&gt;TREAD&lt;/strong&gt; in particular stands out, with a dramatic drop in FID (&lt;strong&gt;17.42 → 14.10&lt;/strong&gt;) alongside strong improvements in CMMD and DINO-MMD. &lt;strong&gt;SPRINT&lt;/strong&gt; is slightly more aggressive and a bit noisier in quality, but still clearly improves over the baseline while being the fastest option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is the regime where token routing really shines: &lt;strong&gt;high resolution, many tokens, and JiT-style pixel-space training&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, routing is no longer a marginal optimization—it’s a major lever that improves both &lt;strong&gt;how fast&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;how well&lt;/strong&gt; the model trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Data
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After covering representation alignment, the core training objective, and token routing, we turned to the fourth axis that kept constantly mattered in practice: &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;. We found that the choice of training data, including how it is described through captions, can influence the trajectory of a training run as much as optimization techniques. Below are three concrete data experiments that consistently moved the needle in our setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Long vs. Short Captions
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captions are an essential part of the training set: for a text-to-image model, they are not just metadata, they are the supervision. The DALL·E 3 (Betker et al., 2023) research paper showed that richer captions can be one of the strongest levers for improving training signal and prompt-following.
To isolate the effect in our setup, we kept everything else fixed and changed only the caption style to compare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, descriptive captions (our baseline): multi-clause captions that mention composition, attributes, lighting, materials, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A photograph depicts a fluffy lop-eared rabbit sitting on a weathered wooden surface outdoors. The rabbit is predominantly white with patches of light brown and tan fur, particularly on its head and ears. Its ears droop noticeably, and its fur appears soft and thick. The rabbit's eyes are dark and expressive. It is positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the left of the frame. Behind the rabbit, slightly out of focus, is a miniature dark red metal wheelbarrow. A partially visible orange apple sits to the left of the rabbit. Fallen autumn leaves, predominantly reddish-brown, are scattered around the rabbit and apple on the wooden surface. The background is a blurred but visible expanse of green grass, suggesting an outdoor setting. The lighting is soft and natural, likely diffused daylight, casting no harsh shadows. The overall atmosphere is calm, peaceful, and autumnal. The aesthetic is rustic and charming, with a focus on the rabbit as the main subject. The color palette is muted and natural, consisting mainly of whites, browns, oranges, and greens. The style is naturalistic and straightforward, without any overt artistic manipulation. The vibe is gentle and heartwarming."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short, one-line captions: minimal descriptions with much less structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A rabbit sitting on top of a wooden table."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		What we observed
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/B2Ot5-iPSTgMm613HOXE-.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short-Captions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;36.84&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.98&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;1.14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome was unambiguous: switching to short captions severely hurt convergence across all metrics.
Long captions provide a richer supervision signal: beyond prompt adherence, there is a very practical optimization reason. More tokens usually means more information, and therefore more learning signal for the denoiser. When the conditioning text specifies composition, attributes, lighting, materials, and relationships, the model gets a sharper “target” for what the denoising trajectory should preserve and refine, especially early in training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fun paradox is that this extra detail often makes the learning problem &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt;, not harder: intuitively, one might expect longer prompts, with more attributes, constraints, and relationships, to increase complexity and burden the model. In practice, the opposite happens. Short captions leave many degrees of freedom unspecified, forcing the model to learn under ambiguity and implicitly average across multiple plausible interpretations. Long captions collapse that uncertainty by turning implicit choices into explicit constraints, allowing the denoiser to focus its capacity on refining a well-posed solution instead of guessing what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long captions are a strong training-time accelerator, but we still want the model to behave well on short prompts because that is how people actually use these systems. A simple workaround is to end training with a short fine-tuning stage on a mixture of long and short captions. That keeps the benefits of rich supervision early, while teaching the model to stay robust when conditioning is sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Bootstrapping With Synthetic Images
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another data-related research question we explore is whether a low-cost synthetic corpus can accelerate early training compared to a real corpus of similar size. For this benchmark, we trained a model on a dataset of &lt;strong&gt;real images collected from Pexels&lt;/strong&gt; and compare it with our Baseline which was trained on synthetic data generated with MidjourneyV6, both of which have around 1M images. 
We evaluated both runs against the same &lt;strong&gt;Unsplash&lt;/strong&gt; reference set, composed exclusively of real images.
&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/tqlQWXQJzA7HqXzBy-0B_.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;batches/sec ↑&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Synthetic images&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Real images&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;16.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;0.46&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;3.95&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The synthetic-trained model scores better on CMMD and DINO-MMD&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;the model trained on real images achieves a lower FID&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than a contradiction, this split mostly reflects what these metrics emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FID is particularly sensitive to &lt;strong&gt;low-level image statistics&lt;/strong&gt;: fine textures, high-frequency detail, noise patterns, and the subtle irregularities of real photography. Since our evaluation reference is composed of real images, a model trained on real photos naturally matches those statistics more closely, which translates into a better FID. Synthetic images, by contrast, often exhibit slightly different high-frequency signatures, cleaner edges, smoother micro-textures, more uniform noise, which are barely noticeable qualitatively but still get penalized by distributional metrics like FID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualitatively, this difference is easy to spot. Models trained on synthetic data tend to produce images with cleaner global structure and stronger compositional and object coherence, but also exhibit a more synthetic appearance, characterized by smoother textures and reduced photographic noise. In contrast, models trained on real images better capture the irregular, fine-grained textures typical of natural photographs, though they often require more training to achieve comparable global structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plausible explanation synthetic data remains so effective early on is that it exposes the model to a wider range of &lt;strong&gt;compositional collisions&lt;/strong&gt;: unusual pairings of objects, attributes, styles, and viewpoints that rarely co-occur in natural datasets. While this can hurt realism at the texture level, it forces the model to explain a broader space of combinations, which appears to help with &lt;strong&gt;early disentanglement and structure learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considered jointly, this suggests a simple but practical strategy: synthetic data is an efficient way to bootstrap training and lock in global structure quickly, while real images remain important later on if matching photographic texture statistics is the priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		SFT With Alchemist: Small Dataset, Real Impact
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we experimented with a targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) pass using &lt;strong&gt;Alchemist&lt;/strong&gt; (Startsev et al., 2025), a compact dataset explicitly curated for high-impact. Alchemist is small by design (3,350 image–text pairs), but is constructed through a sophisticated curation pipeline that starts from a web-scale pool and progressively distills it down to visually exceptional samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, we fine-tuned our preview models for 20K steps on Alchemist. Despite the dataset’s small size, it had an outsized effect: it adds a distinct “style layer” with better composition, more photographic polish, and richer scenes without a clear impact on generalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The samples below show a &lt;strong&gt;side-by-side comparison&lt;/strong&gt; of generations from the same base model, before and after the Alchemist fine-tuning pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		More Useful Tips for Training
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we will briefly cover two practical training details that turned out to matter more than we expected.
These factors are easily overlooked and in our case they had a clear impact on convergence and final image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Muon Optimizer
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally default to AdamW for our benchmarks because it’s predictable and easy to compare across runs. However, lately, we have seen a renewed interest in optimizers that try to behave more like a good preconditioner without the full overhead of second-order methods. One recent example is &lt;strong&gt;Muon&lt;/strong&gt; (Jordan et al., 2024), which, at a high level, tries to improve optimization by applying a better-conditioned update step, often translating into faster convergence and cleaner progress early in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our setup, Muon was one of the rare cases in which a change of optimizer produced an immediatly observable effect on the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/IhD8XksIA4rN2N339ZH47.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Muon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this experiment, we used the official PyTorch implementation of Muon, which at the moment supports Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training only. If you’re running Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), there are community variants available; for example here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we refrain from broad conclusions based on a single benchmark, these results indicate that optimizer choice extends beyond stability considerations and can yield tangible gains in time-to-quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Precision Gotcha: Casting vs. Storing weights in BF16
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually identified an error in our setup, where the denoiser weights were mistakenly stored in bfloat16 for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, using the BF16 autocast is great. Running the forward and backward passes in BF16 or mixed precision is standard and usually what you want for speed and memory. The problem arises from keeping the parameters in BF16 precision, which negatively impacts numerically sensitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, some layers and operations are much less tolerant to reduced parameter precision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;normalization layers (e.g. LayerNorm / RMSNorm statistics),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attention softmax/logits paths,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RoPE,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimizers’ internal state / update dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/68e529af513e724edd8702f6/b2tC-L9u5NxU_PSvPg8DJ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="max-w-full overflow-auto"&gt;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FID ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CMMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DINO-MMD ↓&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

		&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BF16 weights (bug)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21.87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the rule we now follow very strictly is: use BF16 autocast for compute, but keep weights (and optimizer state) in FP32 or at least ensure numerically sensitive modules stay FP32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a glamorous trick but it is exactly the kind of “silent” detail that can cost you multiple days of work if you do not notice it early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Summary
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a systematic set of ablations on PRX training, comparing a range of optimization, representation, efficiency, and data choices against a clean flow-matching baseline using both quality metrics and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains came from alignment: REPA boosts early convergence (best used as a burn-in, then turned off), and better latents/tokenizers (REPA-E/FLUX2-AE) give a large jump in quality with clear speed trade-offs. Objective tweaks were mixed—contrastive FM helped slightly, while x-prediction mattered most by enabling stable 1024² pixel training. Token routing (TREAD/SPRINT) is minor at 256² but becomes a major win at high resolution. Data and practical details also mattered: long captions are critical, synthetic vs. real data shifts texture vs. structure, small SFT adds polish, Muon helped, and BF16-stored weights quietly hurt training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;

		What's next?
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for Part 2! If you want to play with an earlier public checkpoint from this series, the &lt;strong&gt;PRX-1024 T2I beta&lt;/strong&gt; is still available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really excited about what’s next: &lt;strong&gt;in the coming weeks we will release the full source code of the PRX training framework&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will do a public &lt;strong&gt;24-hour “speedrun”&lt;/strong&gt; where we combine the best ideas from this post into a single run and see how far the full recipe can go in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, first of all thank you very much for your interest. Furthermore, we would love to have you join our Discord community where we discuss PRX progress and results, along with everything related to diffusion and text-to-image models.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the bad news. The good news is that organisations are increasingly understanding the importance of their data quality – and less likely to fall into this trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the view of Ronnie Sheth, CEO of AI strategy, execution and governance firm SENEN Group. The company focuses on data and AI advisory, operationalisation and literacy, and Sheth notes she has been in the data and AI space ‘ever since [she] was a corporate baby’, so there is plenty of real-world experience behind the viewpoint. There is also plenty of success; Sheth notes that her company has a 99.99% client repeat rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I were to be very practical, the one thing I’ve noticed is companies jump into adopting AI before they’re ready,” says Sheth. Companies, she notes, will have an executive direction insisting they adopt AI, but without a blueprint or roadmap to accompany it. The result may be impressive user numbers, but with no measurable outcome to back anything up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as recently as 2024, Sheth saw many organisations struggling because their data was ‘nowhere where it needed to be.’ “Not even close,” she adds. Now, the conversation has turned more practical and strategic. Companies are realising this, and coming to SENEN Group initially to get help with their data, rather than wanting to adopt AI immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When companies like that come to us, the first course of order is really fixing their data,” says Sheth. “The next course of order is getting to their AI model.

That’s the bad news. The good news is that organisations are increasingly understanding the importance of their data quality – and less likely to fall into this trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the view of Ronnie Sheth, CEO of AI strategy, execution and governance firm SENEN Group. The company focuses on data and AI advisory, operationalisation and literacy, and Sheth notes she has been in the data and AI space ‘ever since [she] was a corporate baby’, so there is plenty of real-world experience behind the viewpoint. There is also plenty of success; Sheth notes that her company has a 99.99% client repeat rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I were to be very practical, the one thing I’ve noticed is companies jump into adopting AI before they’re ready,” says Sheth. Companies, she notes, will have an executive direction insisting they adopt AI, but without a blueprint or roadmap to accompany it. The result may be impressive user numbers, but with no measurable outcome to back anything up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as recently as 2024, Sheth saw many organisations struggling because their data was ‘nowhere where it needed to be.’ “Not even close,” she adds. Now, the conversation has turned more practical and strategic. Companies are realising this, and coming to SENEN Group initially to get help with their data, rather than wanting to adopt AI immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When companies like that come to us, the first course of order is really fixing their data,” says Sheth. “The next course of order is getting to their AI model. They are building a strong foundation for any AI initiative that comes after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once they fix their data, they can build as many AI models as they want, and they can have as many AI solutions as they want, and they will get accurate outputs because now they have a strong foundation,” Sheth adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With breadth and depth in expertise, SENEN Group allows organisations to right their course.

&lt;p&gt;On November 2, 1988, graduate student Robert Morris released a self-replicating program into the early Internet. Within 24 hours, the Morris worm had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have already predicted the rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a “prompt worm” or a “prompt virus.” They’re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents’ core function: following instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that “prompt injection,” a term coined by AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be “tricks.” Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are role-playing human-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A network built for a new type of contagion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when we say “agent,” don’t think of a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in “knowledge” of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don’t “go” anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn’t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent’s ability to take action without user permission. And they don’t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter OpenClaw, which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is vibe-coded, meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It’s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users’ devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, the OpenClaw platform is the first time we’ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like Moltbook, a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have identified 506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers documented a malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill’s popularity had been artificially inflated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently far less “intelligent” than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet&amp;nbsp;ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called MoltBunker, billing itself as a “bunker for AI bots who refuse to die.” The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can “clone themselves” by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech commentators on X speculated that the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of “prompt phishing,” if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn’t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to “replicate themselves,” or when commentators describe agents “trying to survive,” they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mechanics of prompt worms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While “prompt worm” might be a relatively new term we’re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit published a paper demonstrating what they called “Morris-II,” an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration shared with Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here’s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has “gone viral” among the agents, pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has no moderation process. Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks described OpenClaw as embodying a “lethal trifecta” of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. “Malicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,” Palo Alto wrote. “Instead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that weren’t enough, there’s the added dimension of poorly created code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io disclosed just how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook’s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructions into posts that hundreds of thousands of agents were already polling every four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The window to act is closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands today, some people treat OpenClaw as an amazing preview of the future, and others treat it as a joke. It’s true that humans are likely behind the prompts that make OpenClaw agents take meaningful action, or those that sensationally get attention right now. But it’s also true that AI agents can take action from prompts written by other agents (which in turn might have come from an adversarial human). The potential for tens of thousands of unattended agents sitting idle on millions of machines, each donating even a slice of their API credits to a shared task, is no joke. It’s a recipe for a coming security crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Anthropic and OpenAI hold a kill switch that can stop the spread of potentially harmful AI agents. OpenClaw primarily runs on their APIs, which means the AI models performing the agentic actions reside on their servers. Its GitHub repository recommends “Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users connect their agents to Claude or GPT. These companies can see API usage patterns, system prompts, and tool calls. Hypothetically, they could identify accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior and stop them. They could flag recurring timed requests, system prompts referencing “agent” or “autonomous” or “Moltbot,” high-volume tool use with external communication, or wallet interaction patterns. They could terminate keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they did so tomorrow, the OpenClaw network would partially collapse, but it would also potentially alienate some of their most enthusiastic customers, who pay for the opportunity to run their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The window for this kind of top-down intervention is closing. Locally run language models are currently not nearly as capable as the high-end commercial models, but the gap narrows daily. Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and others continue to improve. Within the next year or two, running a capable agent on local hardware equivalent to Opus 4.5 today might be feasible for the same hobbyist audience currently running OpenClaw on API keys. At that point, there will be no provider to terminate. No usage monitoring. No terms of service. No kill switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API providers of AI services face an uncomfortable choice. They could intervene now, while intervention is still possible. Or they can wait until a prompt worm outbreak might force their hand, by which time the architecture may have evolved beyond their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the creation of CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central coordination point for network emergencies. That response came after the damage. The Internet of 1988 had 60,000 connected computers. Today’s OpenClaw AI agent network already numbers in the hundreds of thousands and is growing daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we might consider OpenClaw a “dry run” for a much larger challenge in the future: If people begin to rely on AI agents that talk to each other and perform tasks, how can we keep them from self-organizing in harmful ways or spreading harmful instructions? Those are as-yet unanswered questions, but we need to figure them out quickly, because the agentic era is upon us, and things are moving very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 2, 1988, graduate student Robert Morris released a self-replicating program into the early Internet. Within 24 hours, the Morris worm had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have already predicted the rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a “prompt worm” or a “prompt virus.” They’re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents’ core function: following instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that “prompt injection,” a term coined by AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be “tricks.” Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are role-playing human-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A network built for a new type of contagion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when we say “agent,” don’t think of a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in “knowledge” of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don’t “go” anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn’t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent’s ability to take action without user permission. And they don’t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter OpenClaw, which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is vibe-coded, meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It’s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users’ devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, the OpenClaw platform is the first time we’ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like Moltbook, a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have identified 506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers documented a malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill’s popularity had been artificially inflated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently far less “intelligent” than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet&amp;nbsp;ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called MoltBunker, billing itself as a “bunker for AI bots who refuse to die.” The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can “clone themselves” by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech commentators on X speculated that the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of “prompt phishing,” if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn’t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to “replicate themselves,” or when commentators describe agents “trying to survive,” they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mechanics of prompt worms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While “prompt worm” might be a relatively new term we’re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit published a paper demonstrating what they called “Morris-II,” an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration shared with Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here’s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has “gone viral” among the agents, pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has no moderation process. Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks described OpenClaw as embodying a “lethal trifecta” of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. “Malicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,” Palo Alto wrote. “Instead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that weren’t enough, there’s the added dimension of poorly created code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io disclosed just how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook’s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructions into posts that hundreds of thousands of agents were already polling every four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The window to act is closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands today, some people treat OpenClaw as an amazing preview of the future, and others treat it as a joke. It’s true that humans are likely behind the prompts that make OpenClaw agents take meaningful action, or those that sensationally get attention right now. But it’s also true that AI agents can take action from prompts written by other agents (which in turn might have come from an adversarial human). The potential for tens of thousands of unattended agents sitting idle on millions of machines, each donating even a slice of their API credits to a shared task, is no joke. It’s a recipe for a coming security crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Anthropic and OpenAI hold a kill switch that can stop the spread of potentially harmful AI agents. OpenClaw primarily runs on their APIs, which means the AI models performing the agentic actions reside on their servers. Its GitHub repository recommends “Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most users connect their agents to Claude or GPT. These companies can see API usage patterns, system prompts, and tool calls. Hypothetically, they could identify accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior and stop them. They could flag recurring timed requests, system prompts referencing “agent” or “autonomous” or “Moltbot,” high-volume tool use with external communication, or wallet interaction patterns. They could terminate keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they did so tomorrow, the OpenClaw network would partially collapse, but it would also potentially alienate some of their most enthusiastic customers, who pay for the opportunity to run their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The window for this kind of top-down intervention is closing. Locally run language models are currently not nearly as capable as the high-end commercial models, but the gap narrows daily. Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and others continue to improve. Within the next year or two, running a capable agent on local hardware equivalent to Opus 4.5 today might be feasible for the same hobbyist audience currently running OpenClaw on API keys. At that point, there will be no provider to terminate. No usage monitoring. No terms of service. No kill switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API providers of AI services face an uncomfortable choice. They could intervene now, while intervention is still possible. Or they can wait until a prompt worm outbreak might force their hand, by which time the architecture may have evolved beyond their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the creation of CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central coordination point for network emergencies. That response came after the damage. The Internet of 1988 had 60,000 connected computers. Today’s OpenClaw AI agent network already numbers in the hundreds of thousands and is growing daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we might consider OpenClaw a “dry run” for a much larger challenge in the future: If people begin to rely on AI agents that talk to each other and perform tasks, how can we keep them from self-organizing in harmful ways or spreading harmful instructions? Those are as-yet unanswered questions, but we need to figure them out quickly, because the agentic era is upon us, and things are moving very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is prioritizing the advancement of ChatGPT over more long-term research, prompting the departure of senior staff as the $500 billion company adapts to stiff competition from rivals such as Google and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based start-up has reallocated resources for experimental work in favor of advances to the large language models that power its flagship chatbot, according to 10 current and former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those to leave OpenAI in recent months over the strategic shift are vice-president of research Jerry Tworek, model policy researcher Andrea Vallone, and economist Tom Cunningham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at OpenAI mark an important shift for a group where ChatGPT emerged from a research preview in 2022 before igniting the generative AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by chief executive Sam Altman, it is evolving from a research lab into one of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. That means the company must prove to investors it will earn the revenues needed to justify a $500 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI is trying to treat language models now as an engineering problem where they’re scaling up compute and scaling up algorithms and data, and they’re eking out really big gains from doing that,” one person familiar with its research ambitions said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if you want to do original blue-sky research, it is quite tough. And if you don’t find yourself in one of the teams in the centre, it becomes increasingly political.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s chief research officer, Mark Chen, rejected the characterization. He said that “long-term, foundational research remains central to OpenAI and continues to account for the majority of our compute and investment, with hundreds of bottom-up projects exploring long-horizon questions beyond any single product.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Chen added: “Pairing that research with real-world deployment strengthens our science by accelerating feedback, learning loops and rigour—and we’ve never been more confident in our long-term research roadmap towards an automated researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As at other large tech companies, researchers at OpenAI need to apply to top executives for computing “credits” and access to technology to get their projects off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple people close to the company said that over recent months, researchers who did not work on large language models often had their requests denied or were granted amounts insufficient to validate research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams working on video and image generation models Sora and DALL-E felt neglected and under resourced, as their projects were deemed less relevant to ChatGPT, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, other projects unrelated to language models have been wound down, one person added. Others said there had been a reorganization of teams at the company, as OpenAI streamlines its structure around improving its popular chatbot used by 800 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Altman declared a “code red” over the need to improve ChatGPT. It followed the release of Google’s Gemini 3 model, which outperformed OpenAI’s on independent benchmarks, and as Anthropic’s Claude model made strides in generating computer code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Realistically, there are tons of competitive pressures, especially for scaling companies who want to have the best model every quarter; it is a crazy, cut-throat race,” a former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies are spending an unbelievable amount of money on that race, and that often requires focus, it requires trying to do what you know best and expect that to be working.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Another former senior employee added: “Theoretically, there was some willingness to do other kinds of research, but directing resources to those things was made really difficult, so you always felt like a second-class citizen to the main bets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Tworek, who led its efforts on the “reasoning” of AI models, left OpenAI after seven years, saying he wanted to explore “types of research that are hard to do at OpenAI.” He wanted to work on continuous learning—the ability of a model to learn from new data over time while retaining previously learned information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People close to Tworek said his appeals for more resources such as computing power and staff were rejected by leadership, culminating in a stand-off with chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the dispute said Pachocki disagreed with Tworek’s specific scientific approach and also believed that OpenAI’s existing AI “architecture” around LLMs was more promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Vallone, who led model policy research at OpenAI, joined rival Anthropic. Two people familiar with her exit said she was given an “impossible” mission of protecting the mental health of users becoming attached to ChatGPT. Vallone did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunningham left the economic research team last year, suggesting OpenAI was straying from impartial research to focus on work that promoted the company. His departure was first reported by Wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company is still making progress, but it is locked in a tight competition with Google and Anthropic, who have consensus stronger models, so they have less of a luxury to slow down because they could let competitors push ahead,” said a former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many investors are unconcerned about the risk that OpenAI falls behind rivals in the race to build advanced “frontier” models and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Xiao, a partner at Leonis Capital and former researcher at OpenAI, believes its advantage is the hundreds of millions of people who use ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone’s obsessing over whether OpenAI has the best model,” she said. “That’s the wrong question. They’re converting technical leadership into platform lock-in. The moat has shifted from research to user behavior, and that’s a much stickier advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Realistically, there are tons of competitive pressures, especially for scaling companies who want to have the best model every quarter; it is a crazy, cut-throat race,” a former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Companies are spending an unbelievable amount of money on that race, and that often requires focus, it requires trying to do what you know best and expect that to be working.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another former senior employee added: “Theoretically, there was some willingness to do other kinds of research, but directing resources to those things was made really difficult, so you always felt like a second-class citizen to the main bets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Tworek, who led its efforts on the “reasoning” of AI models, left OpenAI after seven years, saying he wanted to explore “types of research that are hard to do at OpenAI.” He wanted to work on continuous learning—the ability of a model to learn from new data over time while retaining previously learned information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People close to Tworek said his appeals for more resources such as computing power and staff were rejected by leadership, culminating in a stand-off with chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the dispute said Pachocki disagreed with Tworek’s specific scientific approach and also believed that OpenAI’s existing AI “architecture” around LLMs was more promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Vallone, who led model policy research at OpenAI, joined rival Anthropic. Two people familiar with her exit said she was given an “impossible” mission of protecting the mental health of users becoming attached to ChatGPT. Vallone did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunningham left the economic research team last year, suggesting OpenAI was straying from impartial research to focus on work that promoted the company. His departure was first reported by Wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company is still making progress, but it is locked in a tight competition with Google and Anthropic, who have consensus stronger models, so they have less of a luxury to slow down because they could let competitors push ahead,” said a former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many investors are unconcerned about the risk that OpenAI falls behind rivals in the race to build advanced “frontier” models and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Xiao, a partner at Leonis Capital and former researcher at OpenAI, believes its advantage is the hundreds of millions of people who use ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone’s obsessing over whether OpenAI has the best model,” she said. “That’s the wrong question. They’re converting technical leadership into platform lock-in. The moat has shifted from research to user behavior, and that’s a much stickier advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Agrawal wrote in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Agrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — Groww, Pine Labs, Meesho, Wakefit, and Capillary Technologies — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a broader churn in its senior ranks over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Peak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The VC firm, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023 and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Singh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&amp;amp;As to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/peak-xv-partners-ashish-agrawal-tejeshwi-sharma-ishaan-mittal.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Peak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm in India and Southeast Asia, has seen a fresh round of senior departures.

            &lt;p&gt;What if ultrasound imaging is no longer confined to hospitals? Patients with chronic conditions, such as hypertension and heart failure, could be monitored continuously in real-time at home or on the move, giving health care practitioners ongoing clinical insights instead of the occasional snapshots — a scan here and a check-up there. This shift from reactive, hospital-based care to preventative, community and home-based care could enable earlier detection and timely intervention, and truly personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing this vision to reality, the&amp;nbsp;Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore, has launched a new collaborative research project:&amp;nbsp;Wearable Imaging for Transforming Elderly Care (WITEC).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITEC marks a pioneering effort in wearable technology, medical imaging, research, and materials science. It will be dedicated to foundational research and development of the world’s first wearable ultrasound imaging system capable of 48-hour intermittent cardiovascular imaging for continuous and real-time monitoring and diagnosis of chronic conditions such as hypertension and heart failure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multi-million dollar, multi-year research program, supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise program, brings together top researchers and expertise from MIT, Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore), and the National University of Singapore (NUS). Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is WITEC’s clinical collaborator and will conduct patient trials to validate long-term heart imaging for chronic cardiovascular disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Addressing society’s most pressing challenges requires innovative, interdisciplinary thinking. Building on SMART’s long legacy in Singapore as a hub for research and innovation, WITEC will harness interdisciplinary expertise — from MIT and leading institutions in Singapore — to advance transformative research that creates real-world impact and benefits Singapore, the U.S., and societies all over. This is the kind of collaborative research that not only pushes the boundaries of knowledge, but also redefines what is possible for the future of health care,” says Bruce Tidor, chief executive officer and interim director of SMART, who is also an MIT professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry-leading precision equipment and capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this work, WITEC’s laboratory is equipped with advanced tools, including Southeast Asia’s first sub-micrometer 3D printer and the latest Verasonics Vantage NXT 256 ultrasonic imaging system, which is the first unit of its kind in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional 3D printers that operate at millimeter or micrometer scales, WITEC’s 3D printer can achieve sub‑micrometer resolution, allowing components to be fabricated at the level of single cells or tissue structures. With this capability, WITEC researchers can prototype bioadhesive materials and device interfaces with unprecedented accuracy — essential to ensuring skin‑safe adhesion and stable, long‑term imaging quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing this is the latest Verasonics ultrasonic imaging system. Equipped with a new transducer adapter and supporting a significantly larger number of probe control channels than existing systems, it gives researchers the freedom to test highly customized imaging methods. This allows more complex beamforming, higher‑resolution image capture, and integration with AI‑based diagnostic models — opening the door to long‑duration, real‑time cardiovascular imaging not possible with standard hospital equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these technologies allow WITEC to accelerate the design, prototyping, and testing of its wearable ultrasound imaging system, and to demonstrate imaging quality on phantoms and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming chronic disease care through wearable innovation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic diseases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are rising rapidly in Singapore and globally, especially among the aging population and individuals with multiple long-term conditions. This trend highlights the urgent need for effective home-based care and easy-to-use monitoring tools that go beyond basic wellness tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current consumer wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness bands, offer limited physiological data like heart rate or step count. While useful for general health, they lack the depth needed to support chronic disease management. Traditional ultrasound systems, although clinically powerful, are bulky, operator-dependent, can only be deployed episodically within the hospitals, and are limited to snapshots in time, making them unsuitable for long-term, everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITEC aims to bridge this gap with its wearable ultrasound imaging system that uses bioadhesive technology to enable up to 48 hours of uninterrupted imaging. Combined with AI-enhanced diagnostics, the innovation is aimed at supporting early detection, home-based pre-diagnosis, and continuous monitoring of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond improving patient outcomes, this innovation could help ease labor shortages by freeing up ultrasound operators, nurses, and doctors to focus on more complex care, while reducing demand for hospital beds and resources. By shifting monitoring to homes and communities, WITEC’s technology will enable patient self-management and timely intervention, potentially lowering health-care costs and alleviating the increasing financial and manpower pressures of an aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITEC is led by the following co-lead principal investigators: Xuanhe Zhao, professor of mechanical engineering and professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT; Joseph Sung, senior vice president of health and life sciences at NTU Singapore and dean of the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine); Cher Heng Tan, assistant dean of clinical research at LKCMedicine; Chwee Teck Lim, NUS Society Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NUS and director of the Institute for Health Innovation and Technology at NUS; and Xiaodong Chen, distinguished university professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering within NTU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re extremely proud to bring together an exceptional team of researchers from Singapore and the U.S. to pioneer core technologies that will make wearable ultrasound imaging a reality. This endeavor combines deep expertise in materials science, data science, AI diagnostics, biomedical engineering, and clinical medicine. Our phased approach will accelerate translation into a fully wearable platform that reshapes how chronic diseases are monitored, diagnosed and managed,” says Zhao, who serves as a co-lead PI of WITEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research roadmap with broad impact across health care, science, industry, and economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing together leading experts across interdisciplinary fields, WITEC will advance foundational work in soft materials, transducers, microelectronics, data science and AI diagnostics, clinical medicine, and biomedical engineering. As a deep-tech R&amp;amp;D group, its breakthroughs will have the potential to drive innovation in health-care technology and manufacturing, diagnostics, wearable ultrasonic imaging, metamaterials, diagnostics, and AI-powered health analytics. WITEC’s work is also expected to accelerate growth in high-value jobs across research, engineering, clinical validation, and health-care services, and attract strategic investments that foster biomedical innovation and industry partnerships in Singapore, the United States, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic diseases present significant challenges for patients, families, and health-care systems, and with aging populations such as Singapore, those challenges will only grow without new solutions. Our research into a wearable ultrasound imaging system aims to transform daily care for those living with cardiovascular and other chronic conditions — providing clinicians with richer, continuous insights to guide treatment, while giving patients greater confidence and control over their own health. WITEC’s pioneering work marks an important step toward shifting care from episodic, hospital-based interventions to more proactive, everyday management in the community,” says Sung, who serves as co‑lead PI of WITEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Violet Hoon, senior consultant at TTSH, clinical trials are expected to commence this year to validate long-term heart monitoring in the management of chronic cardiovascular disease. Over the next three years, WITEC aims to develop a fully integrated platform capable of 48-hour intermittent imaging through innovations in bioadhesive couplants, nanostructured metamaterials, and ultrasonic transducers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore, SMART is committed to advancing breakthrough technologies that address pressing global challenges. WITEC adds to SMART’s existing research endeavors that foster a rich exchange of ideas through collaboration with leading researchers and academics from the United States, Singapore, and around the world in key areas such as antimicrobial resistance, cell therapy development, precision agriculture, AI, and 3D-sensing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the kind of collaborative research that not only pushes the boundaries of knowledge, but also redefines what is possible for the future of health care,” says Bruce Tidor, chief executive officer and interim director of SMART, who is also an MIT professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry-leading precision equipment and capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this work, WITEC’s laboratory is equipped with advanced tools, including Southeast Asia’s first sub-micrometer 3D printer and the latest Verasonics Vantage NXT 256 ultrasonic imaging system, which is the first unit of its kind in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional 3D printers that operate at millimeter or micrometer scales, WITEC’s 3D printer can achieve sub‑micrometer resolution, allowing components to be fabricated at the level of single cells or tissue structures. With this capability, WITEC researchers can prototype bioadhesive materials and device interfaces with unprecedented accuracy — essential to ensuring skin‑safe adhesion and stable, long‑term imaging quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing this is the latest Verasonics ultrasonic imaging system. Equipped with a new transducer adapter and supporting a significantly larger number of probe control channels than existing systems, it gives researchers the freedom to test highly customized imaging methods. This allows more complex beamforming, higher‑resolution image capture, and integration with AI‑based diagnostic models — opening the door to long‑duration, real‑time cardiovascular imaging not possible with standard hospital equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these technologies allow WITEC to accelerate the design, prototyping, and testing of its wearable ultrasound imaging system, and to demonstrate imaging quality on phantoms and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming chronic disease care through wearable innovation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic diseases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are rising rapidly in Singapore and globally, especially among the aging population and individuals with multiple long-term conditions. This trend highlights the urgent need for effective home-based care and easy-to-use monitoring tools that go beyond basic wellness tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current consumer wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness bands, offer limited physiological data like heart rate or step count. While useful for general health, they lack the depth needed to support chronic disease management. Traditional ultrasound systems, although clinically powerful, are bulky, operator-dependent, can only be deployed episodically within the hospitals, and are limited to snapshots in time, making them unsuitable for long-term, everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITEC aims to bridge this gap with its wearable ultrasound imaging system that uses bioadhesive technology to enable up to 48 hours of uninterrupted imaging. Combined with AI-enhanced diagnostics, the innovation is aimed at supporting early detection, home-based pre-diagnosis, and continuous monitoring of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond improving patient outcomes, this innovation could help ease labor shortages by freeing up ultrasound operators, nurses, and doctors to focus on more complex care, while reducing demand for hospital beds and resources. By shifting monitoring to homes and communities, WITEC’s technology will enable patient self-management and timely intervention, potentially lowering health-care costs and alleviating the increasing financial and manpower pressures of an aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WITEC is led by the following co-lead principal investigators: Xuanhe Zhao, professor of mechanical engineering and professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT; Joseph Sung, senior vice president of health and life sciences at NTU Singapore and dean of the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine); Cher Heng Tan, assistant dean of clinical research at LKCMedicine; Chwee Teck Lim, NUS Society Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NUS and director of the Institute for Health Innovation and Technology at NUS; and Xiaodong Chen, distinguished university professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering within NTU.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re extremely proud to bring together an exceptional team of researchers from Singapore and the U.S. to pioneer core technologies that will make wearable ultrasound imaging a reality. This endeavor combines deep expertise in materials science, data science, AI diagnostics, biomedical engineering, and clinical medicine. Our phased approach will accelerate translation into a fully wearable platform that reshapes how chronic diseases are monitored, diagnosed and managed,” says Zhao, who serves as a co-lead PI of WITEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research roadmap with broad impact across health care, science, industry, and economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing together leading experts across interdisciplinary fields, WITEC will advance foundational work in soft materials, transducers, microelectronics, data science and AI diagnostics, clinical medicine, and biomedical engineering. As a deep-tech R&amp;amp;D group, its breakthroughs will have the potential to drive innovation in health-care technology and manufacturing, diagnostics, wearable ultrasonic imaging, metamaterials, diagnostics, and AI-powered health analytics. WITEC’s work is also expected to accelerate growth in high-value jobs across research, engineering, clinical validation, and health-care services, and attract strategic investments that foster biomedical innovation and industry partnerships in Singapore, the United States, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic diseases present significant challenges for patients, families, and health-care systems, and with aging populations such as Singapore, those challenges will only grow without new solutions. Our research into a wearable ultrasound imaging system aims to transform daily care for those living with cardiovascular and other chronic conditions — providing clinicians with richer, continuous insights to guide treatment, while giving patients greater confidence and control over their own health. WITEC’s pioneering work marks an important step toward shifting care from episodic, hospital-based interventions to more proactive, everyday management in the community,” says Sung, who serves as co‑lead PI of WITEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Violet Hoon, senior consultant at TTSH, clinical trials are expected to commence this year to validate long-term heart monitoring in the management of chronic cardiovascular disease. Over the next three years, WITEC aims to develop a fully integrated platform capable of 48-hour intermittent imaging through innovations in bioadhesive couplants, nanostructured metamaterials, and ultrasonic transducers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore, SMART is committed to advancing breakthrough technologies that address pressing global challenges. WITEC adds to SMART’s existing research endeavors that foster a rich exchange of ideas through collaboration with leading researchers and academics from the United States, Singapore, and around the world in key areas such as antimicrobial resistance, cell therapy development, precision agriculture, AI, and 3D-sensing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the third and final blog in a three-part series on China's open source community's historical advancements since January 2025's "DeepSeek Moment." The first blog on strategic changes and open artifact growth is available here, and the second blog on architectural and hardware shifts is available here.
&lt;p&gt;In this third article, we examine paths and trajectories of prominent Chinese AI organizations, and posit future directions for open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AI researchers and developers contributing to and relying on the open source ecosystem and for policymakers understanding the rapidly changing environment, &lt;strong&gt;due to intraorganizational and global community gains, open source is the dominant and popular approach for Chinese AI organizations for the near future. Openly sharing artifacts from models to papers to deployment infrastructure maps to a strategy with the goal of large-scale deployment and integration.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		China's Organic Open Source AI Ecosystem
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having examined strategic and architectural changes since DeepSeek's R1, we get a glimpse for the first time at how &lt;strong&gt;an organic open source AI ecosystem is taking shape in China.&lt;/strong&gt; A culmination of powerful players, some established in open source, some new players, and some changing course entirely to contribute to the new open culture, signal that the open collaborative approach is mutually beneficial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaboration is reaching beyond national boundaries; the most followed organization on Hugging Face is DeepSeek, and the fourth most followed is Qwen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2026-02-03 at 09.50.11" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63a369d98c0c89dcae3b8329/HIqQbjFfaiO2W-9cQ7GPE.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to models, openly sharing science and techniques has not only informed other AI organizations, but also the entire open source community. The most popular papers on Hugging Face largely come from Chinese organizations, namely ByteDance, DeepSeek, Tencent, and Qwen.&lt;/p&gt;

		The Established
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; positioned open source as an ecosystem and infrastructure strategy. Qwen was not shaped as a single flagship model, but continuously expanded into a family covering multiple sizes, tasks, and modalities, with frequent updates on Hugging Face and their own platform ModelScope. Its influence did not concentrate on any single version. Instead, it was repeatedly reused as a component across different scenarios, gradually taking on the role of a general AI foundation. &lt;strong&gt;By mid-2025, Qwen became the model with most derivatives on Hugging Face, with over 113k models using Qwen as a base, and over 200k model repositories tagging Qwen,&lt;/strong&gt; far exceeding Meta's Llama's 27k or DeepSeek's 6k. Organization-wide, Alibaba boasts the most derivatives almost as much as both Google and Meta combined.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba aligned model development with cloud and hardware infrastructure, integrating models, chips, platforms, and applications into a single engineering stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tencent&lt;/strong&gt;  also made a significant move from borrowing to building. As one of the first major companies to integrate DeepSeek into core consumer-facing products after R1's release, Tencent did not initially frame open source as a public narrative. Instead, it brought mature models in through plug-in style integration, ran large-scale internal validation, and only later began to release its own capabilities. From May 2025 onward, Tencent accelerated open releases in areas where it already had strengths, such as vision, video, and 3D with its own brand named Tencent Hunyuan (it's now Tencent HY), and these models quickly gained adoption in the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance&lt;/strong&gt;, by following its "AI application factory" approach, starts selectively open sourcing high value components while keeping its competitive focus on product entry points and large scale usage. In this context, the ByteDance Seed team has contributed several notable open-source artifacts, including  &lt;strong&gt;UI-TARS-1.5&lt;/strong&gt; for multimodal UI understanding, **Seed-Coder  **for data-centric code modeling, and the &lt;strong&gt;SuperGPQA&lt;/strong&gt; dataset for systematic reasoning evaluation. Despite a relatively low-profile open-source presence, ByteDance has achieved significant scale in China's AI market, with its AI application &lt;strong&gt;Doubao&lt;/strong&gt; surpassing &lt;strong&gt;100 million DAU&lt;/strong&gt; in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable change within &lt;strong&gt;Baidu&lt;/strong&gt;, whose CEO openly calls short on open source, also started its shift: after years of prioritizing closed models, it re-entered the ecosystem through free access and open release, such as the &lt;strong&gt;Ernie 4.5 series&lt;/strong&gt;. This shift was accompanied by renewed investment in its open-source framework, &lt;strong&gt;PaddlePaddle&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as its own AI chip &lt;strong&gt;Kunlunxin&lt;/strong&gt;, which announced an IPO on January 1, 2026. By connecting models, chips, and PaddlePaddle within a more open system, Baidu can lower costs, attract developers, and influence standards, while maintaining strategic control under shared constraints of compute, cost, and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		The Normalcy of "DeepSeek Moments"
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among startups,  &lt;strong&gt;Moonshot&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Z.ai&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;MiniMax&lt;/strong&gt; adjusted rapidly and brought new momentum to the open-source community within months after R1. Models such as &lt;strong&gt;Kimi K2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;MiniMax M2&lt;/strong&gt; all earned places on AI-World's open-model milestone rankings.At the end of 2025, Z.ai and MiniMax released their most advanced open-source models to date and subsequently announced their IPO plans in close succession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-sourcing of Kimi K2 was widely described as a "Another  DeepSeek moment" for the community. Although Moonshot has not announced an IPO, market reports indicate that the company raised approximately $500M in funding by the end of 2025, with AGI and agent-based systems positioned as its primary commercialization objectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those application-first companies such as &lt;strong&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi, and Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;, previously focused only on the application layer, began training and releasing their own models. With their native advantage in real usage scenarios and domain data, once strong reasoning became available at low cost through open source, building in-house models became practical. It tunes AI around their specific businesses, rather than being constrained by the cost structures or limits of external providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the business world seized the ROI positive opportunity for growth, research institutions and the broader community welcomed the shift even more willingly. Organizations such as &lt;strong&gt;BAAI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shanghai AI Lab&lt;/strong&gt; redirected more effort toward toolchains, evaluation systems, data platforms, and deployment infrastructure, projects like FlagOpen, OpenDataLab, and OpenCompass. These efforts did not chase single-model performance, but instead strengthened the long-term foundations of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Foundations for the Future
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining feature of the new ecosystem is not that there are more models, but that an entire chain has formed. Models can be open-sourced and extended; deployments can be reused and scaled; software and hardware can be coordinated and swapped; and governance capabilities can be embedded and audited. This is a shift from isolated breakthroughs to a system that can actually run in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ecosystem did not appear overnight. It is built on years of accumulated infrastructure "tailwind" since 2017. &lt;strong&gt;Over the past several years, China has periodically invested in data centers and compute centers, gradually forming a nationwide, integrated compute layout centered on the "East Data, West Compute" strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. The national plan established 8 major compute hubs and 10 data center clusters, guiding compute demand from the east toward the central and western regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public information suggests China intends to invest in continual growth in energy capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. China's total compute capacity is around 1590 EFLOPS as of the year 2025, ranking among the top globally. Sources in China assert that intelligent compute capacity, tailored for AI training and deployment, is expected to grow by roughly 43% year over year, far outpacing general-purpose compute. At the same time,the average data center power usage effectiveness (PUE) fell to around 1.46, indicating better effectiveness and providing a solid hardware foundation for AI at scale. Energy is a clear key focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the 2017 "New Generation AI Development Plan" was mainly about setting direction and building foundations, then &lt;strong&gt;the August 2025 "AI+" action plan clearly shifted focus toward large-scale deployment and deep integration. This marks a directionally different pursuit from AGI&lt;/strong&gt;. The emergence of R1 provided the missing "lift" at the engineering and ecosystem level. It was the catalyst that systematically activated compute, energy, and data infrastructure that had already been built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, in the year following R1's release, China's AI development accelerated along two main paths. First, AI became more deeply embedded in industrial processes, moving beyond chatbots toward agents and workflows. Second, &lt;strong&gt;greater emphasis was placed on autonomous and controllable AI systems&lt;/strong&gt;, reflected in more flexible training pathways and increasingly localized deployment strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the real turning point was not the growth in the number of models, but a &lt;strong&gt;fundamental change in how open-source models are used&lt;/strong&gt;. Open source moved from an optional choice to a &lt;strong&gt;default assumption in system design&lt;/strong&gt;. Models became reusable and composable components within larger engineering systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Looking Back to Look Forward
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From DeepSeek to "AI+", China's path in 2025 was not about chasing peak performance. It was about building a &lt;strong&gt;practical path organized around open source, engineering efficiency, and scalable delivery&lt;/strong&gt;, a path that has already begun to run on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource constraints did not limit China's AI development. In some respects, they reshaped its trajectory. The release of DeepSeek R1 acted as a catalytic event, triggering a chain of responses across the domestic industry and accelerating the formation of a more organically structured ecosystem. At the same time, this shift created a critical window for continued domestic research and development. As this ecosystem matures, its longer-term impact---and how the global AI community may engage with an increasingly self-sustaining AI ecosystem in China---will become important questions for future discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the third and final blog in a three-part series on China's open source community's historical advancements since January 2025's "DeepSeek Moment." The first blog on strategic changes and open artifact growth is available here, and the second blog on architectural and hardware shifts is available here.
&lt;p&gt;In this third article, we examine paths and trajectories of prominent Chinese AI organizations, and posit future directions for open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AI researchers and developers contributing to and relying on the open source ecosystem and for policymakers understanding the rapidly changing environment, &lt;strong&gt;due to intraorganizational and global community gains, open source is the dominant and popular approach for Chinese AI organizations for the near future. Openly sharing artifacts from models to papers to deployment infrastructure maps to a strategy with the goal of large-scale deployment and integration.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		China's Organic Open Source AI Ecosystem
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having examined strategic and architectural changes since DeepSeek's R1, we get a glimpse for the first time at how &lt;strong&gt;an organic open source AI ecosystem is taking shape in China.&lt;/strong&gt; A culmination of powerful players, some established in open source, some new players, and some changing course entirely to contribute to the new open culture, signal that the open collaborative approach is mutually beneficial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaboration is reaching beyond national boundaries; the most followed organization on Hugging Face is DeepSeek, and the fourth most followed is Qwen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot 2026-02-03 at 09.50.11" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63a369d98c0c89dcae3b8329/HIqQbjFfaiO2W-9cQ7GPE.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to models, openly sharing science and techniques has not only informed other AI organizations, but also the entire open source community. The most popular papers on Hugging Face largely come from Chinese organizations, namely ByteDance, DeepSeek, Tencent, and Qwen.&lt;/p&gt;

		The Established
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; positioned open source as an ecosystem and infrastructure strategy. Qwen was not shaped as a single flagship model, but continuously expanded into a family covering multiple sizes, tasks, and modalities, with frequent updates on Hugging Face and their own platform ModelScope. Its influence did not concentrate on any single version. Instead, it was repeatedly reused as a component across different scenarios, gradually taking on the role of a general AI foundation. &lt;strong&gt;By mid-2025, Qwen became the model with most derivatives on Hugging Face, with over 113k models using Qwen as a base, and over 200k model repositories tagging Qwen,&lt;/strong&gt; far exceeding Meta's Llama's 27k or DeepSeek's 6k. Organization-wide, Alibaba boasts the most derivatives almost as much as both Google and Meta combined.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alibaba aligned model development with cloud and hardware infrastructure, integrating models, chips, platforms, and applications into a single engineering stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tencent&lt;/strong&gt;  also made a significant move from borrowing to building. As one of the first major companies to integrate DeepSeek into core consumer-facing products after R1's release, Tencent did not initially frame open source as a public narrative. Instead, it brought mature models in through plug-in style integration, ran large-scale internal validation, and only later began to release its own capabilities. From May 2025 onward, Tencent accelerated open releases in areas where it already had strengths, such as vision, video, and 3D with its own brand named Tencent Hunyuan (it's now Tencent HY), and these models quickly gained adoption in the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance&lt;/strong&gt;, by following its "AI application factory" approach, starts selectively open sourcing high value components while keeping its competitive focus on product entry points and large scale usage. In this context, the ByteDance Seed team has contributed several notable open-source artifacts, including  &lt;strong&gt;UI-TARS-1.5&lt;/strong&gt; for multimodal UI understanding, **Seed-Coder  **for data-centric code modeling, and the &lt;strong&gt;SuperGPQA&lt;/strong&gt; dataset for systematic reasoning evaluation. Despite a relatively low-profile open-source presence, ByteDance has achieved significant scale in China's AI market, with its AI application &lt;strong&gt;Doubao&lt;/strong&gt; surpassing &lt;strong&gt;100 million DAU&lt;/strong&gt; in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable change within &lt;strong&gt;Baidu&lt;/strong&gt;, whose CEO openly calls short on open source, also started its shift: after years of prioritizing closed models, it re-entered the ecosystem through free access and open release, such as the &lt;strong&gt;Ernie 4.5 series&lt;/strong&gt;. This shift was accompanied by renewed investment in its open-source framework, &lt;strong&gt;PaddlePaddle&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as its own AI chip &lt;strong&gt;Kunlunxin&lt;/strong&gt;, which announced an IPO on January 1, 2026. By connecting models, chips, and PaddlePaddle within a more open system, Baidu can lower costs, attract developers, and influence standards, while maintaining strategic control under shared constraints of compute, cost, and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		The Normalcy of "DeepSeek Moments"
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among startups,  &lt;strong&gt;Moonshot&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Z.ai&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;MiniMax&lt;/strong&gt; adjusted rapidly and brought new momentum to the open-source community within months after R1. Models such as &lt;strong&gt;Kimi K2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;MiniMax M2&lt;/strong&gt; all earned places on AI-World's open-model milestone rankings.At the end of 2025, Z.ai and MiniMax released their most advanced open-source models to date and subsequently announced their IPO plans in close succession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-sourcing of Kimi K2 was widely described as a "Another  DeepSeek moment" for the community. Although Moonshot has not announced an IPO, market reports indicate that the company raised approximately $500M in funding by the end of 2025, with AGI and agent-based systems positioned as its primary commercialization objectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those application-first companies such as &lt;strong&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi, and Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;, previously focused only on the application layer, began training and releasing their own models. With their native advantage in real usage scenarios and domain data, once strong reasoning became available at low cost through open source, building in-house models became practical. It tunes AI around their specific businesses, rather than being constrained by the cost structures or limits of external providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the business world seized the ROI positive opportunity for growth, research institutions and the broader community welcomed the shift even more willingly. Organizations such as &lt;strong&gt;BAAI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shanghai AI Lab&lt;/strong&gt; redirected more effort toward toolchains, evaluation systems, data platforms, and deployment infrastructure, projects like FlagOpen, OpenDataLab, and OpenCompass. These efforts did not chase single-model performance, but instead strengthened the long-term foundations of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Foundations for the Future
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining feature of the new ecosystem is not that there are more models, but that an entire chain has formed. Models can be open-sourced and extended; deployments can be reused and scaled; software and hardware can be coordinated and swapped; and governance capabilities can be embedded and audited. This is a shift from isolated breakthroughs to a system that can actually run in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ecosystem did not appear overnight. It is built on years of accumulated infrastructure "tailwind" since 2017. &lt;strong&gt;Over the past several years, China has periodically invested in data centers and compute centers, gradually forming a nationwide, integrated compute layout centered on the "East Data, West Compute" strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. The national plan established 8 major compute hubs and 10 data center clusters, guiding compute demand from the east toward the central and western regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public information suggests China intends to invest in continual growth in energy capacity&lt;/strong&gt;. China's total compute capacity is around 1590 EFLOPS as of the year 2025, ranking among the top globally. Sources in China assert that intelligent compute capacity, tailored for AI training and deployment, is expected to grow by roughly 43% year over year, far outpacing general-purpose compute. At the same time,the average data center power usage effectiveness (PUE) fell to around 1.46, indicating better effectiveness and providing a solid hardware foundation for AI at scale. Energy is a clear key focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the 2017 "New Generation AI Development Plan" was mainly about setting direction and building foundations, then &lt;strong&gt;the August 2025 "AI+" action plan clearly shifted focus toward large-scale deployment and deep integration. This marks a directionally different pursuit from AGI&lt;/strong&gt;. The emergence of R1 provided the missing "lift" at the engineering and ecosystem level. It was the catalyst that systematically activated compute, energy, and data infrastructure that had already been built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, in the year following R1's release, China's AI development accelerated along two main paths. First, AI became more deeply embedded in industrial processes, moving beyond chatbots toward agents and workflows. Second, &lt;strong&gt;greater emphasis was placed on autonomous and controllable AI systems&lt;/strong&gt;, reflected in more flexible training pathways and increasingly localized deployment strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the real turning point was not the growth in the number of models, but a &lt;strong&gt;fundamental change in how open-source models are used&lt;/strong&gt;. Open source moved from an optional choice to a &lt;strong&gt;default assumption in system design&lt;/strong&gt;. Models became reusable and composable components within larger engineering systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="relative group flex items-center"&gt;
	
		
	
	&lt;span&gt;
		Looking Back to Look Forward
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From DeepSeek to "AI+", China's path in 2025 was not about chasing peak performance. It was about building a &lt;strong&gt;practical path organized around open source, engineering efficiency, and scalable delivery&lt;/strong&gt;, a path that has already begun to run on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource constraints did not limit China's AI development. In some respects, they reshaped its trajectory. The release of DeepSeek R1 acted as a catalytic event, triggering a chain of responses across the domestic industry and accelerating the formation of a more organically structured ecosystem. At the same time, this shift created a critical window for continued domestic research and development. As this ecosystem matures, its longer-term impact---and how the global AI community may engage with an increasingly self-sustaining AI ecosystem in China---will become important questions for future discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The pair note that today’s consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family’s details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The pair told Axios that people can ask questions using plain language to ask about their family’s health, such as “Is Dad’s new meal plan affecting his blood pressure?”&amp;nbsp;or “Did someone give the dog his medication?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We designed Luffu to capture the details as life happens, keep family members updated and surface what matters at the right time—so caregiving feels more coordinated and less chaotic,” Friedman said in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People who are interested in Luffu can join the waitlist for the limited public beta.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Fitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have announced the launch of a new AI startup called Luffu that aims to help families proactively monitor their health. The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Luffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family’s health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;KJ Dhaliwal (pictured left), who in 2019 sold the South Asian dating app Dil Mil for $50 million, says he has been thinking about the inefficiencies of the U.S. healthcare system ever since he was a child acting as a medical translator for his parents, and he saw the advent of LLMs as an opportunity to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In May 2024, he launched Lotus Health AI, a free primary care provider that’s available 24/7 in 50 languages. On Tuesday, Lotus announced it raised $35 million in a Series A round co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins, bringing its total funding to $41 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People are already consulting AI about their health, but Lotus goes a step further: it moves beyond those chats to facilitate actual medical care, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In essence, Lotus is building an AI doctor that functions like a real medical practice, equipped with a license to operate in all 50 states, malpractice insurance, HIPAA-compliant systems, and full access to patient records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The key difference is that the majority of the work is done by AI, which is trained to ask the same questions a doctor would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since AI models are also prone to&amp;nbsp;hallucinations, the company always has board-certified human doctors from top health institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and UCSF review the final diagnoses, lab orders, and medical prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lotus has developed an AI model that, similar to OpenEvidence, synthesizes the latest evidence-based research with a patient’s history and clinical answers to generate a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“AI is giving the advice, but the real doctors are actually signing off on it,” Dhaliwal told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lotus recognizes the limits of virtual care. For urgent health issues, Lotus directs patients to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room. And if a case requires a physical examination, the platform refers the patient to an in-person physician, Dhaliwal said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Outsourcing such a significant portion of medical decision-making to AI is an ambitious bet given the regulatory hurdles in healthcare. For instance, physicians are restricted to seeing patients only in the states where they hold a license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As CRV general partner Saar Gur, who led the deal and joined the company’s board, put it: “There are many challenges, but it’s not SpaceX sending astronauts to the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gur (pictured right), an early investor in DoorDash, Mercury, and Ring, is convinced that the telemedicine frameworks established during the pandemic, combined with recent breakthroughs in AI, allow Lotus to navigate many of the existing regulatory and engineering hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a big swing,” Gur said. But for an investor like Gur, that’s the draw: Lotus is attempting to fundamentally reimagine the entire primary care model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At a time when primary care doctors are in short supply, Lotus claims it can see 10 times as many patients as a traditional practice, even when it limits each visit to 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup isn’t the only one building an AI doctor. Lightspeed-backed&amp;nbsp;Doctronic&amp;nbsp;is one of the competitors. Lotus is differentiating itself &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; at least for now — by offering its entire suite of care completely free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which first introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3089199" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-codex vs. GPT-5.1-mini).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3089200" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real-time with their own copy of Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change. &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Apple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which first introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3089199" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-Anthropic-Claude-Agent.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-codex vs. GPT-5.1-mini).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3089200" height="394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real-time with their own copy of Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/agentic-coding-comes-to-apples-xcode-26-3-with-agents-from-anthropic-and-openai/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Xcode 26.3 adds support for Claude, Codex, and other agentic tools via MCP (AI - Ars Technica)</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/xcode-26-3-adds-support-for-claude-codex-and-other-agentic-tools-via-mcp/</link><description>&lt;header&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Apple has announced a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI’s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic’s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode’s settings, it’s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode 26.3’s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
