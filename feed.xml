As I sat there listening to one horror story after another, I almost felt sorry for the very polite consultants who were being paid to sit there, and who couldn’t do a thing about what they were hearing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hosted by a third-party arbiter at the behest of Los Angeles County, the gathering was a listening session in which survivors could “share their experiences with emergency alerts and evacuations” for a report on how the response to the Eaton Fire months earlier had succeeded and failed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long to see just how much failure there had been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a small fire started in the bone-dry brush of Pasadena’s Eaton Canyon early in the evening of Tuesday, January 7, 2025, the raging Santa Ana winds blew its embers into nearby Altadena, the historically Black and middle-class town just to the north. By Wednesday morning, much of it was burning. Its residents spent the night making frantic, desperate scrambles to grab whatever they could and get to safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath, many claimed that they received no warning to evacuate, saw no first responders battling the blazes, and had little interaction with official personnel. Most were simply left to fend for themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, while no place is “good” for a wildfire, Altadena was especially vulnerable. It was densely packed with 100-year-old wooden homes, many of which were decades behind on the code upgrades that would have better protected them. It was full of trees and other plants that had dried out during the rain-free winter. Few residents or officials were prepared for the seemingly remote possibility that the fires that often broke out in the mountains nearby would jump into town. As a result, resources were strained to the breaking point, and many homes simply burned freely.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So the people packed into the room that morning had a lot to be angry about. They unloaded their own personal ordeals, the traumas their community had experienced, and even catastrophes they’d heard about secondhand. Each was like a dagger to the heart, met with head-nods and “uh-huhs” from people all going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LA County left us to die because we couldn’t get alerts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m sleeping in my car because I was a renter and have no insurance coverage!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Millions of dollars in aid were raised for us, and we haven’t gotten anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developers are buying up Altadena and pricing out the Black families who made this place!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The firefighting planes were grounded on purpose by Joe Biden so he could fly around LA!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One of these things was definitely not like the others. And I knew why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Two&lt;strong&gt; trains collide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s something of a familiar cycle by now: Tragedy hits; rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories follow. Think of the deluge of “false flag” and “staged gun grab” conspiracy theories after mass shootings, or the rampant disinformation around covid-19 and the 2020 election. It’s often even more acute in the case of a natural disaster, when conspiracy theories about what “really” caused the calamity run right into culture-war-driven climate change denialism. Put together, these theories obscure real causes while elevating fake ones, with both sides battling it out on social media and TV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve studied these ideas extensively, having spent the last 10 years writing about conspiracy theories and disinformation as a journalist and researcher. I’ve covered everything from the rise of QAnon to whether Donald Trump faked his assassination attempt to the alarming rises in antisemitism, antivaccine conspiracism, and obsession with human trafficking. I’ve written three books, testified to Congress, and even written a report for the January 6th Committee. So this has been my life for quite a while.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Still, I’d never &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; it. Not until the Eaton Fire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a long time, I’d been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation &lt;em&gt;was in the room with me&lt;/em&gt;, and it was about my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My house, a cottage built in 1925, was one of those that burned back in January. Our only official notification to flee had come at 3:25 a.m., nine hours after the fires started. We grabbed what we could in 10 minutes, I locked our front door, and six hours later, it was all gone. We could have died. Eighteen Altadena residents &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; die—and all but one were in the area that was warned too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Previously in my professional life, I’d always been able to look at the survivors of a tragedy, crying on TV about how they’d lost everything, and think sympathetically but distantly, &lt;em&gt;Oh, those poor people.&lt;/em&gt; And soon enough, the conspiracy theories I was following about the incident for work would die down, and then it was no longer in my official purview—I could move on to the next disaster and whatever mess came with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;one of those poor people. The Eaton Fire had changed everything about my life. Would it change everything about my work as well? It felt as though two trains I’d managed to keep on parallel tracks had collided.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I’d been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation &lt;em&gt;was in the room with me&lt;/em&gt;, and it was about my life. And I wondered: Did I have a duty to journalism to push back on the wild thinking—or on this particular idea that Biden was responsible?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Or did I have a duty to myself and my sanity to just stay quiet?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Just true enough&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the days following the Eaton Fire, which coincided with another devastating fire in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the Biden plane storyline was just one of countless rumors, false claims, hoaxes, and accusations about what had happened and who was behind them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most were culture-war nonsense or political fodder. I also saw clearly fake AI slop (no, the Hollywood sign was not on fire) and bits of TikTok ephemera that could largely be ignored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They were from something like an alternate world, one where forest floors hadn’t been “raked” and where incompetent “DEI firefighters” let houses burn while water waited in a giant spigot that California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, refused to “turn on” because he preferred to protect an endangered fish. There were claims that the fires were set on purpose to clear land for the Olympics, or to cover up evidence of human trafficking. Rumors flew that LA had donated all its firefighting money and gear to Ukraine. Some speculated that the fires were started by undocumented immigrants (one was suspected of causing one of the fires but never charged) or “antifa” or Black Lives Matter activists—never mind that one of the most demographically Black areas in the city was wiped out.&amp;nbsp;Or, as always, it was the Jews. In this case, blame fell on a “wealthy Jewish couple” who supposedly owned most of LA’s water and wouldn’t let it go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These claims originated from the same “just asking questions” influencers who run the same playbook for every disaster. And they spread rapidly through X, a platform where breaking news had been drowned out by hysterical conspiracism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But many did have elements of truth to them, surrounded by layers of lies and accusations. A few were just true enough to be impossible to dismiss out of hand, but also not &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;true.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So, for the record: Biden did not ground firefighting aircraft in Los Angeles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to fact-checking by both &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; and Reuters, Biden flew into Los Angeles the day before the Eaton Fire broke out (which was also the same day that the Palisades Fire started, roughly 30 miles to the west), to dedicate two new national monuments. He left two days later. And while there were security measures in place, including flight restrictions over the area where he was staying, firefighting planes simply had to coordinate with air traffic controllers to cross into the closed-off space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when my sort-of neighbor brought up this particular theory that day in May, I wasn’t able to debunk it. For one thing, this was my first time hearing the rumor. But more than that, what could I say that would assuage this man’s anger? And if he wanted to blame Biden for his house burning down, was it really my place to tell him he was wrong—even if he was?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s common for survivors of a disaster to be aware of only parts of the story, struggle to understand the full picture, or fail to fully recollect what happened to them in the moment of survival. Once the trauma ebbs, we’re left looking for answers and clarity and &lt;em&gt;someone &lt;/em&gt;who knows what’s going on, because we certainly don’t have a clue. Hoaxes and misinformation stem from anger, confusion, and a lack of clear answers to rapidly evolving questions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can confirm that it was dizzying. Rumors and hoaxes were going around in my personal circles too, even if they weren’t so lurid and even if we didn’t really believe them. Bits of half-heard news circulated constantly in our group texts, WhatsApp chains, Facebook groups, and in-person gatherings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was confusion over who was responsible for the extent of the devastation, genuine anger about purported LA Fire Department budget cuts (though those had not actually happened to the extent conspiracists claimed they did), and fears that a Trump-controlled federal government would abandon California.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the homes and businesses that we heard had burned down hadn’t, and others that we heard had survived were gone. In an especially heartbreaking early bit of misinformation, a local child-care facility shared a Facebook post stating that FEMA was handing out vouchers to pay 90% of your rent for the next three years—except FEMA doesn’t hand out rent vouchers without an application process. I quietly reached out to the source, who took it down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this information vacuum, and given my work, friends started asking me questions, and answering them took energy and time I didn’t have. Honestly, the “disinformation researcher” was largely just as clueless as everyone else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the questions were harmless enough. At one point a friend texted me about a picture from Facebook of a burned Bible page that survived the fire when everything else had turned to ash. It looked too corny and convenient to be real. But I had also found a burned page of Psalms that had survived. I kept it in a ziplock bag because it seemed like the right thing to do. So I told my friend I didn’t know if it was real. I still don’t—but I also still have that ziplock somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Under attack&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As weeks passed, we began to deal with another major issue where truth and misinformation walked together: the reasonable worry that a new president who constantly belittled California would not be willing to provide relief funds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Recovery depended on FEMA to distribute grants, on the EPA to clear toxic debris, on the Small Business Administration to make loans for rebuilding or repairing homes, on the Army Corps of Engineers to remove the detritus of burned structures, and so much more. How would this square with the new “government efficiency” mandate touting the trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs to be cut from the federal budget?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody knew—including the many kind government employees who spent months in Altadena helping us recover while silently wondering if they were about to be fired.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many residents of Altadena began to have trepidation about accepting government assistance, particularly in its Black community, which already had a well-earned deep distrust of the federal government. Many Black residents felt that their needs and stories were being left behind in the recovery, and feared they would be the first to be priced out of whatever Altadena would become in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Outreach in person became critical. I happened to meet the two-star general in charge of the Army Corps’ effort at lunch one day, as he and his team tried to find outside-the-box ways to engage with exhausted and wary residents. He told me they had tried to use technology—texts, emails, clips designed to go viral—but it was too much information, all apparently delivered in the wrong way. Many of the people they needed to reach, particularly older residents, didn’t use social media, weren’t able to communicate well via text, and were easy prey for sophisticated scammers. It was also easy for the real information to get lost as we got &lt;em&gt;bombarded &lt;/em&gt;with communications, including many from hoaxers and frauds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, too, wasn’t new to me. Many of the movements I’ve covered are awash in grift and worthless wellness products. I know the signs of a scam and a snake-oil salesman. Still, I watched helplessly as my friends and my community, desperate for help, were turned into chum for cash-hungry sharks opening their jaws wide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The community was hammered by dodgy contractors and fly-by-night debris removal companies, relief scams and phony grants, and spam calls from “repair companies” and builders. We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. We were also victimized by looting: Abandoned wires on our lot were stripped for copper, and our neighbor’s unlocked garage was ransacked. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fear of being conned was easily transmittable, even to me personally. After hearing of friends who couldn’t get a FEMA grant because a previous owner of their home had fraudulently filed an application, we delayed our own appointment with FEMA for weeks. The agency’s call had come so out of the blue that we were convinced it was fake. Maybe my job made me overcautious, or maybe we were just paralyzed by the sheer tonnage of decisions and calls that needed to be handled. Whatever the reason, the fear meant we later had to make multiple calls just to get our meeting rescheduled. It’s a small thing, but when you’re as exhausted and dispirited as we were, there are no small things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127182" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eaton-fire.jpg?w=2726" width="2726" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Contractors for the US Army Corps of Engineers remove hazardous materials from a home destroyed in the Eaton Fire, near a burned-out car.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making all this even more frustrating was that the scammers, the people spinning tales of lasers and endangered fish and antifa, were very much ignoring the reality: that our planet is trying to kill us.&amp;nbsp;While federal officials recently made an arrest in the Palisades Fire, the direct causes of that fire and the nearby Eaton Fire may still take years of investigation and litigation to be fully known. But even now, it can’t be denied to any reasonable degree that climate change worsened the wind that made the fires spread more quickly. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Santa Ana winds bombarding Southern California were among the worst ever to hit the region. Their ferocity drove the embers well beyond the nominal fire danger line, particularly in Altadena. Many landed in brush left brittle and dead by the decades-long drought plaguing California. And they had even more fuel because the &lt;em&gt;previous &lt;/em&gt;two winters had been among the wettest in the region’s recent history. Such rapid swings between wet and dry or cold and hot have become so common around the world that they even have a name: climate whiplash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are the conspiracy theory gurus who see this and make money off it, peddling disinformation on their podcasts and livestreams, while blaming everyone and everything but the real reasons. Many of these figures have spent decades railing against the very idea that the climate could change. And if it is changing, they claimed, human consumption and urbanization have nothing to do with it&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;When faced with a disaster that undeniably reflected climate change at work, their business models—which rely on sales of subscriptions and merchandise—demanded that they just keep denying it was climate change at work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As more cities and countries deal with “once in a century” climate disasters, I have no doubt that these figures will continue to deflect attention away from human activity. They will use crackpot science, conspiracy theories, politics, and—increasingly—fake videos depicting whatever AI can generate. They will prey on their audiences’ limited understanding of basic science, their inability to perceive how climate and weather differ, and their fears that globalist power brokers will somehow use the weather against them. And their message will spread with little pushback from social media platforms more concerned with virality and shareholder value than truth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Resisting the temptation&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you cover disinformation and live through an event creating a massive volume of disinformation, it’s like floating outside your body on an operating table as your heart is being worked on, while also being a heart surgeon. I knew I should be trying to help. But I did not have the mental capacity, the time, or, to be honest, the interest in covering what the worst people on the internet were saying about the worst time of my life. I had very real questions about where my family would live. Thinking about my career was not a priority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course, these experiences cannot now be excised from my career. I’ve spent a lot of time talking about how trauma influences conspiracism; see how the isolation and boredom of covid created a new generation of conspiracy theory believers. And now I had my own trauma, and it has been a test of my abilities as a journalist and a thinker to avoid falling into the pit of despair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I have a much deeper understanding of the psychology at work in conspiracy belief. One of the biggest reasons conspiracy theories take off after a disaster is that they serve to make sense out of something that makes no sense. Neighborhoods aren’t &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to burn down in an era of highly trained firefighters and seemingly fireproof materials. They especially aren’t supposed to burn down in Los Angeles, one of the wealthiest cities on the planet. These were seven- and eight-figure homes going up like matches&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;There must be a reason, people figured. Someone, or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, must be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, as I emerge from the haze to something resembling “normal,” I feel more compassion and understanding for trauma victims who turn to conspiracy theories. Having faced the literal burning down of my life, I get the urge to assign meaning to such a calamity and point a finger at whoever we think did it to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the people of Altadena and Pacific Palisades continue to slowly put our lives and communities back together. The effects of both our warming planet and our disinformation crisis continue to assert themselves every day. It’s still alluring to look for easy answers in outrageous conspiracy theories, but such answers are not real and offer no actual help—only the illusion of help.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s equally tempting for someone who researches and debunks conspiracy theories to mock or belittle the people who believe these ideas. &lt;em&gt;How could anyone be so dumb as to think Joe Biden caused the fire that burned down my home?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I kept my mouth shut that day at the meeting in the church, though, again, I can now sympathize much more deeply with something I’d otherwise think completely inane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even a journalist who lost his house is still a journalist. So I decided early on that what I really needed to do was keep Altadena in the news. I went on TV and radio, blogged, and happily told our story to anyone who asked. I focused on the community, the impact, the people who would be working to recover long after the national spotlight moved to the next shiny object.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there is a professional lesson to be taken from this nightmare, it might be that the people caught up in tragedies are exactly that: caught up. And those who believe this nonsense find something of value in it. They find hope and comfort and the reassurance that whoever did this to them will get what they deserve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have done it too, throwing away years of experience to embrace conspiracist nihilism in the face of unspeakable trauma. After all, &lt;em&gt;those poor people &lt;/em&gt;going through this weren’t just on my TV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They were my friends. They were me. They could be anyone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mike Rothschild is a journalist and an expert on the growth and impact of conspiracy theories and disinformation.

As I sat there listening to one horror story after another, I almost felt sorry for the very polite consultants who were being paid to sit there, and who couldn’t do a thing about what they were hearing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hosted by a third-party arbiter at the behest of Los Angeles County, the gathering was a listening session in which survivors could “share their experiences with emergency alerts and evacuations” for a report on how the response to the Eaton Fire months earlier had succeeded and failed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long to see just how much failure there had been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After a small fire started in the bone-dry brush of Pasadena’s Eaton Canyon early in the evening of Tuesday, January 7, 2025, the raging Santa Ana winds blew its embers into nearby Altadena, the historically Black and middle-class town just to the north. By Wednesday morning, much of it was burning. Its residents spent the night making frantic, desperate scrambles to grab whatever they could and get to safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath, many claimed that they received no warning to evacuate, saw no first responders battling the blazes, and had little interaction with official personnel. Most were simply left to fend for themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, while no place is “good” for a wildfire, Altadena was especially vulnerable. It was densely packed with 100-year-old wooden homes, many of which were decades behind on the code upgrades that would have better protected them. It was full of trees and other plants that had dried out during the rain-free winter. Few residents or officials were prepared for the seemingly remote possibility that the fires that often broke out in the mountains nearby would jump into town. As a result, resources were strained to the breaking point, and many homes simply burned freely.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So the people packed into the room that morning had a lot to be angry about. They unloaded their own personal ordeals, the traumas their community had experienced, and even catastrophes they’d heard about secondhand. Each was like a dagger to the heart, met with head-nods and “uh-huhs” from people all going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LA County left us to die because we couldn’t get alerts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m sleeping in my car because I was a renter and have no insurance coverage!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Millions of dollars in aid were raised for us, and we haven’t gotten anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developers are buying up Altadena and pricing out the Black families who made this place!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The firefighting planes were grounded on purpose by Joe Biden so he could fly around LA!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;One of these things was definitely not like the others. And I knew why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Two&lt;strong&gt; trains collide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s something of a familiar cycle by now: Tragedy hits; rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories follow. Think of the deluge of “false flag” and “staged gun grab” conspiracy theories after mass shootings, or the rampant disinformation around covid-19 and the 2020 election. It’s often even more acute in the case of a natural disaster, when conspiracy theories about what “really” caused the calamity run right into culture-war-driven climate change denialism. Put together, these theories obscure real causes while elevating fake ones, with both sides battling it out on social media and TV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve studied these ideas extensively, having spent the last 10 years writing about conspiracy theories and disinformation as a journalist and researcher. I’ve covered everything from the rise of QAnon to whether Donald Trump faked his assassination attempt to the alarming rises in antisemitism, antivaccine conspiracism, and obsession with human trafficking. I’ve written three books, testified to Congress, and even written a report for the January 6th Committee. So this has been my life for quite a while.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Still, I’d never &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; it. Not until the Eaton Fire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a long time, I’d been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation &lt;em&gt;was in the room with me&lt;/em&gt;, and it was about my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My house, a cottage built in 1925, was one of those that burned back in January. Our only official notification to flee had come at 3:25 a.m., nine hours after the fires started. We grabbed what we could in 10 minutes, I locked our front door, and six hours later, it was all gone. We could have died. Eighteen Altadena residents &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; die—and all but one were in the area that was warned too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Previously in my professional life, I’d always been able to look at the survivors of a tragedy, crying on TV about how they’d lost everything, and think sympathetically but distantly, &lt;em&gt;Oh, those poor people.&lt;/em&gt; And soon enough, the conspiracy theories I was following about the incident for work would die down, and then it was no longer in my official purview—I could move on to the next disaster and whatever mess came with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;one of those poor people. The Eaton Fire had changed everything about my life. Would it change everything about my work as well? It felt as though two trains I’d managed to keep on parallel tracks had collided.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I’d been able to talk about the conspiracy theories without letting them in. Now the disinformation &lt;em&gt;was in the room with me&lt;/em&gt;, and it was about my life. And I wondered: Did I have a duty to journalism to push back on the wild thinking—or on this particular idea that Biden was responsible?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Or did I have a duty to myself and my sanity to just stay quiet?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Just true enough&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the days following the Eaton Fire, which coincided with another devastating fire in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the Biden plane storyline was just one of countless rumors, false claims, hoaxes, and accusations about what had happened and who was behind them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most were culture-war nonsense or political fodder. I also saw clearly fake AI slop (no, the Hollywood sign was not on fire) and bits of TikTok ephemera that could largely be ignored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They were from something like an alternate world, one where forest floors hadn’t been “raked” and where incompetent “DEI firefighters” let houses burn while water waited in a giant spigot that California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, refused to “turn on” because he preferred to protect an endangered fish. There were claims that the fires were set on purpose to clear land for the Olympics, or to cover up evidence of human trafficking. Rumors flew that LA had donated all its firefighting money and gear to Ukraine. Some speculated that the fires were started by undocumented immigrants (one was suspected of causing one of the fires but never charged) or “antifa” or Black Lives Matter activists—never mind that one of the most demographically Black areas in the city was wiped out.&amp;nbsp;Or, as always, it was the Jews. In this case, blame fell on a “wealthy Jewish couple” who supposedly owned most of LA’s water and wouldn’t let it go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These claims originated from the same “just asking questions” influencers who run the same playbook for every disaster. And they spread rapidly through X, a platform where breaking news had been drowned out by hysterical conspiracism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But many did have elements of truth to them, surrounded by layers of lies and accusations. A few were just true enough to be impossible to dismiss out of hand, but also not &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;true.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So, for the record: Biden did not ground firefighting aircraft in Los Angeles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to fact-checking by both &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; and Reuters, Biden flew into Los Angeles the day before the Eaton Fire broke out (which was also the same day that the Palisades Fire started, roughly 30 miles to the west), to dedicate two new national monuments. He left two days later. And while there were security measures in place, including flight restrictions over the area where he was staying, firefighting planes simply had to coordinate with air traffic controllers to cross into the closed-off space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when my sort-of neighbor brought up this particular theory that day in May, I wasn’t able to debunk it. For one thing, this was my first time hearing the rumor. But more than that, what could I say that would assuage this man’s anger? And if he wanted to blame Biden for his house burning down, was it really my place to tell him he was wrong—even if he was?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s common for survivors of a disaster to be aware of only parts of the story, struggle to understand the full picture, or fail to fully recollect what happened to them in the moment of survival. Once the trauma ebbs, we’re left looking for answers and clarity and &lt;em&gt;someone &lt;/em&gt;who knows what’s going on, because we certainly don’t have a clue. Hoaxes and misinformation stem from anger, confusion, and a lack of clear answers to rapidly evolving questions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can confirm that it was dizzying. Rumors and hoaxes were going around in my personal circles too, even if they weren’t so lurid and even if we didn’t really believe them. Bits of half-heard news circulated constantly in our group texts, WhatsApp chains, Facebook groups, and in-person gatherings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was confusion over who was responsible for the extent of the devastation, genuine anger about purported LA Fire Department budget cuts (though those had not actually happened to the extent conspiracists claimed they did), and fears that a Trump-controlled federal government would abandon California.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the homes and businesses that we heard had burned down hadn’t, and others that we heard had survived were gone. In an especially heartbreaking early bit of misinformation, a local child-care facility shared a Facebook post stating that FEMA was handing out vouchers to pay 90% of your rent for the next three years—except FEMA doesn’t hand out rent vouchers without an application process. I quietly reached out to the source, who took it down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this information vacuum, and given my work, friends started asking me questions, and answering them took energy and time I didn’t have. Honestly, the “disinformation researcher” was largely just as clueless as everyone else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the questions were harmless enough. At one point a friend texted me about a picture from Facebook of a burned Bible page that survived the fire when everything else had turned to ash. It looked too corny and convenient to be real. But I had also found a burned page of Psalms that had survived. I kept it in a ziplock bag because it seemed like the right thing to do. So I told my friend I didn’t know if it was real. I still don’t—but I also still have that ziplock somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Under attack&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As weeks passed, we began to deal with another major issue where truth and misinformation walked together: the reasonable worry that a new president who constantly belittled California would not be willing to provide relief funds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Recovery depended on FEMA to distribute grants, on the EPA to clear toxic debris, on the Small Business Administration to make loans for rebuilding or repairing homes, on the Army Corps of Engineers to remove the detritus of burned structures, and so much more. How would this square with the new “government efficiency” mandate touting the trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs to be cut from the federal budget?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody knew—including the many kind government employees who spent months in Altadena helping us recover while silently wondering if they were about to be fired.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many residents of Altadena began to have trepidation about accepting government assistance, particularly in its Black community, which already had a well-earned deep distrust of the federal government. Many Black residents felt that their needs and stories were being left behind in the recovery, and feared they would be the first to be priced out of whatever Altadena would become in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Outreach in person became critical. I happened to meet the two-star general in charge of the Army Corps’ effort at lunch one day, as he and his team tried to find outside-the-box ways to engage with exhausted and wary residents. He told me they had tried to use technology—texts, emails, clips designed to go viral—but it was too much information, all apparently delivered in the wrong way. Many of the people they needed to reach, particularly older residents, didn’t use social media, weren’t able to communicate well via text, and were easy prey for sophisticated scammers. It was also easy for the real information to get lost as we got &lt;em&gt;bombarded &lt;/em&gt;with communications, including many from hoaxers and frauds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, too, wasn’t new to me. Many of the movements I’ve covered are awash in grift and worthless wellness products. I know the signs of a scam and a snake-oil salesman. Still, I watched helplessly as my friends and my community, desperate for help, were turned into chum for cash-hungry sharks opening their jaws wide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The community was hammered by dodgy contractors and fly-by-night debris removal companies, relief scams and phony grants, and spam calls from “repair companies” and builders. We dealt with scammers, grifters, squatters, thieves, and even tow truck companies that simply stole cars parked outside burned lots and held them for ransom. We were also victimized by looting: Abandoned wires on our lot were stripped for copper, and our neighbor’s unlocked garage was ransacked. After a decade of helping people recognize scams and frauds, there was little I could do when they came for us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fear of being conned was easily transmittable, even to me personally. After hearing of friends who couldn’t get a FEMA grant because a previous owner of their home had fraudulently filed an application, we delayed our own appointment with FEMA for weeks. The agency’s call had come so out of the blue that we were convinced it was fake. Maybe my job made me overcautious, or maybe we were just paralyzed by the sheer tonnage of decisions and calls that needed to be handled. Whatever the reason, the fear meant we later had to make multiple calls just to get our meeting rescheduled. It’s a small thing, but when you’re as exhausted and dispirited as we were, there are no small things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127182" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eaton-fire.jpg?w=2726" width="2726" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Contractors for the US Army Corps of Engineers remove hazardous materials from a home destroyed in the Eaton Fire, near a burned-out car.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | GETTY IMAGES&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making all this even more frustrating was that the scammers, the people spinning tales of lasers and endangered fish and antifa, were very much ignoring the reality: that our planet is trying to kill us.&amp;nbsp;While federal officials recently made an arrest in the Palisades Fire, the direct causes of that fire and the nearby Eaton Fire may still take years of investigation and litigation to be fully known. But even now, it can’t be denied to any reasonable degree that climate change worsened the wind that made the fires spread more quickly. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Santa Ana winds bombarding Southern California were among the worst ever to hit the region. Their ferocity drove the embers well beyond the nominal fire danger line, particularly in Altadena. Many landed in brush left brittle and dead by the decades-long drought plaguing California. And they had even more fuel because the &lt;em&gt;previous &lt;/em&gt;two winters had been among the wettest in the region’s recent history. Such rapid swings between wet and dry or cold and hot have become so common around the world that they even have a name: climate whiplash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are the conspiracy theory gurus who see this and make money off it, peddling disinformation on their podcasts and livestreams, while blaming everyone and everything but the real reasons. Many of these figures have spent decades railing against the very idea that the climate could change. And if it is changing, they claimed, human consumption and urbanization have nothing to do with it&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;When faced with a disaster that undeniably reflected climate change at work, their business models—which rely on sales of subscriptions and merchandise—demanded that they just keep denying it was climate change at work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As more cities and countries deal with “once in a century” climate disasters, I have no doubt that these figures will continue to deflect attention away from human activity. They will use crackpot science, conspiracy theories, politics, and—increasingly—fake videos depicting whatever AI can generate. They will prey on their audiences’ limited understanding of basic science, their inability to perceive how climate and weather differ, and their fears that globalist power brokers will somehow use the weather against them. And their message will spread with little pushback from social media platforms more concerned with virality and shareholder value than truth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Resisting the temptation&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you cover disinformation and live through an event creating a massive volume of disinformation, it’s like floating outside your body on an operating table as your heart is being worked on, while also being a heart surgeon. I knew I should be trying to help. But I did not have the mental capacity, the time, or, to be honest, the interest in covering what the worst people on the internet were saying about the worst time of my life. I had very real questions about where my family would live. Thinking about my career was not a priority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But of course, these experiences cannot now be excised from my career. I’ve spent a lot of time talking about how trauma influences conspiracism; see how the isolation and boredom of covid created a new generation of conspiracy theory believers. And now I had my own trauma, and it has been a test of my abilities as a journalist and a thinker to avoid falling into the pit of despair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I have a much deeper understanding of the psychology at work in conspiracy belief. One of the biggest reasons conspiracy theories take off after a disaster is that they serve to make sense out of something that makes no sense. Neighborhoods aren’t &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to burn down in an era of highly trained firefighters and seemingly fireproof materials. They especially aren’t supposed to burn down in Los Angeles, one of the wealthiest cities on the planet. These were seven- and eight-figure homes going up like matches&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;There must be a reason, people figured. Someone, or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, must be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, as I emerge from the haze to something resembling “normal,” I feel more compassion and understanding for trauma victims who turn to conspiracy theories. Having faced the literal burning down of my life, I get the urge to assign meaning to such a calamity and point a finger at whoever we think did it to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the people of Altadena and Pacific Palisades continue to slowly put our lives and communities back together. The effects of both our warming planet and our disinformation crisis continue to assert themselves every day. It’s still alluring to look for easy answers in outrageous conspiracy theories, but such answers are not real and offer no actual help—only the illusion of help.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s equally tempting for someone who researches and debunks conspiracy theories to mock or belittle the people who believe these ideas. &lt;em&gt;How could anyone be so dumb as to think Joe Biden caused the fire that burned down my home?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I kept my mouth shut that day at the meeting in the church, though, again, I can now sympathize much more deeply with something I’d otherwise think completely inane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But even a journalist who lost his house is still a journalist. So I decided early on that what I really needed to do was keep Altadena in the news. I went on TV and radio, blogged, and happily told our story to anyone who asked. I focused on the community, the impact, the people who would be working to recover long after the national spotlight moved to the next shiny object.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there is a professional lesson to be taken from this nightmare, it might be that the people caught up in tragedies are exactly that: caught up. And those who believe this nonsense find something of value in it. They find hope and comfort and the reassurance that whoever did this to them will get what they deserve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have done it too, throwing away years of experience to embrace conspiracist nihilism in the face of unspeakable trauma. After all, &lt;em&gt;those poor people &lt;/em&gt;going through this weren’t just on my TV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They were my friends. They were me. They could be anyone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mike Rothschild is a journalist and an expert on the growth and impact of conspiracy theories and disinformation.

In fact, a tag proudly declares, “100% cotton made in Myanmar”—but it’s a second tag, just below that one, that makes this blue button-down so expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I looked at it and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Wow, this is cool&lt;/em&gt;,” says Brooke Hermann, the 30-year-old Kentucky-based reseller who bought the top for $1 at a secondhand sale in 2024. “This doesn’t look like any other Fruit of the Loom tag I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Quick question: Does the Fruit of the Loom logo feature a cornucopia?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of us have been wearing the casualwear company’s T-shirts and underpants for decades, and yet the question of whether there is a woven brown horn of plenty on the logo is surprisingly contentious. According to a 2022 poll by the research company YouGov, 55% of Americans believe the logo does include a cornucopia, 25% are unsure, and only 21% are confident that it doesn’t, even though this last group is correct. According to a 2023 post from the company, the Fruit of the Loom logo does not include—and, according to Snopes, has never included—a horn of plenty. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; could not reach Fruit of the Loom for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve come across this fact before, via an internet meme that made you gasp, shrug, or scratch your head. There’s a specific name for what’s happening here: Those who believe the logo used to include the cornucopia are experiencing the “Mandela effect,” or collective false memory, so called because a number of people misremember that Nelson Mandela died in prison. I helped popularize the phenomenon in a viral 2016 &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;article about a movie that doesn’t actually exist, and in the time since it’s become something of a household term; TV shows from &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; have explored the Mandela effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But whether you remember the brown horn, incorrectly recall Darth Vader saying, “Luke, I am your father,” or believe that a popular children’s book was spelled &lt;em&gt;The Berenstein Bears&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve probably moved on with your life. Google searches for “Mandela effect” have plummeted from 2016 highs, and Hermann has had zero bids on the shirt she posted last year—even though, at least to her eyes, it features a cornucopia on the tag. “No one’s really offered anything, and no one’s said anything about it,” she says, “which to me is kind of crazy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet while many find it easy to let their unconfirmable beliefs go, others have spent the better part of a decade seeking answers—and vindication. There are commonly more than 170,000 weekly visitors to a Mandela effect subreddit that sees over 1,000 comments on average every day. While a fair share of these commenters are skeptics, plenty more are dedicated believers who are not satisfied with the prevailing explanation that human memory is fallible and instead invest their time into bringing the truth—whatever exactly it may be—to light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been a bit ostracized from my family ever since I started pushing this thing nine years ago,” says a 51-year-old Massachusetts-based Fruit of the Loom truther who asked to go by the name AJ Booras. “I’m not inclined to simply let this phenomenon fall by the proverbial wayside, even if I’m the last one standing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some online believe in a fairly straightforward conspiracy: They want Fruit of the Loom to confess that it’s “gaslighting” customers and used to have a cornucopia on its tags. Others speculate that the answer lies in quantum physics: If—as the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said—there’s “better than 50-50 odds” that we’re living in a simulation, then might there be some sort of glitch, lag, or failed software update that means some people see and remember the world differently from others?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The scientific community isn’t really looking that hard at it—and if they are, they’re always framing it as a memory thing,” says AJ. “It’s a hard barrier to make any headway on.” This is why, AJ says, he’s become “addicted” to researching the phenomenon: “It’s a personal quest for vindication.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will anyone ever believe these believers? There are two options for those who think the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia: accept that your memory is wrong, or think that the world is. What makes some people happy with the simple explanation and others determined to seek the more complicated one?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“The bridge between perception and memory”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as disconcerting as when memory and reality conflict. After all, what is reality—or at least your reality—if not your memory? This is why it can be so satisfying to find concrete evidence that you are irrefutably correct: Here’s an old photo that proves Dad &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come on the ’09 trip to Florida and your sister is foolish and wrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Mandela effect community, evidence implying that the world used to be different is called “residue.” There is an abundant amount of residue suggesting that the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the 2006 animated film &lt;em&gt;The Ant Bully&lt;/em&gt;, a pair of parodical “Fruit of the Loin” underwear is drawn with a cornucopia on the tag. A similar gag in a 2012 episode of &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; sees a fake clothing brand named “Cornucopia.” In 1973, when the jazz flutist Frank Wess released an album called &lt;em&gt;Flute of the Loom&lt;/em&gt;, the cover showed fruit pouring out a cornucopia-shaped flute. When allegedly tracked down by Redditors, the illustrator reportedly said the clothing logo had inspired the design: “Why the hell else would I have used a cornucopia?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On top of that, numerous newspaper and magazine articles written from the 1970s to the early 2000s reference the horn of plenty, as does a short play first performed in 1968 and a novel, &lt;em&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1992. New residue is still being discovered: In April 2025, a TikToker shared an old ’90s trivia game in which clues about brands are listed on cards. The card for Fruit of the Loom includes the words “underwear,” “apples and grapes,” and “cornucopia.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How can all these people—animators, illustrators, journalists, and writers—have made the same mistake? When I reached out to the author of &lt;em&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/em&gt;, David James Duncan, he was adamant that there was no mistake: “My inspiration was the Fruit of the Loom boxer shorts I owned at the time,” he said via email. “I changed nothing in describing the boxers, and yes, they did have a Fruit of the Loom cornucopia on the label in the back of the shorts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Conversely, when I spoke with Billy Cox, a journalist who referenced the cornucopia in a 1994 article in &lt;em&gt;Florida Today&lt;/em&gt;, he was less confident. “I have no idea what fueled my initial assumption about the cornucopia. Zero. Zilch-o. Nada,” said Cox, also via email. But he’s prepared to admit that he may have been careless in his reporting: “Even if the internet had been available back then, I doubt I would’ve double-checked the logo’s history.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting thought: Most of the articles referencing the cornucopia are from a period—the ’70s through the ’90s—when journalists wouldn’t have been able to quickly google the logo. But why would they all misremember it &lt;em&gt;the exact same way&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wilma Bainbridge is an associate psychology professor at the University of Chicago who researches what she calls “the bridge between perception and memory”; she got her PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT in 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge herself first came across the Mandela effect on social media—she was “wowed” when confronted with the true spelling of the Berenstain Bears in the famous American children’s books. In 2022, she published a scientific study on visual Mandela effects and ultimately found that there is consistency in what people misremember. “People’s memories are surprisingly predictable,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of &amp;quot;The Berenstain Bears: Ready, Set, Go!&amp;quot; book for children" class="wp-image-1127164" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_630152518_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg?w=2100" width="2100" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ADOBE STOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127174" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250px-Stan_and_Jan_Berenstain.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;The husband-and-wife team of Stanley and Janice Berenstain wrote and illustrated the popular children’s books. More than 300 titles bear the family name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one experiment in the study, she found that people who aren’t very familiar with an image can share the same false memories as those who claim to be highly familiar. For example, some Mandela effect experiencers believe that the Monopoly man wore a monocle. In Bainbridge’s study, even people who didn’t know the character well sometimes drew the monocle when they were shown the Monopoly man and were later asked to draw him; this means the mistake was based on recall, not recognition, and could suggest that there’s something intrinsic to certain images that encourages memory errors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scientists have long demonstrated that human memory is inherently fallible. In 1996, psychologists asked people whether they had watched news footage of the 1992 Bijlmer plane crash in Amsterdam, and more than 60% of the participants said yes—even though no recording of the crash exists. Other studies have shown that our memories can be corrupted by our peers and that false memories can be contagious. Arguably, the internet has caused memory contagion when it comes to the Mandela effect: Comparatively very few people googled “Fruit of the Loom cornucopia” between 2004 and 2017, with searches growing more common after a Redditor pointed out what was believed to be the first piece of “residue” in 2016 and (and again spiking dramatically when a TikTok video on the phenomenon was posted in 2023; it’s since earned over 5 million views).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Some people make things go viral because they want to believe it,” says Don, a 61-year-old American who has been moderating the Mandela effect subreddit since 2017. (He asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy.) “People want to be part of the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Bainbridge’s study didn’t land on one definitive reason for the Mandela effect. “I was surprised to find there was no singular explanation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Using a method of monitoring cursor movement that’s analogous to eye-tracking technology, the academic tested whether people made memory errors because they didn’t pay attention to an image or looked at only certain parts of it. She found this wasn’t the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could it be, then, that people simply fill in the blanks of their memory with archetypes—we remember the Monopoly man with a monocle because we associate the eyepiece with rich old men?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge has found that this explanation—known as the “schema theory”—cannot fully explain the Mandela effect either. In one of her experiments, participants were asked to select the correct Fruit of the Loom logo from three images: one without a cornucopia, one with a cornucopia, and one with a plate. Even though we see fruit on plates far more often than we see it inside cornucopias, more participants selected the horn of plenty than the crockery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge is drawn to the idea that some images simply cause more false memories than others. “We think the underlying cause will not likely be a single feature—e.g., attractiveness, color—but how these features work together in relation to things already stored in our memory,” she says. “But this work is still in its early stages, so we don’t know exactly what that combination is like.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Believers like AJ just aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“In simulation, anything can happen”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people remember looking at this unfamiliar object on their underwear tag,” says AJ, “and asking a parent, ‘Is that a loom?’ and the parents saying, ‘No! That’s what we call a cornucopia.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When he was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, AJ wore Fruit of the Loom underwear and regularly folded laundry with his mother. “You stack up enough underwear, and you’re seeing that logo over and over and over again,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a newly fledged adult around the late ’90s, AJ had to go to the store and buy his own underwear for the first time. “I noticed,” he says, “that the logo had changed, and it was just a pile of fruit.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Unperturbed, AJ assumed the company had just rebranded—he didn’t worry about it too much until almost two decades later, when he came across the Mandela effect online and realized the consensus was that there had never been a cornucopia. “We call it the wave of 2016 in the Mandela effect community—it was this huge rush of many, many effects that were being noticed,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first time he heard about the Mandela effect, AJ says, he “actually swooned” because of an “overwhelming existential dread that something was dreadfully wrong with reality itself.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, AJ believes in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;numerous instances of the Mandela effect, all of which have been shown to be incorrect but nonetheless have robust believer communities online: that the pizza roll brand used to be called Tostino’s, not Totino’s; that the location of Australia has moved on the world map; that the show &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/em&gt;; Froot Loops cereal was formerly Fruit Loops; human organs have shifted positions; the sun changed color from yellow to white …&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For him, each is just one part of a larger problem he can’t explain about the universe. At first, AJ says, he sought answers by researching memory science and psychology, but he was left unsatisfied. So instead, he looked to quantum mechanics and metaphysics, specifically ontology—the study of reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2003, the philosopher Nick Bostrom—famous for his theories on the threat of AI “superintelligence”—posited that humanity may be living inside a simulation. Almost two decades later, the astronomer David Kipping performed some calculations and put the odds at 50-50. “In simulation, anything can happen,” AJ says. “You could have different servers—one server hasn’t been updated, some people are seeing one version, some people are seeing the other.” It is also possible, AJ argues, that we exist in a multiverse—an idea first floated by the physicist Hugh Everett III in the 1950s. If people are somehow traveling between these parallel universes, then they may have memories from different worlds. Both of these theories are recurrent in the Mandela effect community online.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet AJ doesn’t find these explanations entirely fulfilling: “If we jumped universes, why would there be residue?” Instead, he’s been diving into a combination of the theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler’s concept of the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)—which suggests, controversially, that the act of observation creates reality—and the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Eugene Wigner’s “friend” experiment, which theorized that two observers can experience two different realities. AJ believes that physicists’ own work may be affecting the universe: “It’s almost like you’re changing the parameters of reality itself by digging deeper.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is still so much that the experts themselves can’t explain about quantum physics, so it’s no wonder that laypeople get confused. The internet offers myriad rabbit holes to go down, some of them legitimate and some of them less so. Things are complicated further when YouTubers and internet commenters who aren’t well versed in the science take specific, highly complex theories and experiments and try to apply them to other phenomena, even if there is no concrete evidence they’re related. So I set about emailing physicists, simply to see whether they believe it might be remotely possible that quantum physics could, in fact, explain the Mandela effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Numerous academics replied telling me they had nothing to say on the topic; Bostrom’s office said he was unavailable. I asked the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli—who has been labelled one of the world’s 50 top thinkers—whether he has any thoughts about Mandela effect believers’ quantum-physics-related theories. “Yes, definitely,” he replied. “They are all total bullshit! There are few things about which I am totally convinced. This is one.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I contacted the University of Oxford physicist David Deutsch—often called the “father of quantum computing”—and listed the theories believers think may explain the Mandela effect, including parallel universes, simulations, the holographic principle, PAP, and Wigner’s friend idea. “Considered as explanations of the Mandela effect, none of those follow from quantum theory, and none of them constitute a rational speculation beyond it,” he said. Johns Hopkins University professor and physicist Sean M. Carroll concurs: “I cannot imagine how any of those phenomena could be in any way related to the Mandela effect.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Melvin Vopson, an associate professor of physics at the University of Portsmouth who has conducted research on the simulation theory, admits he has experienced the Mandela effect himself but doesn’t attribute the phenomenon to glitches in the simulation: That’d be a “cheap explanation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, scientists waving away these explanations could have a detrimental effect: In the absence of expert engagement, there are plenty of people online who can bolster believers’ views. AJ is not surprised by these responses: “I just don’t think that physicists have given it a real hard look,” he says, “because they’re already certain that it’s explainable otherwise.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge, for her part, thinks her study at least disproves the theory that we’ve been jumping between different universes. When she took those study participants who weren’t familiar with certain logos and mascots and showed them the correct version for the first time, she tested their memory by asking them to redraw the image only moments later, and still some drew the Mandela effect version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s unlikely we jumped dimensions during that short time span,” she says, “so it seems like the Mandela effect is something more about the shortcuts our memories take, rather than something about parallel worlds.” She hopes her future work will help further elucidate these “shortcuts,” and she is even planning to see whether she can create her own Mandela effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Leaving it all behind&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the most well-documented memory phenomena is the “misinformation effect.” Since the 1970s, scientists have demonstrated that exposing people to misinformation after an event can alter their memories. If people are asked leading questions—say, “Did you see the broken headlight?” rather than “Did you see a broken headlight?” after witnessing a crash—they are more likely to report seeing something they didn’t. But on the flip side, warning witnesses about the threat of misinformation before they recount an event can increase the accuracy of their memory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In short, the way information is presented to us is crucial. This is why it was pretty poor form for YouGov to poll Americans about the Fruit of the Loom logo with a question that was easily open to misinterpretation: “Does the logo for the clothing company Fruit of the Loom have a cornucopia of fruit in it, or not?” It is unclear here which part is in question—the cornucopia or the fruit. But it was also poor form that I didn’t mention this until now—nor did I mention that Neil deGrasse Tyson later changed his mind about simulation theory and is now “convinced” that we do not live in a simulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was also probably pretty misleading of me to start this article with a link-free reference to Brooke Hermann’s eBay-listed shirt, which she believes features a cornucopia but to my eyes clearly features brown leaves. From the ’60s to the early ’00s, the Fruit of the Loom logo did include brown leaves behind the fruit; they were recolored green in 2003. When I started writing this article, I was certain that my Fruit of the Loom childhood PE kit had a cornucopia on the tag. I’m now convinced that 10-year-old me simply wasn’t looking that closely and thus I’ve misremembered the leaves as a horn. After all, even when I look at the current logo on shirts listed on the Fruit of the Loom website, my eyes still seem to want to make this mistake: From far away, I interpret the crowded cluster as a cornucopia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns non-stacked"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="current Fruit of the Loom logo in color" class="wp-image-1127168" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fruit-Of-The-Loom.svg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fruit of the Loom line drawing for trade application from 1973" class="wp-image-1127167" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/73006089-e1761771436941.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;The current Fruit of the Loom logo (left) and the version submitted in their 1973 trademark design application. Neither contain a cornucopia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s as easy as that to convince me my memory was wrong—whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide. I’m clearly at one end of some sort of spectrum here. Other Mandela effect experiencers may believe something stranger is going on but are still prepared to happily get on with their lives. Larry Jung is a thirtysomething musician who was living in New Jersey when he spent hours hunting for Fruit of the Loom residue; in 2019, he even purchased a copy of a 1969 book for around $20 so he could see the cornucopia reference within it. “I did obsess about it for a while in the beginning,” says Jung, who remembers the cornucopia because he mistook it for a croissant as a child. “But then—I don’t know, I just came to this acceptance phase. I just didn’t want it to affect my life in a big way. I didn’t want to bring it up in every discussion.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or, as another erstwhile Mandela effect researcher puts it: “If I just so happened to be living in a computer simulation, and that was my entire reality, what can I do about that?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don, the Mandela effect subreddit moderator, has seen waves of people move on while he has stayed active in the community for the better part of a decade (I first spoke to him for my &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;article in 2016). “I’ve recruited a lot of moderators, and they come and go pretty quick,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don says he experiences “more than average but less than all” examples of the Mandela effect (he too remembers the cornucopia on his childhood underpants). “They find solutions that they find acceptable,” he says of some people who leave the sub. For others, the cognitive dissonance becomes “too much,” he adds. “It interferes with their ability to function.” Don theorizes that the people who stay are people who experienced the Mandela effect organically, “in the wild,” he says, “before it was a well-known phenomenon”—arguably the antithesis of people jumping on an internet bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I compare it to someone who saw Bigfoot. If you were in the woods and Bigfoot walks into your campground and he scares you and your kids, eight feet tall, smells terrible—you’re not going to forget it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AJ concurs that “anchor memories” like these are key. And yet Jung has a croissant-based anchor memory, and I myself have similar anecdotes about false memories I’ve found easy to let go. Psychologically, why does the Mandela effect affect people in such vastly different ways? Why do some people hold onto their memories while others don’t?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We know that most people’s intuitions about memory are wrong; they think of it as an accurate recording device when in fact memory is a reconstructive apparatus that is presenting us with recollections based on very fragmented snippets,” says Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol who writes computer simulations of memory to better understand how the mind works. “So most people will have an exaggerated sense of the accuracy of their own memories and will refuse to accept that they could be completely false.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Lewandowsky has studied misinformation and has coauthored &lt;em&gt;The Conspiracy Theory Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, and he says that while some people move on from their conspiracy theories, others turn them into their identity. “They will enter a state,” he says, “in which they are extremely difficult to extract from their rabbit hole.” People who become highly committed to conspiracies “tend to be disgruntled and feel left behind by society and are extremely distrustful,” Lewandowsky adds. “Those people also tend to be high in narcissism and often exhibit paranoid thoughts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shauna Bowes is an assistant psychology professor at the University of Alabama who researches conspiratorial ideation, misinformation, and intellectual humility. Her work has found that people with this last quality—the tendency to acknowledge the limits of your own views—are less likely to believe misinformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Belief perseverance is when you double down on your beliefs, even if evidence contradicts them,” Bowes says. “There are many reasons why some are willing to change their minds while others do not. Personality traits, childhood experiences, social networks, cognitive styles, and more determine these processes. What we do know is that people who tend to be more cognitively flexible, humble, and generally open-minded also tend to change their minds more in response to evidence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet when it comes to the Mandela effect, the question of “evidence” is a complicated one—after all, there’s plenty of cornucopia residue. Part of the trouble with understanding people’s responses to the Mandela effect is that the phenomenon can’t neatly be categorized as misinformation or conspiracy theory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lewandowsky believes the Mandela effect is primarily a social phenomenon. “My take on it is that if many people believe that an event has happened, that becomes a social norm that other people can support by sharing that belief. Social norms are very powerful,” he says, adding that the internet “provides a great amplification machine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Creating reality&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AJ tells me that even though skeptics have called him “so many derogatory names over the last nine years,” he remains passionate about spreading word of the Mandela effect. He wants to “push a dialogue” so that believers don’t feel afraid to speak out. Mostly, AJ wants scientists to look at the &lt;em&gt;qualitative&lt;/em&gt; side of things: the hundreds of autobiographical accounts by people with very specific memories of things that are now officially said not to have happened the way they recall. He wishes scientists would speak to experiencers directly, the same way the once-skeptical astronomer Josef Allen Hynek spoke to UFO eyewitnesses in the mid-20th century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Once upon a time, the UFO phenomenon was considered to be fringe. And now we have multiple world governments that have acknowledged that there is stuff flying around that we don’t know what it is,” AJ says. Overall, “the goal is to get the scientific establishment to at least consider the other side.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, AJ is not alone, even if Mandela effect believers do exist on a spectrum. The community holds space for people having fun with the phenomenon, for those committed to just a single example of the effect, for others who dive in on a short-term basis before moving on—and for those who have run the International Mandela Effect Conference in locations across the US since 2019.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there’s Don, who is still moderating the subreddit after all these years and has seen believers of every stripe. “The thing that keeps me going is I want to make sure that it’s still here,” he says. “There’s a lot of history here, and I want to keep it around for that reason.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, he believes there may be different explanations for different examples of the Mandela effect. It could be as simple as people confusing Fruit of the Loom with a knockoff brand, he says, or as complicated as Fruit of the Loom lying about the cornucopia as free advertising (though he also notes that no one has ever actually discovered an old Fruit of the Loom label with a cornucopia on it).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don also wonders whether some people might be guinea pigs caught up in longitudinal studies in which psychologists play with subjects’ memories. He’s considered, too, that nefarious tech bros could be digitally manipulating and deleting data on the internet as a form of social engineering, a possibility he compares to the Cambridge Analytica affair. “It’s something that’s possible. I’m not saying that’s what’s happening,” he says. “But this is the kind of thing that could be being done.” (To be clear: Don shared no evidence that this is being done.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Don’s most interesting belief is that the Mandela effect is not a phenomenon but an “event”—one that may now in fact be over. In his opinion, there have been no significant or “persuasive” examples discovered since 2019 (when Redditors found that the character Baloo in Disney’s 1967 &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; never wore a coconut bra). Don believes the community peaked between 2015 and 2018, when people were making new discoveries regularly. “There was a period of time where it was an actual event, like this was an ongoing event,” he says. He compares the whole thing to medieval manias in which people danced themselves to death: “I think the fervor with which the Mandela effect spread will likely be compared to dancing plagues by future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toward the end of my second of three calls with AJ, he asked me if I’d also experienced the Mandela effect. I explained that historically I experienced it with Fruit of the Loom, but I’m prepared to believe it was just a false memory. “Yeah, that’s fair,” he said. But I started to wonder if it is. When I wrote about the Mandela effect in 2016, I wanted to write an exciting story with twists and turns, which arguably played up the mystery. Am I responsible for making some people question reality? What are the consequences of writing another article, the one you’re currently reading? How much am I creating reality by observing it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be “fair” to AJ, should I tell you that one of memory science’s most famous studies has recently come under fire, and some academics now believe that people aren’t as susceptible to false memories as we once thought?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or to be “fair” to you, the reader, should I stress that despite my own desire to believe in the mysteries of the universe, I’ve come away thinking that the biggest mystery of all is the human mind?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia Tait is a London-based freelance features journalist who writes about culture, trends, and unusual phenomena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a shirt currently listed on eBay for $2,128.79. It was not designed by Versace or Dior, nor spun from the world’s finest silk. In fact, a tag proudly declares, “100% cotton made in Myanmar”—but it’s a second tag, just below that one, that makes this blue button-down so expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I looked at it and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Wow, this is cool&lt;/em&gt;,” says Brooke Hermann, the 30-year-old Kentucky-based reseller who bought the top for $1 at a secondhand sale in 2024. “This doesn’t look like any other Fruit of the Loom tag I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Quick question: Does the Fruit of the Loom logo feature a cornucopia?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of us have been wearing the casualwear company’s T-shirts and underpants for decades, and yet the question of whether there is a woven brown horn of plenty on the logo is surprisingly contentious. According to a 2022 poll by the research company YouGov, 55% of Americans believe the logo does include a cornucopia, 25% are unsure, and only 21% are confident that it doesn’t, even though this last group is correct. According to a 2023 post from the company, the Fruit of the Loom logo does not include—and, according to Snopes, has never included—a horn of plenty. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; could not reach Fruit of the Loom for comment.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve come across this fact before, via an internet meme that made you gasp, shrug, or scratch your head. There’s a specific name for what’s happening here: Those who believe the logo used to include the cornucopia are experiencing the “Mandela effect,” or collective false memory, so called because a number of people misremember that Nelson Mandela died in prison. I helped popularize the phenomenon in a viral 2016 &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;article about a movie that doesn’t actually exist, and in the time since it’s become something of a household term; TV shows from &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt; have explored the Mandela effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But whether you remember the brown horn, incorrectly recall Darth Vader saying, “Luke, I am your father,” or believe that a popular children’s book was spelled &lt;em&gt;The Berenstein Bears&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve probably moved on with your life. Google searches for “Mandela effect” have plummeted from 2016 highs, and Hermann has had zero bids on the shirt she posted last year—even though, at least to her eyes, it features a cornucopia on the tag. “No one’s really offered anything, and no one’s said anything about it,” she says, “which to me is kind of crazy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet while many find it easy to let their unconfirmable beliefs go, others have spent the better part of a decade seeking answers—and vindication. There are commonly more than 170,000 weekly visitors to a Mandela effect subreddit that sees over 1,000 comments on average every day. While a fair share of these commenters are skeptics, plenty more are dedicated believers who are not satisfied with the prevailing explanation that human memory is fallible and instead invest their time into bringing the truth—whatever exactly it may be—to light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been a bit ostracized from my family ever since I started pushing this thing nine years ago,” says a 51-year-old Massachusetts-based Fruit of the Loom truther who asked to go by the name AJ Booras. “I’m not inclined to simply let this phenomenon fall by the proverbial wayside, even if I’m the last one standing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Some online believe in a fairly straightforward conspiracy: They want Fruit of the Loom to confess that it’s “gaslighting” customers and used to have a cornucopia on its tags. Others speculate that the answer lies in quantum physics: If—as the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has said—there’s “better than 50-50 odds” that we’re living in a simulation, then might there be some sort of glitch, lag, or failed software update that means some people see and remember the world differently from others?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The scientific community isn’t really looking that hard at it—and if they are, they’re always framing it as a memory thing,” says AJ. “It’s a hard barrier to make any headway on.” This is why, AJ says, he’s become “addicted” to researching the phenomenon: “It’s a personal quest for vindication.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will anyone ever believe these believers? There are two options for those who think the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia: accept that your memory is wrong, or think that the world is. What makes some people happy with the simple explanation and others determined to seek the more complicated one?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“The bridge between perception and memory”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as disconcerting as when memory and reality conflict. After all, what is reality—or at least your reality—if not your memory? This is why it can be so satisfying to find concrete evidence that you are irrefutably correct: Here’s an old photo that proves Dad &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come on the ’09 trip to Florida and your sister is foolish and wrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Mandela effect community, evidence implying that the world used to be different is called “residue.” There is an abundant amount of residue suggesting that the Fruit of the Loom logo once had a cornucopia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the 2006 animated film &lt;em&gt;The Ant Bully&lt;/em&gt;, a pair of parodical “Fruit of the Loin” underwear is drawn with a cornucopia on the tag. A similar gag in a 2012 episode of &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; sees a fake clothing brand named “Cornucopia.” In 1973, when the jazz flutist Frank Wess released an album called &lt;em&gt;Flute of the Loom&lt;/em&gt;, the cover showed fruit pouring out a cornucopia-shaped flute. When allegedly tracked down by Redditors, the illustrator reportedly said the clothing logo had inspired the design: “Why the hell else would I have used a cornucopia?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On top of that, numerous newspaper and magazine articles written from the 1970s to the early 2000s reference the horn of plenty, as does a short play first performed in 1968 and a novel, &lt;em&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1992. New residue is still being discovered: In April 2025, a TikToker shared an old ’90s trivia game in which clues about brands are listed on cards. The card for Fruit of the Loom includes the words “underwear,” “apples and grapes,” and “cornucopia.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How can all these people—animators, illustrators, journalists, and writers—have made the same mistake? When I reached out to the author of &lt;em&gt;The Brothers K&lt;/em&gt;, David James Duncan, he was adamant that there was no mistake: “My inspiration was the Fruit of the Loom boxer shorts I owned at the time,” he said via email. “I changed nothing in describing the boxers, and yes, they did have a Fruit of the Loom cornucopia on the label in the back of the shorts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Conversely, when I spoke with Billy Cox, a journalist who referenced the cornucopia in a 1994 article in &lt;em&gt;Florida Today&lt;/em&gt;, he was less confident. “I have no idea what fueled my initial assumption about the cornucopia. Zero. Zilch-o. Nada,” said Cox, also via email. But he’s prepared to admit that he may have been careless in his reporting: “Even if the internet had been available back then, I doubt I would’ve double-checked the logo’s history.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting thought: Most of the articles referencing the cornucopia are from a period—the ’70s through the ’90s—when journalists wouldn’t have been able to quickly google the logo. But why would they all misremember it &lt;em&gt;the exact same way&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wilma Bainbridge is an associate psychology professor at the University of Chicago who researches what she calls “the bridge between perception and memory”; she got her PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT in 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge herself first came across the Mandela effect on social media—she was “wowed” when confronted with the true spelling of the Berenstain Bears in the famous American children’s books. In 2022, she published a scientific study on visual Mandela effects and ultimately found that there is consistency in what people misremember. “People’s memories are surprisingly predictable,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of &amp;quot;The Berenstain Bears: Ready, Set, Go!&amp;quot; book for children" class="wp-image-1127164" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_630152518_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg?w=2100" width="2100" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ADOBE STOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127174" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250px-Stan_and_Jan_Berenstain.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;WIKIMEDIA COMMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;The husband-and-wife team of Stanley and Janice Berenstain wrote and illustrated the popular children’s books. More than 300 titles bear the family name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one experiment in the study, she found that people who aren’t very familiar with an image can share the same false memories as those who claim to be highly familiar. For example, some Mandela effect experiencers believe that the Monopoly man wore a monocle. In Bainbridge’s study, even people who didn’t know the character well sometimes drew the monocle when they were shown the Monopoly man and were later asked to draw him; this means the mistake was based on recall, not recognition, and could suggest that there’s something intrinsic to certain images that encourages memory errors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scientists have long demonstrated that human memory is inherently fallible. In 1996, psychologists asked people whether they had watched news footage of the 1992 Bijlmer plane crash in Amsterdam, and more than 60% of the participants said yes—even though no recording of the crash exists. Other studies have shown that our memories can be corrupted by our peers and that false memories can be contagious. Arguably, the internet has caused memory contagion when it comes to the Mandela effect: Comparatively very few people googled “Fruit of the Loom cornucopia” between 2004 and 2017, with searches growing more common after a Redditor pointed out what was believed to be the first piece of “residue” in 2016 and (and again spiking dramatically when a TikTok video on the phenomenon was posted in 2023; it’s since earned over 5 million views).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Some people make things go viral because they want to believe it,” says Don, a 61-year-old American who has been moderating the Mandela effect subreddit since 2017. (He asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy.) “People want to be part of the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, Bainbridge’s study didn’t land on one definitive reason for the Mandela effect. “I was surprised to find there was no singular explanation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Using a method of monitoring cursor movement that’s analogous to eye-tracking technology, the academic tested whether people made memory errors because they didn’t pay attention to an image or looked at only certain parts of it. She found this wasn’t the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could it be, then, that people simply fill in the blanks of their memory with archetypes—we remember the Monopoly man with a monocle because we associate the eyepiece with rich old men?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge has found that this explanation—known as the “schema theory”—cannot fully explain the Mandela effect either. In one of her experiments, participants were asked to select the correct Fruit of the Loom logo from three images: one without a cornucopia, one with a cornucopia, and one with a plate. Even though we see fruit on plates far more often than we see it inside cornucopias, more participants selected the horn of plenty than the crockery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge is drawn to the idea that some images simply cause more false memories than others. “We think the underlying cause will not likely be a single feature—e.g., attractiveness, color—but how these features work together in relation to things already stored in our memory,” she says. “But this work is still in its early stages, so we don’t know exactly what that combination is like.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Believers like AJ just aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“In simulation, anything can happen”&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people remember looking at this unfamiliar object on their underwear tag,” says AJ, “and asking a parent, ‘Is that a loom?’ and the parents saying, ‘No! That’s what we call a cornucopia.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When he was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, AJ wore Fruit of the Loom underwear and regularly folded laundry with his mother. “You stack up enough underwear, and you’re seeing that logo over and over and over again,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a newly fledged adult around the late ’90s, AJ had to go to the store and buy his own underwear for the first time. “I noticed,” he says, “that the logo had changed, and it was just a pile of fruit.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Unperturbed, AJ assumed the company had just rebranded—he didn’t worry about it too much until almost two decades later, when he came across the Mandela effect online and realized the consensus was that there had never been a cornucopia. “We call it the wave of 2016 in the Mandela effect community—it was this huge rush of many, many effects that were being noticed,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first time he heard about the Mandela effect, AJ says, he “actually swooned” because of an “overwhelming existential dread that something was dreadfully wrong with reality itself.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, AJ believes in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;numerous instances of the Mandela effect, all of which have been shown to be incorrect but nonetheless have robust believer communities online: that the pizza roll brand used to be called Tostino’s, not Totino’s; that the location of Australia has moved on the world map; that the show &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/em&gt;; Froot Loops cereal was formerly Fruit Loops; human organs have shifted positions; the sun changed color from yellow to white …&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For him, each is just one part of a larger problem he can’t explain about the universe. At first, AJ says, he sought answers by researching memory science and psychology, but he was left unsatisfied. So instead, he looked to quantum mechanics and metaphysics, specifically ontology—the study of reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2003, the philosopher Nick Bostrom—famous for his theories on the threat of AI “superintelligence”—posited that humanity may be living inside a simulation. Almost two decades later, the astronomer David Kipping performed some calculations and put the odds at 50-50. “In simulation, anything can happen,” AJ says. “You could have different servers—one server hasn’t been updated, some people are seeing one version, some people are seeing the other.” It is also possible, AJ argues, that we exist in a multiverse—an idea first floated by the physicist Hugh Everett III in the 1950s. If people are somehow traveling between these parallel universes, then they may have memories from different worlds. Both of these theories are recurrent in the Mandela effect community online.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet AJ doesn’t find these explanations entirely fulfilling: “If we jumped universes, why would there be residue?” Instead, he’s been diving into a combination of the theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler’s concept of the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)—which suggests, controversially, that the act of observation creates reality—and the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Eugene Wigner’s “friend” experiment, which theorized that two observers can experience two different realities. AJ believes that physicists’ own work may be affecting the universe: “It’s almost like you’re changing the parameters of reality itself by digging deeper.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is still so much that the experts themselves can’t explain about quantum physics, so it’s no wonder that laypeople get confused. The internet offers myriad rabbit holes to go down, some of them legitimate and some of them less so. Things are complicated further when YouTubers and internet commenters who aren’t well versed in the science take specific, highly complex theories and experiments and try to apply them to other phenomena, even if there is no concrete evidence they’re related. So I set about emailing physicists, simply to see whether they believe it might be remotely possible that quantum physics could, in fact, explain the Mandela effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Numerous academics replied telling me they had nothing to say on the topic; Bostrom’s office said he was unavailable. I asked the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli—who has been labelled one of the world’s 50 top thinkers—whether he has any thoughts about Mandela effect believers’ quantum-physics-related theories. “Yes, definitely,” he replied. “They are all total bullshit! There are few things about which I am totally convinced. This is one.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I contacted the University of Oxford physicist David Deutsch—often called the “father of quantum computing”—and listed the theories believers think may explain the Mandela effect, including parallel universes, simulations, the holographic principle, PAP, and Wigner’s friend idea. “Considered as explanations of the Mandela effect, none of those follow from quantum theory, and none of them constitute a rational speculation beyond it,” he said. Johns Hopkins University professor and physicist Sean M. Carroll concurs: “I cannot imagine how any of those phenomena could be in any way related to the Mandela effect.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Melvin Vopson, an associate professor of physics at the University of Portsmouth who has conducted research on the simulation theory, admits he has experienced the Mandela effect himself but doesn’t attribute the phenomenon to glitches in the simulation: That’d be a “cheap explanation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, scientists waving away these explanations could have a detrimental effect: In the absence of expert engagement, there are plenty of people online who can bolster believers’ views. AJ is not surprised by these responses: “I just don’t think that physicists have given it a real hard look,” he says, “because they’re already certain that it’s explainable otherwise.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bainbridge, for her part, thinks her study at least disproves the theory that we’ve been jumping between different universes. When she took those study participants who weren’t familiar with certain logos and mascots and showed them the correct version for the first time, she tested their memory by asking them to redraw the image only moments later, and still some drew the Mandela effect version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s unlikely we jumped dimensions during that short time span,” she says, “so it seems like the Mandela effect is something more about the shortcuts our memories take, rather than something about parallel worlds.” She hopes her future work will help further elucidate these “shortcuts,” and she is even planning to see whether she can create her own Mandela effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Leaving it all behind&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the most well-documented memory phenomena is the “misinformation effect.” Since the 1970s, scientists have demonstrated that exposing people to misinformation after an event can alter their memories. If people are asked leading questions—say, “Did you see the broken headlight?” rather than “Did you see a broken headlight?” after witnessing a crash—they are more likely to report seeing something they didn’t. But on the flip side, warning witnesses about the threat of misinformation before they recount an event can increase the accuracy of their memory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In short, the way information is presented to us is crucial. This is why it was pretty poor form for YouGov to poll Americans about the Fruit of the Loom logo with a question that was easily open to misinterpretation: “Does the logo for the clothing company Fruit of the Loom have a cornucopia of fruit in it, or not?” It is unclear here which part is in question—the cornucopia or the fruit. But it was also poor form that I didn’t mention this until now—nor did I mention that Neil deGrasse Tyson later changed his mind about simulation theory and is now “convinced” that we do not live in a simulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was also probably pretty misleading of me to start this article with a link-free reference to Brooke Hermann’s eBay-listed shirt, which she believes features a cornucopia but to my eyes clearly features brown leaves. From the ’60s to the early ’00s, the Fruit of the Loom logo did include brown leaves behind the fruit; they were recolored green in 2003. When I started writing this article, I was certain that my Fruit of the Loom childhood PE kit had a cornucopia on the tag. I’m now convinced that 10-year-old me simply wasn’t looking that closely and thus I’ve misremembered the leaves as a horn. After all, even when I look at the current logo on shirts listed on the Fruit of the Loom website, my eyes still seem to want to make this mistake: From far away, I interpret the crowded cluster as a cornucopia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns non-stacked"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="current Fruit of the Loom logo in color" class="wp-image-1127168" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fruit-Of-The-Loom.svg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fruit of the Loom line drawing for trade application from 1973" class="wp-image-1127167" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/73006089-e1761771436941.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;The current Fruit of the Loom logo (left) and the version submitted in their 1973 trademark design application. Neither contain a cornucopia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s as easy as that to convince me my memory was wrong—whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’ll let you decide. I’m clearly at one end of some sort of spectrum here. Other Mandela effect experiencers may believe something stranger is going on but are still prepared to happily get on with their lives. Larry Jung is a thirtysomething musician who was living in New Jersey when he spent hours hunting for Fruit of the Loom residue; in 2019, he even purchased a copy of a 1969 book for around $20 so he could see the cornucopia reference within it. “I did obsess about it for a while in the beginning,” says Jung, who remembers the cornucopia because he mistook it for a croissant as a child. “But then—I don’t know, I just came to this acceptance phase. I just didn’t want it to affect my life in a big way. I didn’t want to bring it up in every discussion.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or, as another erstwhile Mandela effect researcher puts it: “If I just so happened to be living in a computer simulation, and that was my entire reality, what can I do about that?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don, the Mandela effect subreddit moderator, has seen waves of people move on while he has stayed active in the community for the better part of a decade (I first spoke to him for my &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;article in 2016). “I’ve recruited a lot of moderators, and they come and go pretty quick,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don says he experiences “more than average but less than all” examples of the Mandela effect (he too remembers the cornucopia on his childhood underpants). “They find solutions that they find acceptable,” he says of some people who leave the sub. For others, the cognitive dissonance becomes “too much,” he adds. “It interferes with their ability to function.” Don theorizes that the people who stay are people who experienced the Mandela effect organically, “in the wild,” he says, “before it was a well-known phenomenon”—arguably the antithesis of people jumping on an internet bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I compare it to someone who saw Bigfoot. If you were in the woods and Bigfoot walks into your campground and he scares you and your kids, eight feet tall, smells terrible—you’re not going to forget it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AJ concurs that “anchor memories” like these are key. And yet Jung has a croissant-based anchor memory, and I myself have similar anecdotes about false memories I’ve found easy to let go. Psychologically, why does the Mandela effect affect people in such vastly different ways? Why do some people hold onto their memories while others don’t?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We know that most people’s intuitions about memory are wrong; they think of it as an accurate recording device when in fact memory is a reconstructive apparatus that is presenting us with recollections based on very fragmented snippets,” says Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol who writes computer simulations of memory to better understand how the mind works. “So most people will have an exaggerated sense of the accuracy of their own memories and will refuse to accept that they could be completely false.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Lewandowsky has studied misinformation and has coauthored &lt;em&gt;The Conspiracy Theory Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, and he says that while some people move on from their conspiracy theories, others turn them into their identity. “They will enter a state,” he says, “in which they are extremely difficult to extract from their rabbit hole.” People who become highly committed to conspiracies “tend to be disgruntled and feel left behind by society and are extremely distrustful,” Lewandowsky adds. “Those people also tend to be high in narcissism and often exhibit paranoid thoughts.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shauna Bowes is an assistant psychology professor at the University of Alabama who researches conspiratorial ideation, misinformation, and intellectual humility. Her work has found that people with this last quality—the tendency to acknowledge the limits of your own views—are less likely to believe misinformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Belief perseverance is when you double down on your beliefs, even if evidence contradicts them,” Bowes says. “There are many reasons why some are willing to change their minds while others do not. Personality traits, childhood experiences, social networks, cognitive styles, and more determine these processes. What we do know is that people who tend to be more cognitively flexible, humble, and generally open-minded also tend to change their minds more in response to evidence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet when it comes to the Mandela effect, the question of “evidence” is a complicated one—after all, there’s plenty of cornucopia residue. Part of the trouble with understanding people’s responses to the Mandela effect is that the phenomenon can’t neatly be categorized as misinformation or conspiracy theory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lewandowsky believes the Mandela effect is primarily a social phenomenon. “My take on it is that if many people believe that an event has happened, that becomes a social norm that other people can support by sharing that belief. Social norms are very powerful,” he says, adding that the internet “provides a great amplification machine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Creating reality&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AJ tells me that even though skeptics have called him “so many derogatory names over the last nine years,” he remains passionate about spreading word of the Mandela effect. He wants to “push a dialogue” so that believers don’t feel afraid to speak out. Mostly, AJ wants scientists to look at the &lt;em&gt;qualitative&lt;/em&gt; side of things: the hundreds of autobiographical accounts by people with very specific memories of things that are now officially said not to have happened the way they recall. He wishes scientists would speak to experiencers directly, the same way the once-skeptical astronomer Josef Allen Hynek spoke to UFO eyewitnesses in the mid-20th century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Once upon a time, the UFO phenomenon was considered to be fringe. And now we have multiple world governments that have acknowledged that there is stuff flying around that we don’t know what it is,” AJ says. Overall, “the goal is to get the scientific establishment to at least consider the other side.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, AJ is not alone, even if Mandela effect believers do exist on a spectrum. The community holds space for people having fun with the phenomenon, for those committed to just a single example of the effect, for others who dive in on a short-term basis before moving on—and for those who have run the International Mandela Effect Conference in locations across the US since 2019.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there’s Don, who is still moderating the subreddit after all these years and has seen believers of every stripe. “The thing that keeps me going is I want to make sure that it’s still here,” he says. “There’s a lot of history here, and I want to keep it around for that reason.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, he believes there may be different explanations for different examples of the Mandela effect. It could be as simple as people confusing Fruit of the Loom with a knockoff brand, he says, or as complicated as Fruit of the Loom lying about the cornucopia as free advertising (though he also notes that no one has ever actually discovered an old Fruit of the Loom label with a cornucopia on it).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don also wonders whether some people might be guinea pigs caught up in longitudinal studies in which psychologists play with subjects’ memories. He’s considered, too, that nefarious tech bros could be digitally manipulating and deleting data on the internet as a form of social engineering, a possibility he compares to the Cambridge Analytica affair. “It’s something that’s possible. I’m not saying that’s what’s happening,” he says. “But this is the kind of thing that could be being done.” (To be clear: Don shared no evidence that this is being done.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Don’s most interesting belief is that the Mandela effect is not a phenomenon but an “event”—one that may now in fact be over. In his opinion, there have been no significant or “persuasive” examples discovered since 2019 (when Redditors found that the character Baloo in Disney’s 1967 &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; never wore a coconut bra). Don believes the community peaked between 2015 and 2018, when people were making new discoveries regularly. “There was a period of time where it was an actual event, like this was an ongoing event,” he says. He compares the whole thing to medieval manias in which people danced themselves to death: “I think the fervor with which the Mandela effect spread will likely be compared to dancing plagues by future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toward the end of my second of three calls with AJ, he asked me if I’d also experienced the Mandela effect. I explained that historically I experienced it with Fruit of the Loom, but I’m prepared to believe it was just a false memory. “Yeah, that’s fair,” he said. But I started to wonder if it is. When I wrote about the Mandela effect in 2016, I wanted to write an exciting story with twists and turns, which arguably played up the mystery. Am I responsible for making some people question reality? What are the consequences of writing another article, the one you’re currently reading? How much am I creating reality by observing it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be “fair” to AJ, should I tell you that one of memory science’s most famous studies has recently come under fire, and some academics now believe that people aren’t as susceptible to false memories as we once thought?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or to be “fair” to you, the reader, should I stress that despite my own desire to believe in the mysteries of the universe, I’ve come away thinking that the biggest mystery of all is the human mind?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia Tait is a London-based freelance features journalist who writes about culture, trends, and unusual phenomena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126705/mandela-effect-fruit-of-the-loom-psychology/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why it’s so hard to bust the weather control conspiracy theory (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126467/weather-control-conspiracy-theory-cloud-seeding-floods/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was October 2024, and Hurricane Helene had just devastated the US Southeast. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia found an abstract target on which to pin the blame: “Yes they can control the weather,” she posted on X. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was no word on who “they” were, but maybe it was better that way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was repeating what’s by now a pretty familiar and popular conspiracy theory: that shadowy forces are out there, wielding unknown technology to control the weather and wreak havoc on their supposed enemies. This claim, fundamentally preposterous from a scientific standpoint, has grown louder and more common in recent years. It pops up over and over when extreme weather strikes: in Dubai in April 2024, in Australia in July 2022, in the US after California floods and hurricanes like Helene and Milton. In the UK, conspiracy theorists claimed that the government had fixed the weather to be sunny and rain-free during the first covid lockdown in March 2020. Most recently, the theories spread again when disastrous floods hit central Texas this past July. The idea has even inspired some antigovernment extremists to threaten and try to destroy weather radar towers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: While Greene and other believers are not correct, this conspiracy theory—like so many others—holds a kernel of much more modest truth behind the grandiose claims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, there is no current way for humans to &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; the weather. We can’t cause major floods or redirect hurricanes or other powerful storm systems, simply because the energy involved is far too great for humans to alter significantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are ways we can &lt;em&gt;modify&lt;/em&gt; the weather. The key difference is the scale of what is possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The most common weather modification practice is called cloud seeding, and it involves injecting small amounts of salts or other materials into clouds with the goal of juicing levels of rain or snow. This is typically done in dry areas that lack regular precipitation. Research shows that it can in fact work, though advances in technology reveal that its impact is modest—coaxing maybe 5% to 10% more moisture out of otherwise stubborn clouds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the fact that humans can influence weather at all gives conspiracy theorists a foothold in the truth. Add to this a spotty history of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; efforts by governments and militaries to control major storms, as well as other emerging but not-yet-deployed-at-any-scale technologies that aim to address climate change … and you can see where things get confusing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So while more sweeping claims of weather control are ultimately ridiculous from a scientific standpoint, they can’t be dismissed as entirely stupid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This all helped make the conspiracy theories swirling after the recent Texas floods particularly loud and powerful. Just days earlier, 100 miles away from the epicenter of the floods, in a town called Runge, the cloud-seeding company Rainmaker had flown a single-engine plane and released about 70 grams of silver iodide into some clouds; a modest drizzle of less than half a centimeter of rain followed. But once the company saw a storm front in the forecast, it suspended its work; there was no need to seed with rain already on the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We conducted an operation on July 2, totally within the scope of what we were regulatorily permitted to do,” Augustus Doricko, Rainmaker’s founder and CEO, recently told me. Still, when as much as 20 inches of rain fell soon afterward not too far away, and more than 100 people died, the conspiracy theory machine whirred into action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Doricko told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; in the tragedy’s aftermath, he and his company faced “nonstop pandemonium” on social media; eventually someone even posted photos from outside Rainmaker’s office, along with its address. Doricko told me a few factors played into the pile-on, including a lack of familiarity with the specifics of cloud seeding, as well as what he called “deliberately inflammatory messaging from politicians.” Indeed, theories about Rainmaker and cloud seeding spread online via prominent figures including Greene and former national security advisor Mike Flynn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all this is happening at the same time as the warming climate is making heavy rainfall and the floods that accompany it more and more likely. “These events will become more frequent,” says Emily Yeh, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado who has examined approaches and reactions to weather modification around the world. “There is a large, vocal group of people who are willing to believe anything but climate change as the reason for Texas floods, or hurricanes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Worsening extremes, increasing weather modification activity, improving technology, a sometimes shady track record—the conditions are perfect for an otherwise niche conspiracy theory to spread to anyone desperate for tidy explanations of increasingly disastrous events.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, we break down just what’s possible and what isn’t—and address some of the more colorful reasons why people may believe things that go far beyond the facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do with the weather—and who is doing it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The basic concepts behind cloud seeding have been around for about 80 years, and government interest in the topic goes back even longer than that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The primary practice involves using planes, drones, or generators on the ground to inject tiny particles of stuff, usually silver iodide, into existing clouds. The particles act as nuclei around which moisture can build up, forming ice crystals that can get heavy enough to fall out of the cloud as snow or rain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Weather modification is an old field; starting in the 1940s there was a lot of excitement,” says David Delene, a research professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of North Dakota and an expert on cloud seeding. In a US Senate report from 1952 to establish a committee to study weather modification, authors noted that a small amount of extra rain could “produce electric power worth hundreds of thousands of dollars” and “greatly increase crop yields.” It also cited potential uses like “reducing soil erosion,” “breaking up hurricanes,” and even “cutting holes in clouds so that aircraft can operate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127349" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-old-weather-balloon_c8297b.jpg?w=2228" width="2228" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, as Delene adds, “that excitement … was not realized.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Through the 1980s, extensive research often funded or conducted by Washington yielded a much better understanding of atmospheric science and cloud physics, though it proved extremely difficult to actually demonstrate the efficacy of the technology itself. In other words, scientists learned the basic principles behind cloud seeding, and understood on a theoretical level that it should work—but it was hard to tell how big an impact it was having on rainfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is huge variability between one cloud and another, one storm system and another, one mountain or valley and another; for decades, the tools available to researchers did not really allow for firm conclusions on exactly how much extra moisture, if any, they were getting out of any given operation. Interest in the practice died down to a low hum by the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But over the past couple of decades, the early excitement has returned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cloud seeding can enhance levels of rain and snow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the core technology has largely stayed the same, several projects launched in the US and abroad starting in the 2000s have combined statistical modeling with new and improved aircraft-based measurements, ground-based radar, and more to provide better answers on what results are actually achievable when seeding clouds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think we’ve identified unequivocally that we can indeed modify the cloud,” says Jeff French, an associate professor and head of the University of Wyoming’s Department of Atmospheric Science, who has worked for years on the topic. But even as scientists have come to largely agree that the practice can have an impact on precipitation, they also largely recognize that the impact probably has some fairly modest upper limits—far short of massive water surges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is absolutely no evidence that cloud seeding can modify a cloud to the extent that would be needed to cause a flood,” French says. Floods require a few factors, he adds—a system with plenty of moisture available that stays localized to a certain spot for an extended period. “All of these things which cloud seeding has zero effect on,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology simply operates on a different level. “Cloud seeding really is looking at making an inefficient system a little bit more efficient,” French says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As Delene puts it: “Originally [researchers] thought, well, we could, you know, do 50%, 100% increases in precipitation,” but “I think if you do a good program you’re not going to get more than a 10% increase.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Asked for his take on a theoretical limit, French was hesitant—“I don’t know if I’m ready to stick my neck out”—but agreed on “maybe 10-ish percent” as a reasonable guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another cloud seeding expert, Katja Friedrich from the University of Colorado–Boulder, says that any grander potential would be obvious by this point: We wouldn’t have “spent the last 100 years debating—within the scientific community—if cloud seeding works,” she writes in an email. “It would have been easy to separate the signal (from cloud seeding) from the noise (natural precipitation).”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It can also (probably) suppress precipitation&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes cloud seeding is used not to boost rain and snow but rather to try to reduce its severity—or, more specifically, to change the size of individual rain droplets or hailstones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent examples has been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in parts of Canada, where hailstorms can be devastating; a 2024 event in Calgary, for instance, was the country’s second-most-expensive disaster ever, with over $2 billion in damages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Insurance companies in Alberta have been working together for nearly three decades on a cloud seeding program that’s aimed at reducing some of that damage. In these cases, the silver iodide or other particles are meant to act essentially as competition for other “embryos” inside the cloud, increasing the total number of hailstones and thus reducing each individual stone’s average size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Smaller hailstones means less damage when they reach the ground. The insurance companies—which continue to pay for the program—say losses have been cut by 50% since the program started, though scientists aren’t quite as confident in its overall success. A 2023 study published in &lt;em&gt;Atmospheric Research &lt;/em&gt;examined 10 years of cloud seeding efforts in the province and found that the practice did appear to reduce potential for damage in about 60% of seeded storms—while in others, it had no effect or was even associated with increased hail (though the authors said this could have been due to natural variation).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similar techniques are also sometimes deployed to try to improve the daily forecast just a bit. During the 2008 Olympics, for instance, China engaged in a form of cloud seeding aimed at reducing rainfall. As &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; detailed back then, officials with the Beijing Weather Modification Office planned to use a liquid-nitrogen-based coolant that could increase the number of water droplets in a cloud while reducing their size; this can get droplets to stay aloft a little longer instead of falling out of the cloud. Though it is tough to prove that it definitively &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have rained without the effort, the targeted opening ceremony did stay dry.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So, where is this happening?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization says that some form of weather modification is taking place in “more than 50 countries” and that “demand for these weather modification activities is increasing steadily due to the incidence of droughts and other calamities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest user of cloud-seeding tech is arguably China. Following the work around the Olympics, the country announced a huge expansion of its weather modification program in 2020, claiming it would eventually run operations for agricultural relief and other functions, including hail suppression, over an area about the size of India and Algeria combined. Since then, China has occasionally announced bits of progress—including updates to weather modification aircraft and the first use of drones for artificial snow enhancement. Overall, it spends billions on the practice, with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127351" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-2plane.jpg?w=2382" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, desert countries have taken an interest. In 2024, Saudi Arabia announced an expanded research program on cloud seeding—Delene, of the University of North Dakota, was part of a team that conducted experiments in various parts of that country in late 2023. Its neighbor the United Arab Emirates began “rain enhancement” activities back in 1990; this program too has faced outcry, especially after more than a typical year’s worth of rain fell in a single day in 2024, causing massive flooding. (&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; recently published a story about persistent questions regarding the country’s cloud seeding program; in response to the story, French wrote in an email that the “best scientific understanding is still that cloud seeding CANNOT lead to these types of events.” Other experts we asked agreed.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the US, a 2024 Government Accountability Office report on cloud seeding said that at least nine states have active programs. These are sometimes run directly by the state and sometimes contracted out through nonprofits like the South Texas Weather Modification Association to private companies, including Doricko’s Rainmaker and North Dakota–based Weather Modification. In August, Doricko told me that Rainmaker had grown to 76 employees since it launched in 2023. It now runs cloud seeding operations in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Texas, as well as forecasting services in New Mexico and Arizona. And in an answer that may further fuel the conspiracy fire, he added they are also operating in one Middle Eastern country; when I asked which one, he’d only say, “Can’t tell you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What we cannot do&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The versions of weather modification that the conspiracy theorists envision most often—significantly altering monsoons or hurricanes or making the skies clear and sunny for weeks at a time—have so far proved impossible to carry out. But that’s not necessarily for lack of trying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US government attempted to alter a hurricane in 1947 as part of a program dubbed Project Cirrus. In collaboration with GE, government scientists seeded clouds with pellets of dry ice, the idea being that the falling pellets could induce supercooled liquid in the clouds to crystallize into ice. After they did this, the storm took a sharp left turn and struck the area around Savannah, Georgia. This was a significant moment for budding conspiracy theories, since a GE scientist who had been working with the government said he was “99% sure” the cyclone swerved because of their work. Other experts disagreed and showed that such storm trajectories are, in reality, perfectly possible without intervention. Perhaps unsurprisingly, public outrage and threats of lawsuits followed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took some time for the hubbub to die down, after which several US government agencies continued—unsuccessfully—trying to alter and weaken hurricanes with a long-running cloud seeding program called Project Stormfury. Around the same time, the US military joined the fray with Operation Popeye, essentially trying to harness weather as a weapon in the Vietnam War—engaging in cloud seeding efforts over Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with an eye toward increasing monsoon rains and bogging down the enemy. Though it was never really clear whether these efforts worked, the Nixon administration tried to deny them, going so far as to lie to the public and even to congressional committees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127352" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-nixon.jpg?w=1915" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More recently and less menacingly, there have been experiments with Dyn-O-Gel—a Florida company’s super-absorbent powder, intended to be dropped into storm clouds to sop up their moisture. In the early 2000s, the company carried out experiments with the stuff in thunderstorms, and it had grand plans to use it to weaken tropical cyclones. But according to one former NOAA scientist, you would need to drop almost 38,000 tons of it, requiring nearly 380 individual plane trips, in and around even a relatively small cyclone’s eyewall to really affect the storm’s strength. And then you would have to do that again an hour and a half later, and so on. Reality tends to get in the way of the biggest weather modification ideas.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Beyond trying to control storms, there are some other potential weather modification technologies out there that are either just getting started or have never taken off. Swiss researchers have tried to use powerful lasers to induce cloud formation, for example; in Australia, where climate change is imperiling the Great Barrier Reef, artificial clouds created when ship-based nozzles spray moisture into the sky have been used to try to protect the vital ecosystem. In each case, the efforts remain small, localized, and not remotely close to achieving the kinds of control the conspiracy theorists allege.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is not weather modification—but gets lumped in with it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further worsening weather control conspiracies is that there is a tendency to conflate cloud seeding and other promising weather modification research with concepts such as chemtrails—a full-on conspiracist fever dream about innocuous condensation trails left by jets—and solar geoengineering, a theoretical stopgap to cool the planet that has been subject to much discussion and modeling research but has never been deployed in any large-scale way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One controversial form of solar geoengineering, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, would involve having high-altitude jets drop tiny aerosol particles—sulfur dioxide, most likely—into the stratosphere to act essentially as tiny mirrors. They would reflect a small amount of sunlight back into space, leaving less energy to reach the ground and contribute to warming. To date, attempts to launch physical experiments in this space have been shouted down, and only tiny—though still controversial—commercial efforts have taken place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One can see why it gets lumped in with cloud seeding: bits of stuff, dumped into the sky, with the aim of altering what happens down below. But the aims are entirely separate;&amp;nbsp;geoengineering would alter the global average temperature rather than having measurable effects on momentary cloudbursts or hailstorms. Some research has suggested that the practice could alter monsoon patterns, a significant issue given their importance to much of the world’s agriculture, but it remains a fundamentally different practice from cloud seeding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the political conversation around supposed weather control often reflects this confusion. Greene, for instance, introduced a bill in July called the Clear Skies Act, which would ban all weather modification &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; geoengineering activities. (Greene’s congressional office did not respond to a request for comment.) And last year, Tennessee became the first state to enact a law to prohibit the “intentional injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical compounds, substances, or apparatus … into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.” Florida followed suit, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing SB 56 into law in June of this year for the same stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also this year, lawmakers in more than 20 other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;states have also proposed some version of a ban on weather modification, often lumping it in with geoengineering, even though caution on the latter is more widely accepted or endorsed. “It’s not a conspiracy theory,” one Pennsylvania lawmaker who cosponsored a similar bill told NBC News. “All you have to do is look up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, as Yeh of the University of Colorado points out, the places where bans have passed are states where weather modification isn’t really happening. “In a way, it’s easy for them to ban it, because, you know, nothing actually has to be done,” she says. In general, neither Florida nor Tennessee—nor any other part of the Southeast—needs any help finding rain. Basically, all weather modification activity in the US happens in the drier areas west of the Mississippi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Finding a culprit&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doricko told me that in the wake of the Texas disaster, he has seen more people become willing to learn about the true capabilities of cloud seeding and move past the more sinister theories about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked him, though, about some of his company’s flashier branding: Until recently, visitors to the Rainmaker website were greeted right up top with the slogan “Making Earth Habitable.” Might this level of hype&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contribute to public misunderstanding or fear?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He said he is indeed aware that Earth is, currently, habitable, and called the slogan a “tongue-in-cheek, deliberately provocative statement.” Still, in contrast to the academics who seem more comfortable acknowledging weather modification’s limits, he has continued to tout its revolutionary potential. “If we don’t produce more water, then a lot of the Earth will become &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; habitable,” he said. “By producing more water via cloud seeding, we’re helping to conserve the ecosystems that do currently exist, that are at risk of collapse.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While other experts cited that 10% figure as a likely upper limit of cloud seeding’s effectiveness, Doricko said they could eventually approach 20%, though that might be years away. “Is it literally magic? Like, can I snap my fingers and turn the Sahara green? No,” he said. “But can it help make a greener, verdant, and abundant world? Yeah, absolutely.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126736" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-mtg.png?w=1926" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not all that hard to see why people still cling to magical thinking here. The changing climate is, after all, offering up what’s essentially weaponized weather, only with a much broader and long-term mechanism behind it. There is no single sinister agency or company with its finger on the trigger, though it can be tempting to look for one; rather, we just have an atmosphere capable of holding more moisture and dropping it onto ill-prepared communities, and many of the people in power are doing little to mitigate the impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Governments are not doing a good job of responding to the climate crisis; they are often captured by fossil-fuel interests, which drive policy, and they can be slow and ineffective when responding to disasters,” Naomi Smith, a lecturer in sociology at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia who has written about conspiracy theories and weather events, writes in an email. “It’s hard to hold all this complexity, and conspiracy theorizing is one way of making it intelligible and understandable.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Conspiracy theories give us a ‘big bad’ to point the finger at, someone to blame and a place to put our feelings of anger, despair, and grief,” she writes. “It’s much less satisfying to yell at the weather, or to engage in the sustained collective action we actually need to tackle climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sinister “they” in Greene’s accusations is, in other words, a far easier target than the real culprit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dave Levitan is an independent journalist, focused on science, politics, and policy.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia found an abstract target on which to pin the blame: “Yes they can control the weather,” she posted on X. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was no word on who “they” were, but maybe it was better that way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was repeating what’s by now a pretty familiar and popular conspiracy theory: that shadowy forces are out there, wielding unknown technology to control the weather and wreak havoc on their supposed enemies. This claim, fundamentally preposterous from a scientific standpoint, has grown louder and more common in recent years. It pops up over and over when extreme weather strikes: in Dubai in April 2024, in Australia in July 2022, in the US after California floods and hurricanes like Helene and Milton. In the UK, conspiracy theorists claimed that the government had fixed the weather to be sunny and rain-free during the first covid lockdown in March 2020. Most recently, the theories spread again when disastrous floods hit central Texas this past July. The idea has even inspired some antigovernment extremists to threaten and try to destroy weather radar towers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: While Greene and other believers are not correct, this conspiracy theory—like so many others—holds a kernel of much more modest truth behind the grandiose claims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, there is no current way for humans to &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; the weather. We can’t cause major floods or redirect hurricanes or other powerful storm systems, simply because the energy involved is far too great for humans to alter significantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are ways we can &lt;em&gt;modify&lt;/em&gt; the weather. The key difference is the scale of what is possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The most common weather modification practice is called cloud seeding, and it involves injecting small amounts of salts or other materials into clouds with the goal of juicing levels of rain or snow. This is typically done in dry areas that lack regular precipitation. Research shows that it can in fact work, though advances in technology reveal that its impact is modest—coaxing maybe 5% to 10% more moisture out of otherwise stubborn clouds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the fact that humans can influence weather at all gives conspiracy theorists a foothold in the truth. Add to this a spotty history of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; efforts by governments and militaries to control major storms, as well as other emerging but not-yet-deployed-at-any-scale technologies that aim to address climate change … and you can see where things get confusing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So while more sweeping claims of weather control are ultimately ridiculous from a scientific standpoint, they can’t be dismissed as entirely stupid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This all helped make the conspiracy theories swirling after the recent Texas floods particularly loud and powerful. Just days earlier, 100 miles away from the epicenter of the floods, in a town called Runge, the cloud-seeding company Rainmaker had flown a single-engine plane and released about 70 grams of silver iodide into some clouds; a modest drizzle of less than half a centimeter of rain followed. But once the company saw a storm front in the forecast, it suspended its work; there was no need to seed with rain already on the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We conducted an operation on July 2, totally within the scope of what we were regulatorily permitted to do,” Augustus Doricko, Rainmaker’s founder and CEO, recently told me. Still, when as much as 20 inches of rain fell soon afterward not too far away, and more than 100 people died, the conspiracy theory machine whirred into action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Doricko told the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; in the tragedy’s aftermath, he and his company faced “nonstop pandemonium” on social media; eventually someone even posted photos from outside Rainmaker’s office, along with its address. Doricko told me a few factors played into the pile-on, including a lack of familiarity with the specifics of cloud seeding, as well as what he called “deliberately inflammatory messaging from politicians.” Indeed, theories about Rainmaker and cloud seeding spread online via prominent figures including Greene and former national security advisor Mike Flynn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all this is happening at the same time as the warming climate is making heavy rainfall and the floods that accompany it more and more likely. “These events will become more frequent,” says Emily Yeh, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado who has examined approaches and reactions to weather modification around the world. “There is a large, vocal group of people who are willing to believe anything but climate change as the reason for Texas floods, or hurricanes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Worsening extremes, increasing weather modification activity, improving technology, a sometimes shady track record—the conditions are perfect for an otherwise niche conspiracy theory to spread to anyone desperate for tidy explanations of increasingly disastrous events.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, we break down just what’s possible and what isn’t—and address some of the more colorful reasons why people may believe things that go far beyond the facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do with the weather—and who is doing it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The basic concepts behind cloud seeding have been around for about 80 years, and government interest in the topic goes back even longer than that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The primary practice involves using planes, drones, or generators on the ground to inject tiny particles of stuff, usually silver iodide, into existing clouds. The particles act as nuclei around which moisture can build up, forming ice crystals that can get heavy enough to fall out of the cloud as snow or rain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Weather modification is an old field; starting in the 1940s there was a lot of excitement,” says David Delene, a research professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of North Dakota and an expert on cloud seeding. In a US Senate report from 1952 to establish a committee to study weather modification, authors noted that a small amount of extra rain could “produce electric power worth hundreds of thousands of dollars” and “greatly increase crop yields.” It also cited potential uses like “reducing soil erosion,” “breaking up hurricanes,” and even “cutting holes in clouds so that aircraft can operate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127349" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-old-weather-balloon_c8297b.jpg?w=2228" width="2228" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, as Delene adds, “that excitement … was not realized.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Through the 1980s, extensive research often funded or conducted by Washington yielded a much better understanding of atmospheric science and cloud physics, though it proved extremely difficult to actually demonstrate the efficacy of the technology itself. In other words, scientists learned the basic principles behind cloud seeding, and understood on a theoretical level that it should work—but it was hard to tell how big an impact it was having on rainfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is huge variability between one cloud and another, one storm system and another, one mountain or valley and another; for decades, the tools available to researchers did not really allow for firm conclusions on exactly how much extra moisture, if any, they were getting out of any given operation. Interest in the practice died down to a low hum by the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But over the past couple of decades, the early excitement has returned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cloud seeding can enhance levels of rain and snow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the core technology has largely stayed the same, several projects launched in the US and abroad starting in the 2000s have combined statistical modeling with new and improved aircraft-based measurements, ground-based radar, and more to provide better answers on what results are actually achievable when seeding clouds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think we’ve identified unequivocally that we can indeed modify the cloud,” says Jeff French, an associate professor and head of the University of Wyoming’s Department of Atmospheric Science, who has worked for years on the topic. But even as scientists have come to largely agree that the practice can have an impact on precipitation, they also largely recognize that the impact probably has some fairly modest upper limits—far short of massive water surges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is absolutely no evidence that cloud seeding can modify a cloud to the extent that would be needed to cause a flood,” French says. Floods require a few factors, he adds—a system with plenty of moisture available that stays localized to a certain spot for an extended period. “All of these things which cloud seeding has zero effect on,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The technology simply operates on a different level. “Cloud seeding really is looking at making an inefficient system a little bit more efficient,” French says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As Delene puts it: “Originally [researchers] thought, well, we could, you know, do 50%, 100% increases in precipitation,” but “I think if you do a good program you’re not going to get more than a 10% increase.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Asked for his take on a theoretical limit, French was hesitant—“I don’t know if I’m ready to stick my neck out”—but agreed on “maybe 10-ish percent” as a reasonable guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another cloud seeding expert, Katja Friedrich from the University of Colorado–Boulder, says that any grander potential would be obvious by this point: We wouldn’t have “spent the last 100 years debating—within the scientific community—if cloud seeding works,” she writes in an email. “It would have been easy to separate the signal (from cloud seeding) from the noise (natural precipitation).”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It can also (probably) suppress precipitation&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes cloud seeding is used not to boost rain and snow but rather to try to reduce its severity—or, more specifically, to change the size of individual rain droplets or hailstones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_15"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent examples has been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in parts of Canada, where hailstorms can be devastating; a 2024 event in Calgary, for instance, was the country’s second-most-expensive disaster ever, with over $2 billion in damages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Insurance companies in Alberta have been working together for nearly three decades on a cloud seeding program that’s aimed at reducing some of that damage. In these cases, the silver iodide or other particles are meant to act essentially as competition for other “embryos” inside the cloud, increasing the total number of hailstones and thus reducing each individual stone’s average size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Smaller hailstones means less damage when they reach the ground. The insurance companies—which continue to pay for the program—say losses have been cut by 50% since the program started, though scientists aren’t quite as confident in its overall success. A 2023 study published in &lt;em&gt;Atmospheric Research &lt;/em&gt;examined 10 years of cloud seeding efforts in the province and found that the practice did appear to reduce potential for damage in about 60% of seeded storms—while in others, it had no effect or was even associated with increased hail (though the authors said this could have been due to natural variation).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similar techniques are also sometimes deployed to try to improve the daily forecast just a bit. During the 2008 Olympics, for instance, China engaged in a form of cloud seeding aimed at reducing rainfall. As &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; detailed back then, officials with the Beijing Weather Modification Office planned to use a liquid-nitrogen-based coolant that could increase the number of water droplets in a cloud while reducing their size; this can get droplets to stay aloft a little longer instead of falling out of the cloud. Though it is tough to prove that it definitively &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have rained without the effort, the targeted opening ceremony did stay dry.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So, where is this happening?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization says that some form of weather modification is taking place in “more than 50 countries” and that “demand for these weather modification activities is increasing steadily due to the incidence of droughts and other calamities.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest user of cloud-seeding tech is arguably China. Following the work around the Olympics, the country announced a huge expansion of its weather modification program in 2020, claiming it would eventually run operations for agricultural relief and other functions, including hail suppression, over an area about the size of India and Algeria combined. Since then, China has occasionally announced bits of progress—including updates to weather modification aircraft and the first use of drones for artificial snow enhancement. Overall, it spends billions on the practice, with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127351" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-2plane.jpg?w=2382" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, desert countries have taken an interest. In 2024, Saudi Arabia announced an expanded research program on cloud seeding—Delene, of the University of North Dakota, was part of a team that conducted experiments in various parts of that country in late 2023. Its neighbor the United Arab Emirates began “rain enhancement” activities back in 1990; this program too has faced outcry, especially after more than a typical year’s worth of rain fell in a single day in 2024, causing massive flooding. (&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; recently published a story about persistent questions regarding the country’s cloud seeding program; in response to the story, French wrote in an email that the “best scientific understanding is still that cloud seeding CANNOT lead to these types of events.” Other experts we asked agreed.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the US, a 2024 Government Accountability Office report on cloud seeding said that at least nine states have active programs. These are sometimes run directly by the state and sometimes contracted out through nonprofits like the South Texas Weather Modification Association to private companies, including Doricko’s Rainmaker and North Dakota–based Weather Modification. In August, Doricko told me that Rainmaker had grown to 76 employees since it launched in 2023. It now runs cloud seeding operations in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Texas, as well as forecasting services in New Mexico and Arizona. And in an answer that may further fuel the conspiracy fire, he added they are also operating in one Middle Eastern country; when I asked which one, he’d only say, “Can’t tell you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What we cannot do&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The versions of weather modification that the conspiracy theorists envision most often—significantly altering monsoons or hurricanes or making the skies clear and sunny for weeks at a time—have so far proved impossible to carry out. But that’s not necessarily for lack of trying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US government attempted to alter a hurricane in 1947 as part of a program dubbed Project Cirrus. In collaboration with GE, government scientists seeded clouds with pellets of dry ice, the idea being that the falling pellets could induce supercooled liquid in the clouds to crystallize into ice. After they did this, the storm took a sharp left turn and struck the area around Savannah, Georgia. This was a significant moment for budding conspiracy theories, since a GE scientist who had been working with the government said he was “99% sure” the cyclone swerved because of their work. Other experts disagreed and showed that such storm trajectories are, in reality, perfectly possible without intervention. Perhaps unsurprisingly, public outrage and threats of lawsuits followed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took some time for the hubbub to die down, after which several US government agencies continued—unsuccessfully—trying to alter and weaken hurricanes with a long-running cloud seeding program called Project Stormfury. Around the same time, the US military joined the fray with Operation Popeye, essentially trying to harness weather as a weapon in the Vietnam War—engaging in cloud seeding efforts over Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with an eye toward increasing monsoon rains and bogging down the enemy. Though it was never really clear whether these efforts worked, the Nixon administration tried to deny them, going so far as to lie to the public and even to congressional committees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127352" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-nixon.jpg?w=1915" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More recently and less menacingly, there have been experiments with Dyn-O-Gel—a Florida company’s super-absorbent powder, intended to be dropped into storm clouds to sop up their moisture. In the early 2000s, the company carried out experiments with the stuff in thunderstorms, and it had grand plans to use it to weaken tropical cyclones. But according to one former NOAA scientist, you would need to drop almost 38,000 tons of it, requiring nearly 380 individual plane trips, in and around even a relatively small cyclone’s eyewall to really affect the storm’s strength. And then you would have to do that again an hour and a half later, and so on. Reality tends to get in the way of the biggest weather modification ideas.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Beyond trying to control storms, there are some other potential weather modification technologies out there that are either just getting started or have never taken off. Swiss researchers have tried to use powerful lasers to induce cloud formation, for example; in Australia, where climate change is imperiling the Great Barrier Reef, artificial clouds created when ship-based nozzles spray moisture into the sky have been used to try to protect the vital ecosystem. In each case, the efforts remain small, localized, and not remotely close to achieving the kinds of control the conspiracy theorists allege.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is not weather modification—but gets lumped in with it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further worsening weather control conspiracies is that there is a tendency to conflate cloud seeding and other promising weather modification research with concepts such as chemtrails—a full-on conspiracist fever dream about innocuous condensation trails left by jets—and solar geoengineering, a theoretical stopgap to cool the planet that has been subject to much discussion and modeling research but has never been deployed in any large-scale way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One controversial form of solar geoengineering, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, would involve having high-altitude jets drop tiny aerosol particles—sulfur dioxide, most likely—into the stratosphere to act essentially as tiny mirrors. They would reflect a small amount of sunlight back into space, leaving less energy to reach the ground and contribute to warming. To date, attempts to launch physical experiments in this space have been shouted down, and only tiny—though still controversial—commercial efforts have taken place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One can see why it gets lumped in with cloud seeding: bits of stuff, dumped into the sky, with the aim of altering what happens down below. But the aims are entirely separate;&amp;nbsp;geoengineering would alter the global average temperature rather than having measurable effects on momentary cloudbursts or hailstorms. Some research has suggested that the practice could alter monsoon patterns, a significant issue given their importance to much of the world’s agriculture, but it remains a fundamentally different practice from cloud seeding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the political conversation around supposed weather control often reflects this confusion. Greene, for instance, introduced a bill in July called the Clear Skies Act, which would ban all weather modification &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; geoengineering activities. (Greene’s congressional office did not respond to a request for comment.) And last year, Tennessee became the first state to enact a law to prohibit the “intentional injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical compounds, substances, or apparatus … into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.” Florida followed suit, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing SB 56 into law in June of this year for the same stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also this year, lawmakers in more than 20 other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;states have also proposed some version of a ban on weather modification, often lumping it in with geoengineering, even though caution on the latter is more widely accepted or endorsed. “It’s not a conspiracy theory,” one Pennsylvania lawmaker who cosponsored a similar bill told NBC News. “All you have to do is look up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, as Yeh of the University of Colorado points out, the places where bans have passed are states where weather modification isn’t really happening. “In a way, it’s easy for them to ban it, because, you know, nothing actually has to be done,” she says. In general, neither Florida nor Tennessee—nor any other part of the Southeast—needs any help finding rain. Basically, all weather modification activity in the US happens in the drier areas west of the Mississippi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Finding a culprit&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doricko told me that in the wake of the Texas disaster, he has seen more people become willing to learn about the true capabilities of cloud seeding and move past the more sinister theories about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked him, though, about some of his company’s flashier branding: Until recently, visitors to the Rainmaker website were greeted right up top with the slogan “Making Earth Habitable.” Might this level of hype&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contribute to public misunderstanding or fear?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He said he is indeed aware that Earth is, currently, habitable, and called the slogan a “tongue-in-cheek, deliberately provocative statement.” Still, in contrast to the academics who seem more comfortable acknowledging weather modification’s limits, he has continued to tout its revolutionary potential. “If we don’t produce more water, then a lot of the Earth will become &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; habitable,” he said. “By producing more water via cloud seeding, we’re helping to conserve the ecosystems that do currently exist, that are at risk of collapse.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While other experts cited that 10% figure as a likely upper limit of cloud seeding’s effectiveness, Doricko said they could eventually approach 20%, though that might be years away. “Is it literally magic? Like, can I snap my fingers and turn the Sahara green? No,” he said. “But can it help make a greener, verdant, and abundant world? Yeah, absolutely.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1126736" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6-Weather-Control-mtg.png?w=1926" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not all that hard to see why people still cling to magical thinking here. The changing climate is, after all, offering up what’s essentially weaponized weather, only with a much broader and long-term mechanism behind it. There is no single sinister agency or company with its finger on the trigger, though it can be tempting to look for one; rather, we just have an atmosphere capable of holding more moisture and dropping it onto ill-prepared communities, and many of the people in power are doing little to mitigate the impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Governments are not doing a good job of responding to the climate crisis; they are often captured by fossil-fuel interests, which drive policy, and they can be slow and ineffective when responding to disasters,” Naomi Smith, a lecturer in sociology at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia who has written about conspiracy theories and weather events, writes in an email. “It’s hard to hold all this complexity, and conspiracy theorizing is one way of making it intelligible and understandable.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Conspiracy theories give us a ‘big bad’ to point the finger at, someone to blame and a place to put our feelings of anger, despair, and grief,” she writes. “It’s much less satisfying to yell at the weather, or to engage in the sustained collective action we actually need to tackle climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The sinister “they” in Greene’s accusations is, in other words, a far easier target than the real culprit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dave Levitan is an independent journalist, focused on science, politics, and policy.

And although social media and other digital forums can be a lifeline for some people looking for a diagnosis or community, when that information is wrong, it can put their well-being and even lives in danger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this modern impulse to “do your own research” became even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We asked a number of health-care professionals about how this shifting landscape is changing their profession. They told us that they are being forced to adapt how they treat patients. It’s a wide range of experiences: Some say patients tell them they just want more information about certain treatments because they’re concerned about how effective they are. Others hear that their patients just don’t trust the powers that be. Still others say patients are rejecting evidence-based medicine altogether in favor of alternative theories they’ve come across online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are their stories, in their own words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interviews have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The physician trying to set shared goals&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Scales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Internal medicine hospitalist and assistant professor of medicine, &lt;br /&gt;Weill Cornell Medical College&lt;br /&gt;New York City&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every one of my colleagues has stories about patients who have been rejective of care, or had very peculiar perspectives on what their care should be. Sometimes that’s driven by religion. But I think what has changed is people, not necessarily with a religious standpoint, having very fixed beliefs that are sometimes—based on all the evidence that we have—in contradiction with their health goals. And that is a very challenging situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I once treated a patient with a connective tissue disease called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. While there’s no doubt that the illness exists, there’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty over which symptoms can be attributed to Ehlers-Danlos. This means it can fall into what social scientists call a “contested illness.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contested illnesses used to be causes for arguably fringe movements, but they have become much more prominent since the rise of social media in the mid-2010s. Patients often search for information that resonates with their experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This patient was very hesitant about various treatments, and it was clear she was getting her information from, I would say, suspect sources. She’d been following people online who were not necessarily trustworthy, so I sat down with her and we looked them up on Quackwatch, a site that lists health myths and misconduct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She was still accepting of treatment, and was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources and fixed beliefs that overemphasize particular things—like what symptoms might be attributable to other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Physicians have the tools to work with patients who are struggling with these challenges. The first is motivational interviewing, a counseling technique that was developed for people with substance-use disorders. It’s a nonjudgmental approach that uses open-ended questions to draw out people’s motivations, and to find where there’s a mismatch between their behaviors and their beliefs. It’s highly effective in treating people who are vaccine-hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another is an approach called shared decision-making. First we work out what the patient’s goals are and then figure out a way to align those with what we know about the evidence-based way to treat them.

At one point, I had an out-and-out conspiracy theorist say to me, “I might as well wear a yellow star like the Jews during the Holocaust, because I won’t get vaccinated.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I felt pure anger, and I reached a point in my therapeutic journey I didn’t know would ever occur—I’d found that I had a line that could be crossed by a client that I could not tolerate. I spoke in a very direct manner he probably wasn’t used to and challenged his conspiracy theory. He got very angry and hung up the call.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It made me figure out how I was going to deal with this in future, and to develop an approach—which was to not challenge the conspiracy theory, but to gently talk through it, to provide alternative points of view and ask questions. I try to find the therapeutic value in the information, in the conversations we’re having. My belief is and evidence seems to show that people believe in conspiracy theories because there’s something wrong in their life that is inexplicable, and they need something to explain what’s happening to them. And even if I have no belief or agreement whatsoever in what they’re saying, I think I need to sit here and have this conversation, because one day this person might snap out of it, and I need to be here when that happens.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;As a psychologist, you have to remember that these people who believe in these things are extremely vulnerable. So my anger around these conspiracy theories has changed from being directed toward the deliverer—the person sitting in front of me saying these things—to the people driving the theories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The emergency room doctor trying to get patients to reconnect with the evidence&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Aguilar Montalvan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Attending emergency medicine physician&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Queens, New York&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The emergency department is essentially the pulse of what is happening in society.

Now we’re shifting away from that, and the doctor is now more like a consultant or a customer service provider than the authority. I think that could be because we’ve seen a lot of bad actors in medicine, so the power dynamic has changed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think if we had a more unified approach at a national level, if they had an actual unified and transparent relationship with the population, that would set us up right. But I’m not sure we’ve ever had it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127161" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-Healthcare-spot.jpg?w=2047" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The psychologist who supported severely mentally ill patients through the pandemic&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michelle Sallee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psychologist, board certified in serious mental illness psychology&lt;br /&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m a clinical psychologist who only works with people who have been in the hospital three or more times in the last 12 months. I do both individual therapy and a lot of group work, and several years ago during the pandemic, I wrote a 10-week program for patients about how to cope with sheltering in place, following safety guidelines, and their concerns about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My groups were very structured around evidence-based practice, and I had rules for the groups. First, I would tell people that the goal was not to talk them out of their conspiracy theory; my goal was not to talk them into a vaccination. My goal was to provide a safe place for them to be able to talk about things that were terrifying to them. We wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, and the need for psychiatric hospitalizations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Half of the group was pro–public health requirements, and their paranoia and fear for safety was around people who don’t get vaccinated; the other half might have been strongly opposed to anyone other than themselves deciding they need a vaccination or a mask. Both sides were fearing for their lives—but from each other.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure everybody felt heard, and it was really important to be able to talk about what they believed—like, some people felt like the government was trying to track us and even kill us—without any judgment from other people. My theory is that if you allow people to talk freely about what's on their mind without blocking them with your own opinions or judgment, they will find their way eventually. And a lot of times that works.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory or their paranoia has been stuck on it for a long time because they're always fighting with people about it, everyone's telling them that this is not true. So we would just have an open discussion about these things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory for a long time because they're always fighting with people about it, everyone's telling them that this is not true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I ran the program four times for a total of 27 people, and the thing that I remember the most was how respectful and tolerant and empathic, but still honest about their feelings and opinions, everybody was. At the end of the program, most participants reported a decrease in pandemic-related stress. Half reported a decrease in general perceived stress, and half reported no change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d say that the rate of how much vaccines are talked about now is significantly lower, and covid doesn’t really come up anymore. But other medical illnesses come up—patients saying, “My doctor said I need to get this surgery, but I know who they’re working for.” Everybody has their concerns, but when a person with psychosis has concerns, it becomes delusional, paranoid, and psychotic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d like to see more providers be given more training around severe mental illness. These are not just people who just need to go to the hospital to get remedicated for a couple of days. There’s a whole life that needs to get looked at here, and they deserve that. I’d like to see more group settings with a combination of psychoeducation, evidence-based research, skills training, and process, because the research says that’s the combination that’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Sallee works for a large HMO psychiatry department, and her account here is not on behalf of, endorsed by, or speaking for any larger organization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The epidemiologist rethinking how to bridge differences in culture and community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Wright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clinician and epidemiologist&lt;br /&gt;Bradford, United Kingdom&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I work in Bradford, the fifth-biggest city in the UK. It has a big South Asian population and high levels of deprivation. Before covid, I’d say there was growing awareness about conspiracies. But during the pandemic, I think that lockdown, isolation, fear of this unknown virus, and then the uncertainty about the future came together in a perfect storm to highlight people’s latent attraction to alternative hypotheses and conspiracies—it was fertile ground. I’ve been a National Health Service doctor for almost 40 years, and until recently, the NHS had a great reputation, with great trust, and great public support. The pandemic was the first time that I started seeing that erode.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just conspiracies about vaccines or new drugs, either—it was also an undermining of trust in public institutions. I remember an older woman who had come into the emergency department with covid. She was very unwell, but she just wouldn’t go into hospital despite all our efforts, because there were conspiracies going around that we were killing patients in hospital. So she went home, and I don’t know what happened to her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other big change in recent years has been social media and social networks that have obviously amplified and accelerated alternative theories and conspiracies. That’s been the tinder that’s allowed the wildfires to spread with these sort of conspiracy theories. In Bradford, particularly among ethnic minority communities, there’s been stronger links between them—allowing this to spread quicker—but also a more structural distrust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic, and we’re seeing lower uptake of the meningitis and HPV vaccines in schools among South Asian families. Ultimately, this needs a bigger societal approach than individual clinicians putting needles in arms. We started a project called Born in Bradford in 2007 that’s following more than 13,000 families, including around 20,000 teenagers as they grow up. One of the biggest focuses for us is how they use social media and how it links to their mental health, so we’re asking them to donate their digital media to us so we can examine it in confidence. We’re hoping it could allow us to explore conspiracies and influences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge for the next generation of resident doctors and clinicians is: How do we encourage health literacy in young people about what’s right and what’s wrong without being paternalistic? We also need to get better at engaging with people as health advocates to counter some of the online narratives. The NHS website can’t compete with how engaging content on TikTok is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The pediatrician who worries about the confusing public narrative on vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Weisz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pediatrician&lt;br /&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m an outpatient pediatrician, so I do a lot of preventative care, checkups, and sick visits, and treating coughs and colds—those sorts of things. I’ve had specific training in how to support families in clinical decision-making related to vaccines, and every family wants what’s best for their child, and so supporting them is part of my job.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t see specific articulation of conspiracy theories, but I do think there’s more questions about vaccines in conversations I’ve not typically had to have before. I’ve found that parents and caregivers do ask general questions about the risks and benefits of vaccines. We just try to reiterate that vaccines have been studied, that they are intentionally scheduled to protect an immature immune system when it’s the most vulnerable, and that we want everyone to be safe, healthy, and strong. That’s how we can provide protection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what’s confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I feel that the narrative in the public space is unfairly confusing to families when over 90% of families still want their kids to be vaccinated. The families who are not as interested in that, or have questions—it typically takes multiple conversations to support that family in their decision-making. It’s very rarely one conversation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think what’s confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated. For example, some of the headlines around recent changes the CDC are making make it sound like they’re making a huge clinical change, when it’s actually not a huge change from what people are typically doing. In my standard clinical practice, we don’t give the combined MMRV vaccine to children under four years old, and that’s been standard practice in all of the places I’ve worked on the Eastern Seaboard. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: In early October, the CDC updated its recommendation that young children receive the varicella vaccine separately from the combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. Many practitioners, including Weisz, already offer the shots separately.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at public surveys, pediatricians are still the most trusted [among health-care providers], and I do live in a jurisdiction with pretty strong policy about school-based vaccination. I think that people are getting information from multiple sources, but at the end of the day, in terms of both the national rates and also what I see in clinical practice, we really are seeing most families wanting vaccines.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;As anyone who has googled their symptoms and convinced themselves that they’ve got a brain tumor will attest, the internet makes it very easy to self-(mis)diagnose your health problems. And although social media and other digital forums can be a lifeline for some people looking for a diagnosis or community, when that information is wrong, it can put their well-being and even lives in danger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this modern impulse to “do your own research” became even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We asked a number of health-care professionals about how this shifting landscape is changing their profession. They told us that they are being forced to adapt how they treat patients. It’s a wide range of experiences: Some say patients tell them they just want more information about certain treatments because they’re concerned about how effective they are. Others hear that their patients just don’t trust the powers that be. Still others say patients are rejecting evidence-based medicine altogether in favor of alternative theories they’ve come across online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are their stories, in their own words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interviews have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The physician trying to set shared goals&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Scales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Internal medicine hospitalist and assistant professor of medicine, &lt;br /&gt;Weill Cornell Medical College&lt;br /&gt;New York City&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every one of my colleagues has stories about patients who have been rejective of care, or had very peculiar perspectives on what their care should be. Sometimes that’s driven by religion. But I think what has changed is people, not necessarily with a religious standpoint, having very fixed beliefs that are sometimes—based on all the evidence that we have—in contradiction with their health goals. And that is a very challenging situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I once treated a patient with a connective tissue disease called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. While there’s no doubt that the illness exists, there’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty over which symptoms can be attributed to Ehlers-Danlos. This means it can fall into what social scientists call a “contested illness.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contested illnesses used to be causes for arguably fringe movements, but they have become much more prominent since the rise of social media in the mid-2010s. Patients often search for information that resonates with their experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This patient was very hesitant about various treatments, and it was clear she was getting her information from, I would say, suspect sources. She’d been following people online who were not necessarily trustworthy, so I sat down with her and we looked them up on Quackwatch, a site that lists health myths and misconduct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She was still accepting of treatment, and was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources and fixed beliefs that overemphasize particular things—like what symptoms might be attributable to other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Physicians have the tools to work with patients who are struggling with these challenges. The first is motivational interviewing, a counseling technique that was developed for people with substance-use disorders. It’s a nonjudgmental approach that uses open-ended questions to draw out people’s motivations, and to find where there’s a mismatch between their behaviors and their beliefs. It’s highly effective in treating people who are vaccine-hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another is an approach called shared decision-making. First we work out what the patient’s goals are and then figure out a way to align those with what we know about the evidence-based way to treat them. It’s something we use for end-of-life care, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s concerning to me is that it seems as though there’s a dynamic of patients coming in with a fixed belief of how to diagnose their illness, how their symptoms should be treated, and how to treat it in a way that’s completely divorced from the kinds of medicine you’d find in textbooks—and that the same dynamic is starting to extend to other illnesses, too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The therapist committed to being there when the conspiracy fever breaks&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damien Stewart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psychologist&lt;br /&gt;Warsaw, Poland&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Before covid, I hadn’t really had any clients bring up conspiracy theories into my practice.

I spoke in a very direct manner he probably wasn’t used to and challenged his conspiracy theory. He got very angry and hung up the call.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It made me figure out how I was going to deal with this in future, and to develop an approach—which was to not challenge the conspiracy theory, but to gently talk through it, to provide alternative points of view and ask questions.

So my anger around these conspiracy theories has changed from being directed toward the deliverer—the person sitting in front of me saying these things—to the people driving the theories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The emergency room doctor trying to get patients to reconnect with the evidence&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Aguilar Montalvan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Attending emergency medicine physician&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Queens, New York&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The emergency department is essentially the pulse of what is happening in society.

I think that could be because we’ve seen a lot of bad actors in medicine, so the power dynamic has changed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think if we had a more unified approach at a national level, if they had an actual unified and transparent relationship with the population, that would set us up right. But I’m not sure we’ve ever had it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127161" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-Healthcare-spot.jpg?w=2047" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The psychologist who supported severely mentally ill patients through the pandemic&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michelle Sallee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psychologist, board certified in serious mental illness psychology&lt;br /&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m a clinical psychologist who only works with people who have been in the hospital three or more times in the last 12 months. I do both individual therapy and a lot of group work, and several years ago during the pandemic, I wrote a 10-week program for patients about how to cope with sheltering in place, following safety guidelines, and their concerns about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My groups were very structured around evidence-based practice, and I had rules for the groups. First, I would tell people that the goal was not to talk them out of their conspiracy theory; my goal was not to talk them into a vaccination. My goal was to provide a safe place for them to be able to talk about things that were terrifying to them. We wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, and the need for psychiatric hospitalizations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Half of the group was pro–public health requirements, and their paranoia and fear for safety was around people who don’t get vaccinated; the other half might have been strongly opposed to anyone other than themselves deciding they need a vaccination or a mask. Both sides were fearing for their lives—but from each other.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure everybody felt heard, and it was really important to be able to talk about what they believed—like, some people felt like the government was trying to track us and even kill us—without any judgment from other people. My theory is that if you allow people to talk freely about what's on their mind without blocking them with your own opinions or judgment, they will find their way eventually. And a lot of times that works.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory or their paranoia has been stuck on it for a long time because they're always fighting with people about it, everyone's telling them that this is not true. So we would just have an open discussion about these things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory for a long time because they're always fighting with people about it, everyone's telling them that this is not true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I ran the program four times for a total of 27 people, and the thing that I remember the most was how respectful and tolerant and empathic, but still honest about their feelings and opinions, everybody was. At the end of the program, most participants reported a decrease in pandemic-related stress. Half reported a decrease in general perceived stress, and half reported no change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d say that the rate of how much vaccines are talked about now is significantly lower, and covid doesn’t really come up anymore. But other medical illnesses come up—patients saying, “My doctor said I need to get this surgery, but I know who they’re working for.” Everybody has their concerns, but when a person with psychosis has concerns, it becomes delusional, paranoid, and psychotic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’d like to see more providers be given more training around severe mental illness. These are not just people who just need to go to the hospital to get remedicated for a couple of days. There’s a whole life that needs to get looked at here, and they deserve that. I’d like to see more group settings with a combination of psychoeducation, evidence-based research, skills training, and process, because the research says that’s the combination that’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Sallee works for a large HMO psychiatry department, and her account here is not on behalf of, endorsed by, or speaking for any larger organization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The epidemiologist rethinking how to bridge differences in culture and community&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Wright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clinician and epidemiologist&lt;br /&gt;Bradford, United Kingdom&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I work in Bradford, the fifth-biggest city in the UK. It has a big South Asian population and high levels of deprivation. Before covid, I’d say there was growing awareness about conspiracies. But during the pandemic, I think that lockdown, isolation, fear of this unknown virus, and then the uncertainty about the future came together in a perfect storm to highlight people’s latent attraction to alternative hypotheses and conspiracies—it was fertile ground. I’ve been a National Health Service doctor for almost 40 years, and until recently, the NHS had a great reputation, with great trust, and great public support. The pandemic was the first time that I started seeing that erode.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just conspiracies about vaccines or new drugs, either—it was also an undermining of trust in public institutions. I remember an older woman who had come into the emergency department with covid. She was very unwell, but she just wouldn’t go into hospital despite all our efforts, because there were conspiracies going around that we were killing patients in hospital. So she went home, and I don’t know what happened to her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other big change in recent years has been social media and social networks that have obviously amplified and accelerated alternative theories and conspiracies. That’s been the tinder that’s allowed the wildfires to spread with these sort of conspiracy theories. In Bradford, particularly among ethnic minority communities, there’s been stronger links between them—allowing this to spread quicker—but also a more structural distrust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic, and we’re seeing lower uptake of the meningitis and HPV vaccines in schools among South Asian families. Ultimately, this needs a bigger societal approach than individual clinicians putting needles in arms. We started a project called Born in Bradford in 2007 that’s following more than 13,000 families, including around 20,000 teenagers as they grow up. One of the biggest focuses for us is how they use social media and how it links to their mental health, so we’re asking them to donate their digital media to us so we can examine it in confidence. We’re hoping it could allow us to explore conspiracies and influences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The challenge for the next generation of resident doctors and clinicians is: How do we encourage health literacy in young people about what’s right and what’s wrong without being paternalistic? We also need to get better at engaging with people as health advocates to counter some of the online narratives. The NHS website can’t compete with how engaging content on TikTok is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The pediatrician who worries about the confusing public narrative on vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Weisz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pediatrician&lt;br /&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/h5&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I’m an outpatient pediatrician, so I do a lot of preventative care, checkups, and sick visits, and treating coughs and colds—those sorts of things. I’ve had specific training in how to support families in clinical decision-making related to vaccines, and every family wants what’s best for their child, and so supporting them is part of my job.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t see specific articulation of conspiracy theories, but I do think there’s more questions about vaccines in conversations I’ve not typically had to have before. I’ve found that parents and caregivers do ask general questions about the risks and benefits of vaccines. We just try to reiterate that vaccines have been studied, that they are intentionally scheduled to protect an immature immune system when it’s the most vulnerable, and that we want everyone to be safe, healthy, and strong. That’s how we can provide protection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft has-text-align-left"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what’s confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I feel that the narrative in the public space is unfairly confusing to families when over 90% of families still want their kids to be vaccinated. The families who are not as interested in that, or have questions—it typically takes multiple conversations to support that family in their decision-making. It’s very rarely one conversation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think what’s confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated. For example, some of the headlines around recent changes the CDC are making make it sound like they’re making a huge clinical change, when it’s actually not a huge change from what people are typically doing. In my standard clinical practice, we don’t give the combined MMRV vaccine to children under four years old, and that’s been standard practice in all of the places I’ve worked on the Eastern Seaboard. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: In early October, the CDC updated its recommendation that young children receive the varicella vaccine separately from the combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. Many practitioners, including Weisz, already offer the shots separately.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at public surveys, pediatricians are still the most trusted [among health-care providers], and I do live in a jurisdiction with pretty strong policy about school-based vaccination. I think that people are getting information from multiple sources, but at the end of the day, in terms of both the national rates and also what I see in clinical practice, we really are seeing most families wanting vaccines.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126464/how-conspiracy-theories-infiltrated-the-doctors-office/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can “The Simpsons” really predict the future?

Earlier, in 1993, an episode of the show featured the “Osaka flu,” which some felt was eerily prescient of the coronavirus pandemic. And—somehow!—&lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; writers &lt;em&gt;just knew&lt;/em&gt; that the US Olympic curling team would beat Sweden eight whole years before they did it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="still frame from The Simpson where Principal Skinner's mother stands next to him on the Olympic podium and leans to heckle the Swedish curling team" class="wp-image-1126706" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SimpsonsThe_BoyMeetsCurl.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After Team USA wins, Principal Skinner's mother gloats to the Swedish curling team, “Tell me how my ice tastes.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;THE SIMPSONS ™ &amp;amp; © 20TH TELEVISION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 16th-century seer Nostradamus made 942 predictions. To date, there have been some 800 episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons.&lt;/em&gt; How does it feel to be a showrunner turned soothsayer? What’s it like when the world combs your jokes for prophecies and thinks you knew about 9/11 four years before it happened?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Al Jean has worked on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; on and off since 1989; he is the cartoon’s longest-serving showrunner. Here, he reflects on the conspiracy theories that have sprung from these apparent prophecies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you first start hearing rumblings about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; having predicted the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It definitely got huge when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 after we “predicted” it in an episode from 2000. The original pitch for the line was Johnny Depp and that was in for a while, but it was decided that it wasn’t as funny as Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What people don’t remember is that in the year 2000, it wasn’t such a crazy name to pick, because Trump was talking about running as a Reform Party candidate. So, like a lot of our “predictions,” it’s an educated guess. I won’t comment on whether it’s a good thing that it happened, but I will say that it’s not the most illogical person you could have picked for that joke. And we did say that following him was Lisa, and now that he’s been elected again, we could still have Lisa next time—that’s my hope!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did it make you feel that people thought you were a prophet?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;apart from the election’s impact on the free world, I would say that we were amused that we had said something that came true. Then we made a short video called “Trumptastic Voyage” in 2015 that predicted he would run in 2016, 2020, 2024, and 2028, so we’re three-quarters of the way through that arduous prediction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_3"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I like people thinking that I know something about the future. It’s a good reputation to have. You only need half a dozen things that were either on target or even uncanny to be considered an oracle. Or maybe we’re from the future—I’ll let you decide!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think people are so drawn to the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is prophetic?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe it slightly satisfies a yearning people have for meaning, certainly when life is now so random.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you say that most of your predictions have logical explanations?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s cherry-picking—there are 35 years of material. How many of the things that we said came true versus how many of the many things we said did not come true?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In 2014, we predicted Germany would win the World Cup in Brazil. It’s because we wanted a joke where the Brazilians were sad and they were singing a sad version of the “Olé, olé” song. So we had to think about who would be likely to win if Brazil lost, and Germany was the number two, so they did win, but it wasn’t the craziest prediction. In the same episode, we predicted that FIFA would be corrupt, which is a very easy prediction! So a lot of them fall under that category.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one scene I wrote, Marge holds a book called &lt;em&gt;Curious George and the Ebola Virus&lt;/em&gt;—people go, “Oh my God! He predicted that!” Well, Ebola existed when I wrote the joke. I’d seen a movie about it called &lt;em&gt;Outbreak&lt;/em&gt;. It’s like predicting the Black Death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But have any of your so-called “predictions” made even you pause?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of really bizarre coincidences. There was a brochure in a New York episode [which aired in 1997] that said “New York, $9” next to a picture of the trade towers looking like an 11. That was nuts. It still sends chills down me. The writer of that episode, Ian Maxtone-Graham, was nonplussed. He really couldn’t believe it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bart Simpson holds some cash in front of a flyer that reads, &amp;quot;NEW YORK $9&amp;quot; with the World Trade Center Towers in the illustration near the 9." class="wp-image-1126708" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SimpsonsThe_TheCityOfNewYorkVsHomerSimpson.jpg?w=2668" width="2668" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;THE SIMPSONS ™ &amp;amp; © 20TH TELEVISION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not like we would’ve made that knowing what was going to come, which we didn’t. And people have advanced conspiracy theories that we’re all Ivy League writers who knew … it’s preposterous stuff that people say. There’s also a thing people do that we don’t really love, which is they fake predictions. So after something happens, they’ll concoct a &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; frame, and it’s not something that ever aired. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: People &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;faked &lt;/em&gt;Simpsons&lt;em&gt; screenshots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; seeming to predict the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse and the 2019 Notre-Dame fire. Images from the real “Osaka flu” episode were also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;edited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; to include the word “coronavirus.”]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that make you feel? Is it frustrating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It shows you how you can really convince people of something that’s not the case. Our small denial doesn’t get as much attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As far as internet conspiracies go, where would you rate the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; can predict the future?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I hope it’s harmless. I think it’s really lodged in the internet very well. I don’t think it’s disappearing anytime soon. I’m sure for the rest of my life I’ll be hearing about what a group of psychics and seers I was part of. If we really could predict that well, we’d all be retired from betting on football. Although, advice to readers: Don’t bet on football.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Homer Simpson wearing a sandwich board that reads &amp;quot;The End is Near&amp;quot; while ringing a bell" class="wp-image-1126707" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SimpsonsThe_ThankGodItsDoomsday1.jpg?w=2668" width="2668" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;THE SIMPSONS ™ &amp;amp; © 20TH TELEVISION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is a tiny part of a trend that is alarming, which is people being unable to distinguish fact from fiction. And I have that trouble too. You read something, and your natural inclination has always been, “Well, I read it—it’s true.” And you have to really be skeptical about that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I ask you to predict a solution to all of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think my only solution is: Look at your phone less and read more books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia Tait is a London-based freelance features journalist who writes about culture, trends, and unusual phenomena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to internet listicles, the animated sitcom &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; has predicted the future anywhere from 17 to 55 times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“As you know, we’ve inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump,” the newly sworn-in President Lisa Simpson declared way back in 2000, 17 years before the real estate mogul was inaugurated as the 45th leader of the United States.

To date, there have been some 800 episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons.&lt;/em&gt; How does it feel to be a showrunner turned soothsayer? What’s it like when the world combs your jokes for prophecies and thinks you knew about 9/11 four years before it happened?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Al Jean has worked on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; on and off since 1989; he is the cartoon’s longest-serving showrunner. Here, he reflects on the conspiracy theories that have sprung from these apparent prophecies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you first start hearing rumblings about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; having predicted the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It definitely got huge when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 after we “predicted” it in an episode from 2000. The original pitch for the line was Johnny Depp and that was in for a while, but it was decided that it wasn’t as funny as Trump.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;What people don’t remember is that in the year 2000, it wasn’t such a crazy name to pick, because Trump was talking about running as a Reform Party candidate. So, like a lot of our “predictions,” it’s an educated guess. I won’t comment on whether it’s a good thing that it happened, but I will say that it’s not the most illogical person you could have picked for that joke. And we did say that following him was Lisa, and now that he’s been elected again, we could still have Lisa next time—that’s my hope!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did it make you feel that people thought you were a prophet?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;apart from the election’s impact on the free world, I would say that we were amused that we had said something that came true. Then we made a short video called “Trumptastic Voyage” in 2015 that predicted he would run in 2016, 2020, 2024, and 2028, so we’re three-quarters of the way through that arduous prediction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 core-embed_3"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I like people thinking that I know something about the future. It’s a good reputation to have. You only need half a dozen things that were either on target or even uncanny to be considered an oracle. Or maybe we’re from the future—I’ll let you decide!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think people are so drawn to the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is prophetic?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe it slightly satisfies a yearning people have for meaning, certainly when life is now so random.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you say that most of your predictions have logical explanations?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s cherry-picking—there are 35 years of material. How many of the things that we said came true versus how many of the many things we said did not come true?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;In 2014, we predicted Germany would win the World Cup in Brazil. It’s because we wanted a joke where the Brazilians were sad and they were singing a sad version of the “Olé, olé” song. So we had to think about who would be likely to win if Brazil lost, and Germany was the number two, so they did win, but it wasn’t the craziest prediction. In the same episode, we predicted that FIFA would be corrupt, which is a very easy prediction! So a lot of them fall under that category.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In one scene I wrote, Marge holds a book called &lt;em&gt;Curious George and the Ebola Virus&lt;/em&gt;—people go, “Oh my God! He predicted that!” Well, Ebola existed when I wrote the joke. I’d seen a movie about it called &lt;em&gt;Outbreak&lt;/em&gt;. It’s like predicting the Black Death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But have any of your so-called “predictions” made even you pause?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of really bizarre coincidences. There was a brochure in a New York episode [which aired in 1997] that said “New York, $9” next to a picture of the trade towers looking like an 11. That was nuts. It still sends chills down me. The writer of that episode, Ian Maxtone-Graham, was nonplussed. He really couldn’t believe it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bart Simpson holds some cash in front of a flyer that reads, &amp;quot;NEW YORK $9&amp;quot; with the World Trade Center Towers in the illustration near the 9." class="wp-image-1126708" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SimpsonsThe_TheCityOfNewYorkVsHomerSimpson.jpg?w=2668" width="2668" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;THE SIMPSONS ™ &amp;amp; © 20TH TELEVISION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not like we would’ve made that knowing what was going to come, which we didn’t. And people have advanced conspiracy theories that we’re all Ivy League writers who knew … it’s preposterous stuff that people say. There’s also a thing people do that we don’t really love, which is they fake predictions. So after something happens, they’ll concoct a &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; frame, and it’s not something that ever aired. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: People &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;faked &lt;/em&gt;Simpsons&lt;em&gt; screenshots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; seeming to predict the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse and the 2019 Notre-Dame fire. Images from the real “Osaka flu” episode were also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;edited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; to include the word “coronavirus.”]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that make you feel? Is it frustrating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It shows you how you can really convince people of something that’s not the case. Our small denial doesn’t get as much attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As far as internet conspiracies go, where would you rate the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; can predict the future?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I hope it’s harmless. I think it’s really lodged in the internet very well. I don’t think it’s disappearing anytime soon. I’m sure for the rest of my life I’ll be hearing about what a group of psychics and seers I was part of. If we really could predict that well, we’d all be retired from betting on football. Although, advice to readers: Don’t bet on football.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Homer Simpson wearing a sandwich board that reads &amp;quot;The End is Near&amp;quot; while ringing a bell" class="wp-image-1126707" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SimpsonsThe_ThankGodItsDoomsday1.jpg?w=2668" width="2668" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;THE SIMPSONS ™ &amp;amp; © 20TH TELEVISION&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is a tiny part of a trend that is alarming, which is people being unable to distinguish fact from fiction. And I have that trouble too. You read something, and your natural inclination has always been, “Well, I read it—it’s true.” And you have to really be skeptical about that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I ask you to predict a solution to all of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think my only solution is: Look at your phone less and read more books.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia Tait is a London-based freelance features journalist who writes about culture, trends, and unusual phenomena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126462/the-simpsons-conspiracy-theories-al-jean/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>It’s never been easier to be a conspiracy theorist (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126457/its-never-been-easier-to-be-a-conspiracy-theorist/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The timing was eerie.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On November 21, 1963, Richard Hofstadter delivered the annual Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University. Hofstadter was a professor of American history at Columbia University who liked to use social psychology to explain political history, the better to defend liberalism from extremism on both sides. His new lecture was titled “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I call it the paranoid style,” he began, “simply because no other word adequately evokes the qualities of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, barely 24 hours later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. This single, shattering event, and subsequent efforts to explain it, popularized a term for something that is clearly the subject of Hofstadter’s talk though it never actually figures in the text: “conspiracy theory.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter’s lecture was later revised into what remains an essential essay, even after decades of scholarship on conspiracy theories, because it lays out, with both rigor and concision, a historical continuity of conspiracist politics. “The paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent,” he writes, tracing the phenomenon back to the early years of the republic. Though each upsurge in conspiracy theories feels alarmingly novel—new narratives disseminated through new technologies on a new scale—they all conform to a similar pattern. As Hofstadter demonstrated, the names may change, but the fundamental template remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His psychological reading of politics has been controversial, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; psychology, rather than economics or other external circumstances, that best explains the flourishing of conspiracy theories. Subsequent research has indeed shown that we are prone to perceive intentionality and patterns where none exist—and that this helps us feel like a person of consequence. To identify and expose a secret plot is to feel heroic and gain the illusion of control over the bewildering mess of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many pioneering theories exposed to the cold light of hindsight, Hofstadter’s has flaws and blind spots. His key oversight was to downplay&amp;nbsp; the paranoid style’s role in mainstream politics up to that point and underrate its potential to spread in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1963, conspiracy theories were still a fringe phenomenon, not because they were inherently unusual but because they had limited reach and were stigmatized by people in power. Now that neither factor holds true, it is obvious how infectious they are. Hofstadter could not, of course, have imagined the information technologies that have become stitched into our lives, nor the fractured media ecosystem of the 21st century, both of which have allowed conspiracist thinking to reach more and more people—to morph, and to bloom like mold. And he could not have predicted that a serial conspiracy theorist would be elected president, twice, and that he would staff his second administration with fellow proponents of the paranoid style.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Hofstadter’s concept of the paranoid style remains useful—and ever relevant—because it also describes a way of &lt;em&gt;reading the world&lt;/em&gt;. As he put it, “The distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies or plots here or there in history, but they regard a ‘vast’ or ‘gigantic’ conspiracy &lt;em&gt;as the motive force&lt;/em&gt; in historical events. History &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost transcendent power, and what is felt to be needed to defeat it is not the usual methods of political give-and-take, but an all-out crusade.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this mystically unified version of history is not just untrue but impossible. It doesn’t make sense on any level. So why has it proved so alluring for so long—and why does it seem to be getting more popular every day?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is a conspiracy theory, anyway?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first person to define the “conspiracy theory” as a widespread phenomenon was the Austrian-British philosopher&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Karl Popper, in his 1948 lecture “Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition.” He was not referring to a theory about an individual conspiracy. He was interested in “the conspiracy theory of society”: a particular way of interpreting the course of events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He later defined it as “the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take an unforeseen catastrophe that inspires fear, anger, and pain—a financial crash, a devastating fire, a terrorist attack, a war. The conventional historian will try to unpick a tangle of different factors, of which malice is only one, and one that may be less significant than dumb luck.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conspiracist, however, will perceive only sinister calculation behind these terrible events—a fiendishly intricate plot conceived and executed to perfection. Intent is everything. Popper’s observation chimes with Hofstadter’s: “The paranoid’s interpretation of history is … distinctly personal: decisive events are not taken as part of the stream of history, but as the consequences of someone’s will.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127210" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9780520276826.jpg?w=666" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Culture of Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Barkun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 2013&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Michael Barkun in the 2003 book &lt;em&gt;A Culture of Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;, the conspiracist interpretation of events rests on three assumptions: Everything is connected, everything is premeditated, and nothing is as it seems. Following that third law means that widely accepted and documented history is, by definition, suspect and alternative explanations, however outré, are more likely to be true. As Hannah Arendt wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Origins of Totalitarianism&lt;/em&gt;, the purpose of conspiracy theories in 20th-century dictatorships “was always to reveal official history as a joke, to demonstrate a sphere of secret influences in which the visible, traceable, and known historical reality was only the outward façade erected explicitly to fool the people.” (Those dictators, of course, were conspirators themselves, projecting their own love of secret plots onto others.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important to remember that “conspiracy theory” can mean different things. Barkun describes three varieties, nesting like Russian dolls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The “event conspiracy theory” concerns a specific, contained catastrophe, such as the Reichstag fire of 1933 or the origins of covid-19. These theories are relatively plausible, even if they can not be proved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The “systemic conspiracy theory” is much more ambitious, purporting to explain numerous events as the poisonous fruit of a clandestine international plot. Far-fetched though they are, they do at least fixate on named groups, whether the Illuminati or the World Economic Forum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is increasingly clear that “conspiracy &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;” is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the “superconspiracy theory” is that impossible fantasy in which history itself is a conspiracy, orchestrated by unseen forces of almost supernatural power and malevolence. The most extreme variants of QAnon posit such a universal conspiracy. It seeks to encompass and explain nothing less than the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are very different genres of storytelling. If the first resembles a detective story, then the other two are more akin to fables. Yet one can morph into the other. Take the theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The first wave of amateur investigators created event conspiracy theories—relatively self-contained plots with credible assassins such as Cubans or the Mafia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But over time, event conspiracy theories have come to seem parochial. By the time of Oliver Stone’s 1991 movie &lt;em&gt;JFK&lt;/em&gt;, once-popular plots had been eclipsed by elaborate fictions of gigantic long-running conspiracies in which the murder of the president was just one component. One of Stone’s primary sources was the journalist Jim Marrs, who went on to write books about the Freemasons and UFOs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why limit yourself to a laboriously researched hypothesis about a single event when one giant, dramatic plot can explain them all?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The theory of everything&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In every systemic or superconspiracy theory, the world is corrupt and unjust and getting worse. An elite cabal of improbably powerful individuals, motivated by pure malignancy, is responsible for most of humanity’s misfortunes. Only through the revelation of hidden knowledge and the cracking of codes by a righteous minority can the malefactors be unmasked and defeated. The morality is as simplistic as the narrative is complex: It is a battle between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notice anything? This is not the language of democratic politics but that of myth and of religion. In fact, it is the fundamental message of the Book of Revelation. Conspiracist thinking can be seen as an offshoot, often but not always secularized, of apocalyptic Christianity, with its alluring web of prophecies, signs, and secrets and its promise of violent resolution. After studying several millenarian sects for his 1957 book &lt;em&gt;The Pursuit of the Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, the historian Norman Cohn itemized some common traits, among them “the megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect, wholly good, abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph; the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers to the adversary; the refusal to accept the ineluctable limitations and imperfections of human experience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Popper similarly considered the conspiracy theory of society “a typical result of the secularization of religious superstition,” adding: “The gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups … whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;QAnon’s mutation from a conspiracy theory on an internet message board into a movement with the characteristics of a cult makes explicit the kinship between conspiracy theories and apocalyptic religion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This way of thinking facilitates the creation of dehumanized scapegoats—one of the oldest and most consistent features of a conspiracy theory. During the Middle Ages and beyond, political and religious leaders routinely flung the name “Antichrist” at their opponents. During the Crusades, Christians falsely accused Europe’s Jewish communities of collaborating with Islam or poisoning wells and put them to the sword. Witch-hunters implicated tens of thousands of innocent women in a supposed satanic conspiracy that was said to explain everything from illness to crop failure. “Conspiracy theories are, in the end, not so much an explanation of events as they are an effort to assign blame,” writes Anna Merlan in the 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Republic of Lies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Republic of Lies" class="wp-image-1127232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Republic-of-Lies.jpg?w=1274" width="1274" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Merlan&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;METROPOLITAN PUBLISHERS, 2019&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the systemic conspiracy theory as we know it—that is, the ostensibly secular variety—was established three centuries later, with remarkable speed. Some horrified opponents of the French Revolution could not accept that such an upheaval could be simply a popular revolt and needed to attribute it to sinister, unseen forces. They settled on the Illuminati, a Bavarian secret society of Enlightenment intellectuals influenced in part by the rituals and hierarchy of Freemasonry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The group was founded by a young law professor named Adam Weishaupt, who used the alias Brother Spartacus. In reality, the Illuminati were few in number, fractious, powerless, and, by the time of the revolution in 1789, defunct. But in the imaginations of two influential writers who published “exposés” of the Illuminati in 1797—Scotland’s John Robison and France’s Augustin Barruel—they were everywhere. Each man erected a wobbling tower of wild supposition and feverish nonsense on a platform of plausible claims and verifiable facts. Robison alleged that the revolution was merely part of “one great and wicked project” whose ultimate aim was to “abolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Illuminati’s bogeyman status faded during the 19th century, but the core narrative persisted and proceeded to underpin the notorious hoax &lt;em&gt;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&lt;/em&gt;, first published in a Russian newspaper in 1903. The document’s anonymous author reinvented antisemitism by grafting it onto the story of the one big plot and positing Jews as the secret rulers of the world. In this account, the Elders orchestrate every war, recession, and so on in order to destabilize the world to the point where they can impose tyranny.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might ask why, if they have such world-bending power already, they would require a dictatorship. You might also wonder how one group could be responsible for both communism and monopoly capitalism, anarchism and democracy, the theory of evolution, and much more besides. But the vast, self-contradicting incoherence of the plot is what made it impossible to disprove. Nothing was ruled out, so every development could potentially be taken as evidence of the Elders at work.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 1921, the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; were exposed as what the London&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;called a “clumsy forgery,” plagiarized from two obscure 19th-century novels, yet they remained the key text of European antisemitism—essentially “true” despite being demonstrably false. “I believe in the inner, but not the factual, truth of the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt;,” said Joseph Goebbels, who would become Hitler’s minister of propaganda. In &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;, Hitler claimed that efforts to debunk the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; were actually “evidence in favor of their authenticity.” He alleged that Jews, if not stopped, would “one day devour the other nations and become lords of the earth.” Popper and Hofstadter both used the Holocaust as an example of what happens when a conspiracy theorist gains power and makes the paranoid style a governing principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="esoteric symbols and figures on torn paper including a witchfinder, George Washington and a Civil war era solder" class="wp-image-1127235" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01-usa-freemason-zion.jpg?w=1309" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prominent role of Jewish Bolsheviks like Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Russian Revolution of 1917 enabled a merger of antisemitism and anticommunism that survived the fascist era. Cold War red-baiters such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society assigned to communists uncanny degrees of malice and ubiquity, far beyond the real threat of Soviet espionage. In fact, they presented this view as the only logical one. McCarthy claimed that a string of national security setbacks could be explained only if George C. Marshall, the secretary of defense and former secretary of state,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was literally a Soviet agent. “How can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster?” he asked in 1951. “This must be the product of a great conspiracy so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This continuity between antisemitism, anticommunism, and 18th-century paranoia about secret societies isn’t hard to see. General Francisco Franco, Spain’s right-wing dictator, claimed to be fighting a “Judeo-Masonic-Bolshevik” conspiracy. The Nazis persecuted Freemasons alongside Jews and communists. Nesta Webster, the British fascist sympathizer who laundered the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; through the British press, revived interest in Robison and Barruel’s books about the Illuminati, which the pro-Nazi Baptist preacher Gerald Winrod then promoted in the US. Even Winston Churchill was briefly persuaded by Webster’s work, citing it in his claims of a “world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization … from the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to the days of Karl Marx.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To follow the chain further, Webster and Winrod’s stew of anticommunism, antisemitism, and anti-Illuminati conspiracy theories influenced the John Birch Society, whose publications would light a fire decades later under the Infowars founder Alex Jones, perhaps the most consequential conspiracy theorist of the early 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The villains behind the one big plot might be the Illuminati, the Elders of Zion, the communists, or the New World Order, but they are always essentially the same people, aspiring to officially dominate a world that they already secretly control. The names can be swapped around without much difficulty. While Winrod maintained that “the real conspirators behind the Illuminati were Jews,” the anticommunist William Guy Carr conversely argued that antisemitic paranoia “plays right into the hands of the Illuminati.” These days, it might be the World Economic Forum or George Soros; liberal internationalists with aspirations to change the world are easily cast as the new Illuminati, working toward establishing one world government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Finding connection&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main reason that conspiracy theorists have lost interest in the relatively hard work of micro-conspiracies in favor of grander schemes is that it has become much easier to draw lines between objectively unrelated people and events. Information technology is, after all, also misinformation technology. That’s nothing new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The witch craze could not have traveled as far or lasted as long without the printing press. &lt;em&gt;Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches&lt;/em&gt;), a 1486 screed by the German witch-hunter Heinrich Kramer, became the best-selling witch-hunter’s handbook, going through 28 editions by 1600. Similarly, it was the books and pamphlets “exposing” the Illuminati that allowed those ideas to spread everywhere following the French Revolution. And in the early 20th century, the introduction of the radio facilitated fascist propaganda. During the 1930s, the Nazi-sympathizing Catholic priest and radio host Charles Coughlin broadcast his antisemitic conspiracy theories to tens of millions of Americans on dozens of stations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The internet has, of course, vastly accelerated and magnified the spread of conspiracy theories. It is hard to recall now, but in the early days it was sweetly assumed that the internet would improve the world by democratizing access to information. While this initial idealism survives in doughty enclaves such as Wikipedia, most of us vastly underestimated the human appetite for false information that confirms the consumer’s biases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Politicians, too, were slow to recognize the corrosive power of free-flowing conspiracy theories. For a long time, the more fantastical assertions of McCarthy and the Birchers were kept at arm’s length from the political mainstream, but that distance began to diminish rapidly during the 1990s, as right-wing activists built a cottage industry of outrageous claims about Bill and Hillary Clinton to advance the idea that they were not just corrupt or dishonest but actively evil and even satanic. This became an article of faith in the information ecosystem of internet message boards and talk radio, which expanded over time to include Fox News, blogs, and social media. So when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016, a significant portion of the American public saw a monster at the heart of an organized crime ring whose activities included human trafficking and murder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody could make the same mistake about misinformation today. One could hardly design a more fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories than social media. The algorithms of YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and X, which operate on the principle that rage is engaging, have turned into radicalization machines. When these platforms took off during the second half of the 2010s, they offered a seamless system in which people were able to come across exciting new information, share it, connect it to other strands of misinformation, and weave them into self-contained, self-affirming communities, all without leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see how the problem will continue to grow as AI burrows ever deeper into our everyday lives. Elon Musk has tinkered with the AI chatbot Grok to produce information that conforms to his personal beliefs rather than to actual facts. This outcome does not even have to be intentional. Chatbots have been shown to validate and intensify some users’ beliefs, even if they’re rooted in paranoia or hubris. If you believe that you’re the hero in an epic battle between good and evil, then your chatbot is inclined to agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all this digital noise that has brought about the virtual collapse of the event conspiracy theory. The industry produced by the JFK assassination may have been pseudo-scholarship, but at least researchers went through the motions of scrutinizing documents, gathering evidence, and putting forward a somewhat consistent hypothesis. However misguided the conclusions, that kind of conspiracy theory required hard work and commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Commuters reading of John F. Kennedy's assassination in the newspaper" class="wp-image-1127229" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_shutterstock_editorial_12064011b.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CARL MYDANS/THE LIFE PICTURE COLLECTION/SHUTTERSTOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today’s online conspiracy theorists, by contrast, are shamelessly sloppy. Events such as the attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in October 2022, or the murders of Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in June 2025, or even more recently the killing of Charlie Kirk, have inspired theories overnight, which then evaporate just as quickly. The point of such theories, if they even merit that label, is not to seek the truth but to defame political opponents and turn victims into villains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before he even ran for office, Trump was notorious for promoting false stories about Barack Obama’s birthplace or vaccine safety. Heir to Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater, and the John Birch Society, he is the lurid incarnation of the paranoid style. He routinely damns his opponents as “evil” or “very bad people” and speaks of America’s future in apocalyptic terms. It is no surprise, then, that every member of the administration must subscribe to Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, or that celebrity conspiracy theorists are now in charge of national intelligence, public health, and the FBI. Former Democrats who hold such roles, like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have entered Trump’s orbit through the gateway of conspiracy theories. They illustrate how this mindset can create counterintuitive alliances that collapse conventional political distinctions and scramble traditional notions of right and left.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The antidemocratic implications of what’s happening today are obvious. “Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to the finish,” Hofstadter wrote. “Nothing but complete victory will do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Meeting the moment&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to feel helpless in the face of this epistemic chaos. Because one other foundational feature of religious prophecy is that it can be disproved without being discredited: Perhaps the world does not come to an end on the predicted day, but that great day will still come. The prophet is never wrong—he is just not proven right &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same flexibility is enjoyed by systemic conspiracy theories. The plotters never actually succeed, nor are they ever decisively exposed, yet the theory remains intact. Recently, claims that covid-19 was either exaggerated or wholly fabricated in order to crush civil liberties did not wither away once lockdown restrictions were lifted. Surely the so-called “plandemic” was a complete disaster? No matter. This type of conspiracy theory does not have to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scholars who have attempted to methodically repudiate conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks or the JFK assassination have found that even once all the supporting pillars have been knocked away, the edifice still stands. It is increasingly clear that “conspiracy &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;” is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;—as Hofstadter suggested, a worldview buttressed with numerous cognitive biases and impregnable to refutation. As Goebbels implied, the “factual truth” pales in comparison to the “inner truth,” which is whatever somebody believes it be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at the very least, what we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is identify the entirely different realities constructed by believers and recognize and internalize their common roots, tropes, and motives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those different realities, after all, have proved remarkably consistent in shape if not in their details. What we saw then, we see now. The Illuminati were Enlightenment idealists whose liberal agenda to “dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice,” in Weishaupt’s words, was demonized as wicked and destructive. If they could be shown to have fomented the French Revolution, then the whole revolution was a sham. Similarly, today’s radical right recasts every plank of progressive politics as an anti-American conspiracy. The far-right Great Replacement Theory, for instance, posits that immigration policy is a calculated effort by elites to supplant the native population with outsiders. This all flows directly from what thinkers such as Hofstadter, Popper, and Arendt diagnosed more than 60 years ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerously novel, at least in democracies, is conspiracy theories’ ubiquity, reach, and power to affect the lives of ordinary citizens. So understanding the paranoid style better equips us to counteract it in our daily existence. At minimum, this knowledge empowers us to spot the flaws and biases in our own thinking and stop ourselves from tumbling down dangerous rabbit holes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of book" class="wp-image-1127240" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-paranoid-style-in-American-politics-And-other-essays.jpg?w=203" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Hofstadter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VINTAGE BOOKS, 1967&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On November 18, 1961, President Kennedy—almost exactly two years before Hofstadter’s lecture and his own assassination—offered his own definition of the paranoid style in a speech to the Democratic Party of California. “There have always been those on the fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat,” he said. “At times these fanatics have achieved a temporary success among those who lack the will or the wisdom to face unpleasant facts or unsolved problems. But in time the basic good sense and stability of the great American consensus has always prevailed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can only hope that the consensus begins to see the rolling chaos and naked aggression of Trump’s two administrations as weighty evidence &lt;em&gt;against &lt;/em&gt;the conspiracy theory of society. The notion that any group could successfully direct the larger mess of this moment in the world, let alone the course of history for decades, undetected, is palpably absurd. The important thing is not that the details of this or that conspiracy theory are wrong; it is that the entire premise behind this worldview is false.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not everything is connected, not everything is premeditated, and many things are in fact just as they seem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dorian Lynskey is the author of several books, including &lt;/em&gt;The Ministry of Truth: The Biography of George Orwell’s 1984&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World&lt;em&gt;.

Hofstadter was a professor of American history at Columbia University who liked to use social psychology to explain political history, the better to defend liberalism from extremism on both sides. His new lecture was titled “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I call it the paranoid style,” he began, “simply because no other word adequately evokes the qualities of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, barely 24 hours later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. This single, shattering event, and subsequent efforts to explain it, popularized a term for something that is clearly the subject of Hofstadter’s talk though it never actually figures in the text: “conspiracy theory.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter’s lecture was later revised into what remains an essential essay, even after decades of scholarship on conspiracy theories, because it lays out, with both rigor and concision, a historical continuity of conspiracist politics. “The paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent,” he writes, tracing the phenomenon back to the early years of the republic. Though each upsurge in conspiracy theories feels alarmingly novel—new narratives disseminated through new technologies on a new scale—they all conform to a similar pattern. As Hofstadter demonstrated, the names may change, but the fundamental template remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His psychological reading of politics has been controversial, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; psychology, rather than economics or other external circumstances, that best explains the flourishing of conspiracy theories. Subsequent research has indeed shown that we are prone to perceive intentionality and patterns where none exist—and that this helps us feel like a person of consequence. To identify and expose a secret plot is to feel heroic and gain the illusion of control over the bewildering mess of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many pioneering theories exposed to the cold light of hindsight, Hofstadter’s has flaws and blind spots. His key oversight was to downplay&amp;nbsp; the paranoid style’s role in mainstream politics up to that point and underrate its potential to spread in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1963, conspiracy theories were still a fringe phenomenon, not because they were inherently unusual but because they had limited reach and were stigmatized by people in power. Now that neither factor holds true, it is obvious how infectious they are. Hofstadter could not, of course, have imagined the information technologies that have become stitched into our lives, nor the fractured media ecosystem of the 21st century, both of which have allowed conspiracist thinking to reach more and more people—to morph, and to bloom like mold. And he could not have predicted that a serial conspiracy theorist would be elected president, twice, and that he would staff his second administration with fellow proponents of the paranoid style.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But Hofstadter’s concept of the paranoid style remains useful—and ever relevant—because it also describes a way of &lt;em&gt;reading the world&lt;/em&gt;. As he put it, “The distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies or plots here or there in history, but they regard a ‘vast’ or ‘gigantic’ conspiracy &lt;em&gt;as the motive force&lt;/em&gt; in historical events. History &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost transcendent power, and what is felt to be needed to defeat it is not the usual methods of political give-and-take, but an all-out crusade.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this mystically unified version of history is not just untrue but impossible. It doesn’t make sense on any level. So why has it proved so alluring for so long—and why does it seem to be getting more popular every day?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is a conspiracy theory, anyway?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first person to define the “conspiracy theory” as a widespread phenomenon was the Austrian-British philosopher&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Karl Popper, in his 1948 lecture “Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition.” He was not referring to a theory about an individual conspiracy. He was interested in “the conspiracy theory of society”: a particular way of interpreting the course of events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He later defined it as “the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take an unforeseen catastrophe that inspires fear, anger, and pain—a financial crash, a devastating fire, a terrorist attack, a war. The conventional historian will try to unpick a tangle of different factors, of which malice is only one, and one that may be less significant than dumb luck.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The conspiracist, however, will perceive only sinister calculation behind these terrible events—a fiendishly intricate plot conceived and executed to perfection. Intent is everything. Popper’s observation chimes with Hofstadter’s: “The paranoid’s interpretation of history is … distinctly personal: decisive events are not taken as part of the stream of history, but as the consequences of someone’s will.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127210" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9780520276826.jpg?w=666" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Culture of Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Barkun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 2013&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Michael Barkun in the 2003 book &lt;em&gt;A Culture of Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt;, the conspiracist interpretation of events rests on three assumptions: Everything is connected, everything is premeditated, and nothing is as it seems. Following that third law means that widely accepted and documented history is, by definition, suspect and alternative explanations, however outré, are more likely to be true. As Hannah Arendt wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Origins of Totalitarianism&lt;/em&gt;, the purpose of conspiracy theories in 20th-century dictatorships “was always to reveal official history as a joke, to demonstrate a sphere of secret influences in which the visible, traceable, and known historical reality was only the outward façade erected explicitly to fool the people.” (Those dictators, of course, were conspirators themselves, projecting their own love of secret plots onto others.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it’s important to remember that “conspiracy theory” can mean different things. Barkun describes three varieties, nesting like Russian dolls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The “event conspiracy theory” concerns a specific, contained catastrophe, such as the Reichstag fire of 1933 or the origins of covid-19. These theories are relatively plausible, even if they can not be proved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The “systemic conspiracy theory” is much more ambitious, purporting to explain numerous events as the poisonous fruit of a clandestine international plot. Far-fetched though they are, they do at least fixate on named groups, whether the Illuminati or the World Economic Forum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is increasingly clear that “conspiracy &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;” is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the “superconspiracy theory” is that impossible fantasy in which history itself is a conspiracy, orchestrated by unseen forces of almost supernatural power and malevolence. The most extreme variants of QAnon posit such a universal conspiracy. It seeks to encompass and explain nothing less than the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are very different genres of storytelling. If the first resembles a detective story, then the other two are more akin to fables. Yet one can morph into the other. Take the theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The first wave of amateur investigators created event conspiracy theories—relatively self-contained plots with credible assassins such as Cubans or the Mafia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But over time, event conspiracy theories have come to seem parochial. By the time of Oliver Stone’s 1991 movie &lt;em&gt;JFK&lt;/em&gt;, once-popular plots had been eclipsed by elaborate fictions of gigantic long-running conspiracies in which the murder of the president was just one component. One of Stone’s primary sources was the journalist Jim Marrs, who went on to write books about the Freemasons and UFOs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why limit yourself to a laboriously researched hypothesis about a single event when one giant, dramatic plot can explain them all?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The theory of everything&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In every systemic or superconspiracy theory, the world is corrupt and unjust and getting worse. An elite cabal of improbably powerful individuals, motivated by pure malignancy, is responsible for most of humanity’s misfortunes. Only through the revelation of hidden knowledge and the cracking of codes by a righteous minority can the malefactors be unmasked and defeated. The morality is as simplistic as the narrative is complex: It is a battle between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notice anything? This is not the language of democratic politics but that of myth and of religion. In fact, it is the fundamental message of the Book of Revelation. Conspiracist thinking can be seen as an offshoot, often but not always secularized, of apocalyptic Christianity, with its alluring web of prophecies, signs, and secrets and its promise of violent resolution. After studying several millenarian sects for his 1957 book &lt;em&gt;The Pursuit of the Millennium&lt;/em&gt;, the historian Norman Cohn itemized some common traits, among them “the megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect, wholly good, abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph; the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers to the adversary; the refusal to accept the ineluctable limitations and imperfections of human experience.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Popper similarly considered the conspiracy theory of society “a typical result of the secularization of religious superstition,” adding: “The gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups … whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;QAnon’s mutation from a conspiracy theory on an internet message board into a movement with the characteristics of a cult makes explicit the kinship between conspiracy theories and apocalyptic religion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This way of thinking facilitates the creation of dehumanized scapegoats—one of the oldest and most consistent features of a conspiracy theory. During the Middle Ages and beyond, political and religious leaders routinely flung the name “Antichrist” at their opponents. During the Crusades, Christians falsely accused Europe’s Jewish communities of collaborating with Islam or poisoning wells and put them to the sword. Witch-hunters implicated tens of thousands of innocent women in a supposed satanic conspiracy that was said to explain everything from illness to crop failure. “Conspiracy theories are, in the end, not so much an explanation of events as they are an effort to assign blame,” writes Anna Merlan in the 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Republic of Lies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of Republic of Lies" class="wp-image-1127232" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Republic-of-Lies.jpg?w=1274" width="1274" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Merlan&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;METROPOLITAN PUBLISHERS, 2019&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the systemic conspiracy theory as we know it—that is, the ostensibly secular variety—was established three centuries later, with remarkable speed. Some horrified opponents of the French Revolution could not accept that such an upheaval could be simply a popular revolt and needed to attribute it to sinister, unseen forces. They settled on the Illuminati, a Bavarian secret society of Enlightenment intellectuals influenced in part by the rituals and hierarchy of Freemasonry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The group was founded by a young law professor named Adam Weishaupt, who used the alias Brother Spartacus. In reality, the Illuminati were few in number, fractious, powerless, and, by the time of the revolution in 1789, defunct. But in the imaginations of two influential writers who published “exposés” of the Illuminati in 1797—Scotland’s John Robison and France’s Augustin Barruel—they were everywhere. Each man erected a wobbling tower of wild supposition and feverish nonsense on a platform of plausible claims and verifiable facts. Robison alleged that the revolution was merely part of “one great and wicked project” whose ultimate aim was to “abolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Illuminati’s bogeyman status faded during the 19th century, but the core narrative persisted and proceeded to underpin the notorious hoax &lt;em&gt;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&lt;/em&gt;, first published in a Russian newspaper in 1903. The document’s anonymous author reinvented antisemitism by grafting it onto the story of the one big plot and positing Jews as the secret rulers of the world. In this account, the Elders orchestrate every war, recession, and so on in order to destabilize the world to the point where they can impose tyranny.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might ask why, if they have such world-bending power already, they would require a dictatorship. You might also wonder how one group could be responsible for both communism and monopoly capitalism, anarchism and democracy, the theory of evolution, and much more besides. But the vast, self-contradicting incoherence of the plot is what made it impossible to disprove. Nothing was ruled out, so every development could potentially be taken as evidence of the Elders at work.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In 1921, the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; were exposed as what the London&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;called a “clumsy forgery,” plagiarized from two obscure 19th-century novels, yet they remained the key text of European antisemitism—essentially “true” despite being demonstrably false. “I believe in the inner, but not the factual, truth of the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt;,” said Joseph Goebbels, who would become Hitler’s minister of propaganda. In &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;, Hitler claimed that efforts to debunk the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; were actually “evidence in favor of their authenticity.” He alleged that Jews, if not stopped, would “one day devour the other nations and become lords of the earth.” Popper and Hofstadter both used the Holocaust as an example of what happens when a conspiracy theorist gains power and makes the paranoid style a governing principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="esoteric symbols and figures on torn paper including a witchfinder, George Washington and a Civil war era solder" class="wp-image-1127235" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01-usa-freemason-zion.jpg?w=1309" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prominent role of Jewish Bolsheviks like Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Russian Revolution of 1917 enabled a merger of antisemitism and anticommunism that survived the fascist era. Cold War red-baiters such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society assigned to communists uncanny degrees of malice and ubiquity, far beyond the real threat of Soviet espionage. In fact, they presented this view as the only logical one. McCarthy claimed that a string of national security setbacks could be explained only if George C. Marshall, the secretary of defense and former secretary of state,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was literally a Soviet agent. “How can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster?” he asked in 1951. “This must be the product of a great conspiracy so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This continuity between antisemitism, anticommunism, and 18th-century paranoia about secret societies isn’t hard to see. General Francisco Franco, Spain’s right-wing dictator, claimed to be fighting a “Judeo-Masonic-Bolshevik” conspiracy. The Nazis persecuted Freemasons alongside Jews and communists. Nesta Webster, the British fascist sympathizer who laundered the &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; through the British press, revived interest in Robison and Barruel’s books about the Illuminati, which the pro-Nazi Baptist preacher Gerald Winrod then promoted in the US. Even Winston Churchill was briefly persuaded by Webster’s work, citing it in his claims of a “world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization … from the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to the days of Karl Marx.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To follow the chain further, Webster and Winrod’s stew of anticommunism, antisemitism, and anti-Illuminati conspiracy theories influenced the John Birch Society, whose publications would light a fire decades later under the Infowars founder Alex Jones, perhaps the most consequential conspiracy theorist of the early 21st century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The villains behind the one big plot might be the Illuminati, the Elders of Zion, the communists, or the New World Order, but they are always essentially the same people, aspiring to officially dominate a world that they already secretly control. The names can be swapped around without much difficulty. While Winrod maintained that “the real conspirators behind the Illuminati were Jews,” the anticommunist William Guy Carr conversely argued that antisemitic paranoia “plays right into the hands of the Illuminati.” These days, it might be the World Economic Forum or George Soros; liberal internationalists with aspirations to change the world are easily cast as the new Illuminati, working toward establishing one world government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Finding connection&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main reason that conspiracy theorists have lost interest in the relatively hard work of micro-conspiracies in favor of grander schemes is that it has become much easier to draw lines between objectively unrelated people and events. Information technology is, after all, also misinformation technology. That’s nothing new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The witch craze could not have traveled as far or lasted as long without the printing press. &lt;em&gt;Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches&lt;/em&gt;), a 1486 screed by the German witch-hunter Heinrich Kramer, became the best-selling witch-hunter’s handbook, going through 28 editions by 1600. Similarly, it was the books and pamphlets “exposing” the Illuminati that allowed those ideas to spread everywhere following the French Revolution. And in the early 20th century, the introduction of the radio facilitated fascist propaganda. During the 1930s, the Nazi-sympathizing Catholic priest and radio host Charles Coughlin broadcast his antisemitic conspiracy theories to tens of millions of Americans on dozens of stations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The internet has, of course, vastly accelerated and magnified the spread of conspiracy theories. It is hard to recall now, but in the early days it was sweetly assumed that the internet would improve the world by democratizing access to information. While this initial idealism survives in doughty enclaves such as Wikipedia, most of us vastly underestimated the human appetite for false information that confirms the consumer’s biases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Politicians, too, were slow to recognize the corrosive power of free-flowing conspiracy theories. For a long time, the more fantastical assertions of McCarthy and the Birchers were kept at arm’s length from the political mainstream, but that distance began to diminish rapidly during the 1990s, as right-wing activists built a cottage industry of outrageous claims about Bill and Hillary Clinton to advance the idea that they were not just corrupt or dishonest but actively evil and even satanic. This became an article of faith in the information ecosystem of internet message boards and talk radio, which expanded over time to include Fox News, blogs, and social media. So when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016, a significant portion of the American public saw a monster at the heart of an organized crime ring whose activities included human trafficking and murder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody could make the same mistake about misinformation today. One could hardly design a more fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories than social media. The algorithms of YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and X, which operate on the principle that rage is engaging, have turned into radicalization machines. When these platforms took off during the second half of the 2010s, they offered a seamless system in which people were able to come across exciting new information, share it, connect it to other strands of misinformation, and weave them into self-contained, self-affirming communities, all without leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see how the problem will continue to grow as AI burrows ever deeper into our everyday lives. Elon Musk has tinkered with the AI chatbot Grok to produce information that conforms to his personal beliefs rather than to actual facts. This outcome does not even have to be intentional. Chatbots have been shown to validate and intensify some users’ beliefs, even if they’re rooted in paranoia or hubris. If you believe that you’re the hero in an epic battle between good and evil, then your chatbot is inclined to agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s all this digital noise that has brought about the virtual collapse of the event conspiracy theory. The industry produced by the JFK assassination may have been pseudo-scholarship, but at least researchers went through the motions of scrutinizing documents, gathering evidence, and putting forward a somewhat consistent hypothesis. However misguided the conclusions, that kind of conspiracy theory required hard work and commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Commuters reading of John F. Kennedy's assassination in the newspaper" class="wp-image-1127229" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_shutterstock_editorial_12064011b.jpg?w=3000" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;CARL MYDANS/THE LIFE PICTURE COLLECTION/SHUTTERSTOCK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today’s online conspiracy theorists, by contrast, are shamelessly sloppy. Events such as the attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in October 2022, or the murders of Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in June 2025, or even more recently the killing of Charlie Kirk, have inspired theories overnight, which then evaporate just as quickly. The point of such theories, if they even merit that label, is not to seek the truth but to defame political opponents and turn victims into villains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before he even ran for office, Trump was notorious for promoting false stories about Barack Obama’s birthplace or vaccine safety. Heir to Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater, and the John Birch Society, he is the lurid incarnation of the paranoid style. He routinely damns his opponents as “evil” or “very bad people” and speaks of America’s future in apocalyptic terms. It is no surprise, then, that every member of the administration must subscribe to Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, or that celebrity conspiracy theorists are now in charge of national intelligence, public health, and the FBI. Former Democrats who hold such roles, like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have entered Trump’s orbit through the gateway of conspiracy theories. They illustrate how this mindset can create counterintuitive alliances that collapse conventional political distinctions and scramble traditional notions of right and left.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The antidemocratic implications of what’s happening today are obvious. “Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to the finish,” Hofstadter wrote. “Nothing but complete victory will do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Meeting the moment&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to feel helpless in the face of this epistemic chaos. Because one other foundational feature of religious prophecy is that it can be disproved without being discredited: Perhaps the world does not come to an end on the predicted day, but that great day will still come. The prophet is never wrong—he is just not proven right &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same flexibility is enjoyed by systemic conspiracy theories. The plotters never actually succeed, nor are they ever decisively exposed, yet the theory remains intact. Recently, claims that covid-19 was either exaggerated or wholly fabricated in order to crush civil liberties did not wither away once lockdown restrictions were lifted. Surely the so-called “plandemic” was a complete disaster? No matter. This type of conspiracy theory does not have to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scholars who have attempted to methodically repudiate conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks or the JFK assassination have found that even once all the supporting pillars have been knocked away, the edifice still stands. It is increasingly clear that “conspiracy &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;” is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;—as Hofstadter suggested, a worldview buttressed with numerous cognitive biases and impregnable to refutation. As Goebbels implied, the “factual truth” pales in comparison to the “inner truth,” which is whatever somebody believes it be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at the very least, what we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is identify the entirely different realities constructed by believers and recognize and internalize their common roots, tropes, and motives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those different realities, after all, have proved remarkably consistent in shape if not in their details. What we saw then, we see now. The Illuminati were Enlightenment idealists whose liberal agenda to “dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice,” in Weishaupt’s words, was demonized as wicked and destructive. If they could be shown to have fomented the French Revolution, then the whole revolution was a sham. Similarly, today’s radical right recasts every plank of progressive politics as an anti-American conspiracy. The far-right Great Replacement Theory, for instance, posits that immigration policy is a calculated effort by elites to supplant the native population with outsiders. This all flows directly from what thinkers such as Hofstadter, Popper, and Arendt diagnosed more than 60 years ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerously novel, at least in democracies, is conspiracy theories’ ubiquity, reach, and power to affect the lives of ordinary citizens. So understanding the paranoid style better equips us to counteract it in our daily existence. At minimum, this knowledge empowers us to spot the flaws and biases in our own thinking and stop ourselves from tumbling down dangerous rabbit holes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="cover of book" class="wp-image-1127240" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-paranoid-style-in-American-politics-And-other-essays.jpg?w=203" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Hofstadter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;VINTAGE BOOKS, 1967&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On November 18, 1961, President Kennedy—almost exactly two years before Hofstadter’s lecture and his own assassination—offered his own definition of the paranoid style in a speech to the Democratic Party of California. “There have always been those on the fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat,” he said. “At times these fanatics have achieved a temporary success among those who lack the will or the wisdom to face unpleasant facts or unsolved problems. But in time the basic good sense and stability of the great American consensus has always prevailed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can only hope that the consensus begins to see the rolling chaos and naked aggression of Trump’s two administrations as weighty evidence &lt;em&gt;against &lt;/em&gt;the conspiracy theory of society. The notion that any group could successfully direct the larger mess of this moment in the world, let alone the course of history for decades, undetected, is palpably absurd. The important thing is not that the details of this or that conspiracy theory are wrong; it is that the entire premise behind this worldview is false.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not everything is connected, not everything is premeditated, and many things are in fact just as they seem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dorian Lynskey is the author of several books, including &lt;/em&gt;The Ministry of Truth: The Biography of George Orwell’s 1984&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World&lt;em&gt;.

Or the day when Heaven’s Gaters imagined they’d be picked up by a UFO and transformed into enlightened aliens. Or the moment when Donald Trump finally decides to deliver the storm that Q promised. But no. We’re of course talking about artificial general intelligence, or AGI—that hypothetical near-future technology that (I hear) will be able to do pretty much whatever a human brain can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many, AGI is more than just a technology. In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, it’s talked about in mystical terms. Ilya Sutskever, cofounder and former chief scientist at OpenAI, is said to have led chants of “Feel the AGI!” at team meetings. And he feels it more than most: In 2024, he left OpenAI, whose stated mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, to cofound Safe Superintelligence, a startup dedicated to figuring out how to avoid a so-called rogue AGI (or control it when it comes). Superintelligence is the hot new flavor—&lt;em&gt;AGI but better!&lt;/em&gt;—introduced as talk of AGI becomes commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sutskever also exemplifies the mixed-up motivations at play among many self-anointed AGI evangelists. He has spent his career building the foundations for a future technology that he now finds terrifying. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering—there will be a before and an after,” he told me a few months before he quit OpenAI. When I asked him why he had redirected his efforts into reining that technology in, he said: “I’m doing it for my own self-interest. It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s far from alone in his grandiose, even apocalyptic, thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Every age has its believers, people with an unshakeable faith that something huge is about to happen—a before and an after that they are privileged (or doomed) to live through.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For us, that’s the promised advent of AGI. People are used to hearing that this or that is the next big thing, says Shannon Vallor, who studies the ethics of technology at the University of Edinburgh. “It used to be the computer age and then it was the internet age and now it’s the AI age,” she says. “It’s normal to have something presented to you and be told that this thing is the future. What’s different, of course, is that in contrast to computers and the internet, AGI doesn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s why &lt;em&gt;feeling the AGI &lt;/em&gt;is not the same as boosting the next big thing. There’s something weirder going on. Here’s what I think: AGI is a lot like a conspiracy theory, and it may be the most consequential one of our time.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I have been reporting on artificial intelligence for more than a decade, and I’ve watched the idea of AGI bubble up from the backwaters to become the dominant narrative shaping an entire industry. A onetime pipe dream now props up the profit lines of some of the world’s most valuable companies and thus, you could argue, the US stock market. It justifies dizzying down payments on the new power plants and data centers that we’re told are needed to make the dream come true. Fixated on this hypothetical technology, AI firms are selling us hard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just listen to what the heads of some of those companies are telling us. AGI will be as smart as an entire “country of geniuses” (Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic); it will kick-start “an era of maximum human flourishing, where we travel to the stars and colonize the galaxy” (Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind); it will “massively increase abundance and prosperity,” even encourage people to enjoy life more and have more children (Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI). That’s some product.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or not. Don’t forget the flip side, of course. When those people are not shilling for utopia, they’re saving us from hell. In 2023, Amodei, Hassabis, and Altman all put their names to a 22-word statement that read: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Elon Musk says AI has a 20% chance of annihilating humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve noticed recently that superintelligence, which I thought was a concept you definitely shouldn’t mention if you want to be taken seriously in public, is being thrown around by tech CEOs who are apparently planning to build it,” says Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts, an organization that surveys AI researchers about their field. “I think it’s easy to feel like this is fine. They also say it’s going to kill us, but they’re laughing while they say it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to admit it all sounds a bit tinfoil hat. If you're building a conspiracy theory, you need a few things in the mix: a scheme that’s flexible enough to sustain belief even when things don’t work out as planned; the promise of a better future that can be realized only if believers uncover hidden truths; and a hope for salvation from the horrors of this world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AGI just about checks all those boxes. The more you poke at the idea, the more it starts to look like a conspiracy. It’s not, of course—not exactly. And I’m not drawing this parallel to dismiss the very real, often jaw-dropping results achieved by many people in this field, including (or especially) the AGI believers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But by zooming in on things that AGI has in common with genuine conspiracies, I think we can bring the whole concept into better focus and reveal it for what it is: a techno-utopian (or techno-dystopian—pick your pill) fever dream that got its hooks into some pretty deep-seated beliefs that have made it hard to shake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn't just a provocative thought experiment. It’s important to question what we’re told about AGI because buying into the idea isn’t harmless. Right now, AGI is the most important narrative in tech—and, to some extent, in the global economy. We can’t make sense of what’s going on in AI without understanding where the idea of AGI came from, why it is so compelling, and how it shapes the way we think about technology overall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I get it, I get it—calling AGI a conspiracy isn’t a perfect analogy. It will also piss a lot of people off. But come with me down this rabbit hole and let me show you the light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Silicon Valley got AGI-pilled&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It had a ring to it&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A typical conspiracy theory usually starts out on the fringes. Maybe it’s just a couple of people posting on a message board, gathering “evidence.” Maybe it’s a few people out in the desert with binoculars waiting to spot some bright lights in the sky. But some conspiracy theories get lucky, if you will: They start to percolate more widely; they start to become a bit more acceptable; they start to influence people in power. Maybe it’s the UFOs (ahem, sorry, “unidentified aerial phenomena”) that are now formally and openly discussed in government hearings. Maybe it’s vaccine skepticism (yes, a much more dangerous example) that becomes official policy. And it’s impossible to ignore that artificial general intelligence has followed a pretty similar trajectory to its more overtly conspiratorial brethren.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to 2007, when AI wasn’t sexy and it wasn’t cool. Companies like Amazon and Netflix (which was still sending out DVDs in the mail) were using machine-learning models, proto-organisms to today’s LLM behemoths, to recommend movies and books to customers. But that was more or less it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ben Goertzel had far bigger plans. About a decade earlier, the AI researcher had set up a dot-com startup called Webmind to train what he thought of as a kind of digital baby brain on the early internet. Childless, Webmind soon went bust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Goertzel was an influential figure in a fringe community of researchers who had dreamed for years of building humanlike artificial intelligence, an all-purpose computer program that could do many of the things people can do (and do them better). It was a vision that went far beyond the kind of tech that Netflix was experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Goertzel wanted to put out a book promoting that vision, and he needed a name that would set it apart from the humdrum AI of the time. A former Webmind employee named Shane Legg suggested &lt;em&gt;Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. It had a ring to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Legg cofounded DeepMind with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. But to most serious researchers at the time, the claim that AI would one day mimic human abilities was a bit of a joke. AGI used to be a dirty word, Sutskever told me. Andrew Ng, founder of Google Brain and former chief scientist at the Chinese tech giant Baidu, told me he thought it was loony.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what happened? I caught up with Goertzel last month to ask how a fringe idea went from crackpot to commonplace. “I’m sort of a complex chaotic systems guy, so I have a low estimate that I actually know what the nonlinear dynamic in the memosphere really was,” he said. (Translation: It’s complicated.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Goertzel reckons a few things took the idea mainstream. The first is the Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, an annual meeting of researchers that he helped set up in 2008, the year after his book was published. The conference was often coordinated with top mainstream academic meetups, such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference and the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. “If I just published a book with that name &lt;em&gt;AGI&lt;/em&gt;, it possibly would have just come and gone,” says Goertzel. “But the conference was circling through every year, with more and more students coming.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next is Legg, who took the term with him to DeepMind. “I think they were the first mainstream corporate entity to talk about AGI,” says Goertzel. “It wasn’t the main thing they were harping on, but Shane and Demis would talk about it now and then. That was certainly a source of legitimation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I first talked to Legg about AGI five years ago, he said: “Talking about AGI in the early 2000s put you on the lunatic fringe … Even when we started DeepMind in 2010, we got an astonishing amount of eye-rolling at conferences.” But by 2020 the wind had changed. “Some people are uncomfortable with it, but it’s coming in from the cold,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third thing Goertzel points to is the overlap between early AGI evangelists and Big Tech power brokers. In the years between shutting down Webmind and publishing that AGI book, Goertzel did some work with Peter Thiel at Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital. “We talked a bunch,” says Goertzel. He recalls spending a day with Thiel at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. “I was trying to drum AGI into his head,” says Goertzel. “But then he was also hearing from Eliezer how AGI is going to kill everybody.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Enter the doomers&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s Eliezer Yudkowsky, another influential figure who has done at least as much as Goertzel, if not more, to push the idea of AGI. But unlike Goertzel, Yudkowsky thinks there’s a very high chance—99.5% is one number he throws out—that the development of AGI will be a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2000, Yudkowsky cofounded a nonprofit research outfit called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (later renamed the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), which pretty quickly dedicated itself to preventing doomer scenarios. Thiel was an early benefactor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At first, Yudkowsky’s ideas didn’t get much pickup. Recall that back then the idea of an all-powerful AI—let alone a dangerous one—was pure sci-fi. But in 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, published a book called &lt;em&gt;Superintelligence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It put the AGI thing out there,” says Goertzel. “I mean, Bill Gates, Elon Musk—lots of tech-industry AI people—read that book, and whether or not they agreed with his doomer perspective, Nick took Eliezer’s concepts and wrapped them up in a very acceptable way.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“All of these things gave AGI a stamp of acceptability,” Goertzel adds. “Rather than it being pure crackpot stuff from mavericks howling out in the wilderness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127106" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7_AGI-eye-rays_28ece9.jpg?w=1268" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yudkowsky has been banging the same drum for 25 years; many engineers at today’s top AI companies grew up reading and discussing his views online, especially on LessWrong, a popular hub for the tech industry’s fervent community of rationalists and effective altruists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, those views are more popular than ever, capturing the imagination of a younger generation of doomers like David Krueger, a researcher at the University of Montreal who previously served as research director at the UK’s AI Security Institute. “I think we are definitely on track to build superhuman AI systems that will kill everybody,” Krueger tells me. “And I think that’s horrible and we should stop immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yudkowsky gets profiled by the likes of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which bills him as “Silicon Valley’s version of a doomsday preacher.” His new book, &lt;em&gt;If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies&lt;/em&gt;, written with Nate Soares, president of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, lays out wild claims, with little evidence, that unless we pull the plug on development, near-future AGI will lead to global Armageddon. The pair’s position is extreme: They argue that an international ban should be enforced at all costs, up to and including the point of nuclear retaliation. After all, “datacenters can kill more people than nuclear weapons,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This stuff is no longer niche. The book is an &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; bestseller and comes with endorsements from national security experts such as Suzanne Spaulding, a former US Department of Homeland Security official, and Fiona Hill, former senior director of the White House National Security Council, who now advises the UK government; celebrity scientists such as Max Tegmark and George Church; and other household names, including Stephen Fry, Mark Ruffalo, and Grimes. Yudkowsky now has a megaphone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it is those early quiet words in certain ears that may prove most consequential. Yudkowsky is credited with introducing Thiel to DeepMind’s founders, after which Thiel became one of the first big investors in the company. Having merged with Google, it is now the in-house AI lab for the tech colossus Alphabet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alongside Musk, Thiel was also instrumental in setting up OpenAI in 2015, sinking millions into a startup founded on the singular ambition to build AGI—and make it safe. In 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “eliezer has IMO done more to accelerate AGI than anyone else. certainly he got many of us interested in AGI.” Yudkowsky might one day deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for that, Altman added. But by this point, Thiel had apparently grown wary of the “AI safety people” and the power they were gaining. “You don’t understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe in that stuff,” he is reported to have told Altman at a dinner party in late 2023. “You need to take this more seriously.” Altman “tried not to roll his eyes,” according to &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Keach Hagey.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is now the most valuable private company in the world, worth half a trillion dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And the transformation is complete: Like all the most powerful conspiracies, AGI has slipped into the mainstream and taken hold.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The great AGI conspiracy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “AGI” may have been popularized less than 20 years ago, but the mythmaking behind it has been there since the start of the computer age—a cosmic microwave background of chutzpah and marketing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alan Turing asked if machines could think only five years after the first electronic computer, ENIAC, was built in 1945. And here’s Turing a little later, in a 1951 radio broadcast: “It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in 1955, the computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues applied for US government funding to create what they fatefully chose to call “artificial intelligence”—a canny spin, given that computers at the time were the size of a room and as dumb as a thermostat. Even so, as McCarthy wrote in that funding application: “An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s this myth that’s the root of the AGI conspiracy. A smarter-than-human machine that can do it all is not a technology. It’s a dream, unmoored from reality. Once you see that, other parallels with conspiracy thinking start to leap out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It’s impossible to debunk a shape-shifting idea like AGI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Talking about AGI can sometimes feel like arguing with an enthusiastic Redditor about what drugs (or particles in the sky) are controlling your mind. Each point has a counterpoint that tries to chip away at your own sense of what’s true. Ultimately, it’s a clash of worldviews, not an exchange of evidence-based reason. AGI is like that, too—it’s slippery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that despite all the money, all the talk, nobody knows how to build it. More than that: Most people don’t even agree on what AGI really is—which helps explain how people can get away with telling us it can both save the world and end it. At the core of most definitions you’ll find the idea of a machine that can match humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. (And remember, superintelligence is AGI’s shiny new upgrade: a machine that can &lt;em&gt;outmatch&lt;/em&gt; us.) But even that’s easy to pull apart: What humans are we talking about? What kind of cognitive task? And how wide a range?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s no real definition of it,” says Christopher Symons, chief artificial intelligence scientist at the AI health-care startup Lirio and former head of the computer science and math division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “If you say ‘human-level intelligence,’ that could be an infinite number of things—everybody’s level of intelligence is slightly different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And so, says Symons, we’re in this weird race to build … what, exactly? “What are you trying to get it to do?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, a team of researchers at Google DeepMind, including Legg, had a go at categorizing various definitions that people had proposed for AGI. Some said that a machine had to be able to learn; some said that it had to be able to make money; some said that it had to have a body and move about in the world (and maybe make coffee).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legg told me that when he’d suggested the term to Goertzel for the title of his book, the hand-waviness had been kind of the point. “I didn’t have an especially clear definition. I didn’t really feel it was necessary,” he said at the time. “I was actually thinking of it more as a field of study, rather than an artifact.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So, I guess we’ll know it when we see it? The problem is that some people think they’ve seen it already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2023, a team of Microsoft researchers put out a paper in which they described their experiences playing around with a prerelease version of OpenAI’s large language model GPT-4. They called it “Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence”—and it polarized the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a moment when a lot of researchers were blown away and trying to come to terms with what they were seeing. “Shit was working better than they had expected it to,” says Goertzel. “The concept of AGI genuinely started to seem more plausible.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet for all of LLMs’ remarkable wordplay, Goertzel doesn’t think that they do in fact contain sparks of AGI. “It’s a little surprising to me that some people with a deep technical understanding of how these tools work under the hood still think that they could become human-level AGI,” he says. “On the other hand, you can’t prove it’s not true.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there it is: &lt;em&gt;You can’t prove it’s not true&lt;/em&gt;. “The idea that AGI is coming and that it’s right around the corner and that it’s inevitable has licensed a great many departures from reality,” says the University of Edinburgh’s Vallor. “But we really don’t have any evidence for it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Conspiracy thinking looms again. Predictions about when AGI will arrive are made with the precision of numerologists counting down to the end of days. With no real stakes in the game, deadlines come and go with a shrug. Excuses are made and timelines are adjusted yet again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We saw this when OpenAI released the much-hyped GPT-5 this summer. AI stans were disappointed that the new version of the company’s flagship technology wasn’t the step change they expected. But instead of seeing that as evidence that AGI wasn’t attainable—or attainable with an LLM, at least—believers pushed out their predictions for how soon AGI would come. It &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;coming—just, you know, next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe they’re right. Or maybe people will pick whatever evidence they can to defend an idea and overlook evidence that counts against it. Jeremy Cohen, who studies conspiracy thinking in technology circles at McMaster University in Canada, calls this imperfect evidence gathering—a hallmark of conspiracy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen started his research career in the Arizona desert, studying a community called People Unlimited that believed its members were immortal. The conviction was impervious to contrary evidence. When its members died of natural causes (including two of its founders), the thinking was that they must have deserved it. “The general consensus was that every death was a suicide,” says Cohen. “If you are immortal and you get cancer and you die—well, you must have done something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen has since been focused on transhumanism (the idea that technology can help humans push past their natural limitations) and AGI. “I am seeing a lot of parallels. There are forms of magical thinking that I think is a part of the popular imagination around AGI,” he says. “It connects really well to the kinds of religious imaginaries that you see in conspiracy thinking today.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The believers are in on the AGI secret.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you think I’m an idiot: &lt;em&gt;You don’t get it at all lol. &lt;/em&gt;But that’s kind of my point. There are insiders and outsiders. When I talk to researchers or engineers who are happy to drop AGI into the conversation as a given, it’s like they know something I don’t. But nobody’s ever been able to tell me what that something is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The truth is out there, if you know where to look. Conspiracy theories are primarily concerned about revealing a hidden truth, Cohen tells me: “It’s a really fundamental part of conspiracy thinking, and that’s absolutely something that you see in the way people talk about AGI,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, a 23-year-old former OpenAI staffer turned investor, Leopold Aschenbrenner, published a much-dissected 165-page manifesto titled “Situational Awareness.” You don’t need to read it to get the idea: You either see the truth of what’s coming or you don’t. And you don’t need cold, hard facts, either—it’s enough to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it. Those who don’t just haven’t seen the light.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea stalked the periphery of my conversation with Goertzel, too. When I pushed him on why people are skeptical of AGI, for instance, he said: “Before every major technical achievement, from human flight to electrical power, loads of wise pundits would tell you why it was never going to happen. The fact is, most people only believe what they see in front of their faces.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That makes AGI sound like an article of faith. I put that to Krueger, who believes AGI’s arrival is maybe five years out. He scoffed: “I think that’s completely backwards.” For him, the article of faith is the idea that it &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; happen—it’s the skeptics who continue to deny the obvious. (Even so, he hedges: No one knows for sure, he says, but there’s no obvious reason that AGI won’t come.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hidden truths bring truth seekers, bent on revealing what they’ve been able to see all along. With AGI, though, it’s not enough to &lt;em&gt;uncover&lt;/em&gt; something hidden. Here, revelation requires an unprecedented act of &lt;em&gt;creation&lt;/em&gt;. If you believe AGI is achievable, then you believe that those making it are midwives to machines that will match or surpass human intelligence. “The idea of giving birth to machine gods is obviously very flattering to the ego,” says Vallor. “It’s an incredibly seductive thing to think that you yourself are laying the early foundations for that transcendence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's yet another overlap with conspiracy thinking. Part of the draw is the desire for a sense of purpose in an otherwise messy world that can feel meaningless—the longing to be a person of consequence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Krueger, who is based in Berkeley, says he knows people working on AI who see the technology as our natural successor. “They view it as akin to having children or something,” he says. “Side note: they usually don’t have children.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AGI will be our one true savior (or it’ll bring the apocalypse).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen sees parallels between many modern conspiracy theories and the New Age movement, which reached its peak of influence in the 1970s and ’80s. Adherents believed humanity was on the cusp of unlocking an era of spiritual well-being and expanded consciousness that would usher in a more peaceful and prosperous world. In a nutshell, the idea was that by engaging in a set of pseudo-religious practices, including astrology and the careful curation of crystals, humans would transcend their limitations and enter a kind of hippie utopia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today’s tech industry is built on compute, not crystals, but its sense of what’s at stake is no less transcendent: “You know, this idea that there is going to be this fundamental shift, there’s going to be this millenarian turn where we end up in a techno-utopian future,” says Cohen. “And the idea that AGI is going to ultimately allow humanity to overcome the problems that face us.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In many people’s telling, AGI will arrive all at once. Incremental advances in AI will stack up until, one day, AI will be good enough to start making better AI by itself. At which point—&lt;em&gt;FOOM&lt;/em&gt;—it will advance so rapidly that AGI will arrive in what’s often called an intelligence explosion, leading to a point of no return known as the Singularity, a goofy term that’s been popular in AGI circles for years. Co-opting a concept from physics, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge first introduced the idea of a technological singularity in the 1980s. Vinge imagined an event horizon on the path of technological progress beyond which humans would be fast outstripped by the exponential self-improvement of the machines they had created.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127225" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7_AGI-butterfly.jpg?w=1731" width="1731" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Call it the AI Big Bang—which, again, gives us a before and an after, a transcendent moment when humanity as we know it changes forever (for good or bad). “People imagine it as an event,” says Grace from AI Impacts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Vallor, this belief system is notable for the way that a faith in technology has replaced a faith in humans. Despite the woo-woo, New Age thinking was at least motivated by the idea that people had what it took to change the world by themselves, if they could only tap into it. With the pursuit of AGI, we’ve left that self-belief behind and bought into the idea that only technology can save us, she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a compelling—even comforting—thought for many people. “We’re in an era where other paths to material improvement of human lives and our societies seem to have been exhausted,” Vallor says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Technology once promised a route to a better future: Progress was a ladder that we would climb toward human and social flourishing. “We’ve passed the peak of that,” says Vallor. “I think the one thing that gives many people hope and a return to that kind of optimism about the future is AGI.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Push this idea to its conclusion and, again, AGI becomes a kind of god—one that can offer relief from earthly suffering, says Vallor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kelly Joyce, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how cultural, political, and economic beliefs shape the way we think about and use technology, sees all these wild predictions about AGI as something more banal: part of a long-term pattern of overpromising from the tech industry. “What’s interesting to me is that we get sucked in every time,” she says. “There is a deep belief that technology is better than human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joyce thinks that’s why, when the hype kicks in, people are predisposed to believe it. “It’s a religion,” she says. “We believe in technology. Technology is God. It’s really hard to push back against it. People don’t want to hear it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How AGI hijacked an industry&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fantasy of computers that can do almost anything a person can is seductive. But like many pervasive conspiracy theories, it has very real consequences. It has distorted the way we think about the stakes behind the current technology boom (and potential bust). It may have even derailed the industry, sucking resources away from more immediate, more practical application of the technology. More than anything else, it gives us a free pass to be lazy. It fools us into thinking we might be able to avoid the actual hard work needed to solve intractable, world-spanning problems—problems that will require international cooperation and compromise and expensive aid. Why bother with that when we’ll soon have machines to figure it all out for us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider the resources being sunk into this grand project. Just last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced an up-to-$100 billion partnership that would see the chip giant supply at least 10 gigawatts of ChatGPT’s insatiable demand. That’s higher than nuclear power plant numbers. A bolt of lightning might release that much energy. The flux capacitor inside Dr. Emmett Brown’s DeLorean time machine only required 1.2 gigawatts to send Marty back to the future. And then, only two weeks later, OpenAI announced a second partnership with chipmaker AMD for another six gigawatts of power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Promoting the Nvidia deal on CNBC, Altman, straight-faced, claimed that without this kind of data center buildout, people would have to choose between a cure for cancer and free education. “No one wants to make that choice,” he said. (Just a few weeks later, he announced that erotic chats would be coming to ChatGPT.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Add to those costs the loss of investment in more immediate technology that could change lives today and tomorrow and the next day. “To me it’s a huge missed opportunity,” says Lirio’s Symons, “to put all these resources into solving something nebulous when we already know there’s real problems that we could solve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that’s not how the likes of OpenAI needs to operate. “With people throwing so much money at these companies, they don’t have to do that,” Symons says. “If you’ve got hundreds of billions of dollars, you don’t have to focus on a practical, solvable project.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite his steadfast belief that AGI is coming, Krueger also thinks the industry's single-minded pursuit of it means that potential solutions to real problems, such as better health care, are being ignored. “This AGI stuff—it’s nonsense, it’s a distraction, it’s hype,” he tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there are consequences for the way governments support and regulate technology (or don’t). Tina Law, who studies technology policy at the University of California–Davis, worries that policymakers are getting lobbied about the ways AI will one day kill us all, instead of addressing real concerns about the ways AI could impact people’s lives in immediate and material ways today. Inequality has been sidetracked by existential risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Hype is a lucrative strategy for tech firms,” says Law. A big part of that hype is the idea that what’s happening is inevitable: If we don’t build it, someone else will. “When something is framed as inevitable,” Law says, “people doubt not only whether they should resist but also whether they have the capacity to do so.” Everyone gets locked in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGI distortion field isn’t limited to tech policy, says Milton Mueller at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who works on technology policy and regulation. The race to AGI gets compared to the race to the atomic bomb, he says. “So whoever gets it first is going to have ultimate power over everybody else. That’s a crazy and dangerous idea that really will distort our approach to foreign policy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a business incentive for companies (and governments) to push the myth of AGI, says Mueller, because they can then claim that they will be the first to get there. But because they’re running a race in which nobody has agreed on the finish line, the myth can be spun as long as it’s useful. Or as long as investors are willing to buy into it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see how this plays out. It’s not utopia or hell—it’s OpenAI and its peers making a whole lot more money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The great AGI conspiracy, concluded&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And maybe that brings us back to the whole conspiracy thing—and a late-game twist in this tale. So far we’ve ignored one popular feature of conspiracy thinking: that there’s a group of powerful figures pulling the levers behind the scenes and that, by seeking the truth, believers can expose this elite cabal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, the people feeling the AGI aren’t publicly accusing any Illuminati or WEF-like force of preventing the AGI future or withholding its secrets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But what if there are, in fact, shadowy puppet masters here—and they’re the very people who have pushed the AGI conspiracy hardest all along? The kings of Silicon Valley are throwing everything they can get at building AGI for profit. The myth of AGI serves their interests more than anybody else’s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As one senior executive at an AI company said to us recently, AGI always needs to be six months to a year away, because if it’s any further than that, you won’t be able to recruit people from Jane Street, and if it’s closer to already here, then what’s the point?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Vallor puts it: “If OpenAI says they’re building a machine that’s going to make corporations even more powerful than they are today, that isn’t going to get the kind of public buy-in that they need.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remember: You create a god and you become like one yourself. Krueger says there’s a line of thinking running through Silicon Valley in which building AI is a way to seize huge amounts of power. (It’s one of the premises of Aschenbrenner’s “Situational Awareness,” for example.) “You know, we’re going to have this godlike power and we’re going to have to figure out what to do with it,” says Krueger. “A lot of people think if they get there first, they can basically take over the world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They're putting so much effort into selling their vision of a future with AGI in it, and they’re having a pretty good amount of success because they have so much power,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Goertzel, for one, is almost lamenting how successful the maybe-cabal has been. He’s actually starting to miss life on the fringes. “In my generation, you had to have a lot of vision to want to work on AGI, and you had to be very stubborn,” he says. “Now it’s almost, like, what your grandma tells you to do to get a job instead of being a business major.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s disorienting that this stuff is so broadly accepted,” he says. “It almost gives me the desire to go work on something else that not so many people are doing.” He’s half joking (I think): “Obviously, putting the finishing touches to AGI is more important than gratifying my preference to be out on the frontier.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I'm no clearer on what exactly they’re putting the finishing touches on. What does it mean for technology in general if we fall so hard for the fairy tales? In a lot of ways, I think the whole idea of AGI is built on a warped view of what we should expect technology to do, and even what intelligence is in the first place. Stripped back to its essentials, the argument for AGI rests on the premise that one technology, AI, has gotten very good, very fast, and will continue to get better. But set aside the technical objections—what if it doesn't continue to get better?—and you’re left with the claim that intelligence is a commodity you can get more of if you have the right data or compute or neural network. And it’s not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence doesn’t come as a quantity you can just ratchet up and up. Smart people may be brilliant in one area and not in others. Some Nobel Prize winners are really bad at playing the piano or caring for their kids. Some very smart people insist that AGI is coming next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to wonder what will get its hooks into us next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we ended our call, Goertzel told me about an event he’d just been to in San Francisco on AI consciousness and parapsychology: “ESP, precognition, and whatnot.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s where AGI was 20 years ago,” he said. “Everyone thinks it’s batshit crazy.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you feeling it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hear it’s close: two years, five years—maybe next year! And I hear it’s going to change everything: it will cure disease, save the planet, and usher in an age of abundance. It will solve our biggest problems in ways we cannot yet imagine. It will redefine what it means to be human.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Wait—what if that’s all too good to be true? Because I also hear it will bring on the apocalypse and kill us all …&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Either way, and whatever your timeline, something big &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about to happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We could be talking about the Second Coming. Or the day when Heaven’s Gaters imagined they’d be picked up by a UFO and transformed into enlightened aliens. Or the moment when Donald Trump finally decides to deliver the storm that Q promised. But no. We’re of course talking about artificial general intelligence, or AGI—that hypothetical near-future technology that (I hear) will be able to do pretty much whatever a human brain can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For many, AGI is more than just a technology. In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, it’s talked about in mystical terms. Ilya Sutskever, cofounder and former chief scientist at OpenAI, is said to have led chants of “Feel the AGI!” at team meetings. And he feels it more than most: In 2024, he left OpenAI, whose stated mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, to cofound Safe Superintelligence, a startup dedicated to figuring out how to avoid a so-called rogue AGI (or control it when it comes). Superintelligence is the hot new flavor—&lt;em&gt;AGI but better!&lt;/em&gt;—introduced as talk of AGI becomes commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sutskever also exemplifies the mixed-up motivations at play among many self-anointed AGI evangelists. He has spent his career building the foundations for a future technology that he now finds terrifying. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering—there will be a before and an after,” he told me a few months before he quit OpenAI. When I asked him why he had redirected his efforts into reining that technology in, he said: “I’m doing it for my own self-interest. It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s far from alone in his grandiose, even apocalyptic, thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Every age has its believers, people with an unshakeable faith that something huge is about to happen—a before and an after that they are privileged (or doomed) to live through.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For us, that’s the promised advent of AGI. People are used to hearing that this or that is the next big thing, says Shannon Vallor, who studies the ethics of technology at the University of Edinburgh. “It used to be the computer age and then it was the internet age and now it’s the AI age,” she says. “It’s normal to have something presented to you and be told that this thing is the future. What’s different, of course, is that in contrast to computers and the internet, AGI doesn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that’s why &lt;em&gt;feeling the AGI &lt;/em&gt;is not the same as boosting the next big thing. There’s something weirder going on. Here’s what I think: AGI is a lot like a conspiracy theory, and it may be the most consequential one of our time.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I have been reporting on artificial intelligence for more than a decade, and I’ve watched the idea of AGI bubble up from the backwaters to become the dominant narrative shaping an entire industry. A onetime pipe dream now props up the profit lines of some of the world’s most valuable companies and thus, you could argue, the US stock market. It justifies dizzying down payments on the new power plants and data centers that we’re told are needed to make the dream come true. Fixated on this hypothetical technology, AI firms are selling us hard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just listen to what the heads of some of those companies are telling us. AGI will be as smart as an entire “country of geniuses” (Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic); it will kick-start “an era of maximum human flourishing, where we travel to the stars and colonize the galaxy” (Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind); it will “massively increase abundance and prosperity,” even encourage people to enjoy life more and have more children (Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI). That’s some product.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or not. Don’t forget the flip side, of course. When those people are not shilling for utopia, they’re saving us from hell. In 2023, Amodei, Hassabis, and Altman all put their names to a 22-word statement that read: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Elon Musk says AI has a 20% chance of annihilating humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve noticed recently that superintelligence, which I thought was a concept you definitely shouldn’t mention if you want to be taken seriously in public, is being thrown around by tech CEOs who are apparently planning to build it,” says Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts, an organization that surveys AI researchers about their field. “I think it’s easy to feel like this is fine. They also say it’s going to kill us, but they’re laughing while they say it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to admit it all sounds a bit tinfoil hat. If you're building a conspiracy theory, you need a few things in the mix: a scheme that’s flexible enough to sustain belief even when things don’t work out as planned; the promise of a better future that can be realized only if believers uncover hidden truths; and a hope for salvation from the horrors of this world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AGI just about checks all those boxes. The more you poke at the idea, the more it starts to look like a conspiracy. It’s not, of course—not exactly. And I’m not drawing this parallel to dismiss the very real, often jaw-dropping results achieved by many people in this field, including (or especially) the AGI believers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But by zooming in on things that AGI has in common with genuine conspiracies, I think we can bring the whole concept into better focus and reveal it for what it is: a techno-utopian (or techno-dystopian—pick your pill) fever dream that got its hooks into some pretty deep-seated beliefs that have made it hard to shake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn't just a provocative thought experiment. It’s important to question what we’re told about AGI because buying into the idea isn’t harmless. Right now, AGI is the most important narrative in tech—and, to some extent, in the global economy. We can’t make sense of what’s going on in AI without understanding where the idea of AGI came from, why it is so compelling, and how it shapes the way we think about technology overall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I get it, I get it—calling AGI a conspiracy isn’t a perfect analogy. It will also piss a lot of people off. But come with me down this rabbit hole and let me show you the light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Silicon Valley got AGI-pilled&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It had a ring to it&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A typical conspiracy theory usually starts out on the fringes. Maybe it’s just a couple of people posting on a message board, gathering “evidence.” Maybe it’s a few people out in the desert with binoculars waiting to spot some bright lights in the sky. But some conspiracy theories get lucky, if you will: They start to percolate more widely; they start to become a bit more acceptable; they start to influence people in power. Maybe it’s the UFOs (ahem, sorry, “unidentified aerial phenomena”) that are now formally and openly discussed in government hearings. Maybe it’s vaccine skepticism (yes, a much more dangerous example) that becomes official policy. And it’s impossible to ignore that artificial general intelligence has followed a pretty similar trajectory to its more overtly conspiratorial brethren.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to 2007, when AI wasn’t sexy and it wasn’t cool. Companies like Amazon and Netflix (which was still sending out DVDs in the mail) were using machine-learning models, proto-organisms to today’s LLM behemoths, to recommend movies and books to customers. But that was more or less it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ben Goertzel had far bigger plans. About a decade earlier, the AI researcher had set up a dot-com startup called Webmind to train what he thought of as a kind of digital baby brain on the early internet. Childless, Webmind soon went bust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Goertzel was an influential figure in a fringe community of researchers who had dreamed for years of building humanlike artificial intelligence, an all-purpose computer program that could do many of the things people can do (and do them better). It was a vision that went far beyond the kind of tech that Netflix was experimenting with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Goertzel wanted to put out a book promoting that vision, and he needed a name that would set it apart from the humdrum AI of the time. A former Webmind employee named Shane Legg suggested &lt;em&gt;Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. It had a ring to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few years later, Legg cofounded DeepMind with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman. But to most serious researchers at the time, the claim that AI would one day mimic human abilities was a bit of a joke. AGI used to be a dirty word, Sutskever told me. Andrew Ng, founder of Google Brain and former chief scientist at the Chinese tech giant Baidu, told me he thought it was loony.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what happened? I caught up with Goertzel last month to ask how a fringe idea went from crackpot to commonplace. “I’m sort of a complex chaotic systems guy, so I have a low estimate that I actually know what the nonlinear dynamic in the memosphere really was,” he said. (Translation: It’s complicated.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Goertzel reckons a few things took the idea mainstream. The first is the Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, an annual meeting of researchers that he helped set up in 2008, the year after his book was published. The conference was often coordinated with top mainstream academic meetups, such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference and the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. “If I just published a book with that name &lt;em&gt;AGI&lt;/em&gt;, it possibly would have just come and gone,” says Goertzel. “But the conference was circling through every year, with more and more students coming.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next is Legg, who took the term with him to DeepMind. “I think they were the first mainstream corporate entity to talk about AGI,” says Goertzel. “It wasn’t the main thing they were harping on, but Shane and Demis would talk about it now and then. That was certainly a source of legitimation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When I first talked to Legg about AGI five years ago, he said: “Talking about AGI in the early 2000s put you on the lunatic fringe … Even when we started DeepMind in 2010, we got an astonishing amount of eye-rolling at conferences.” But by 2020 the wind had changed. “Some people are uncomfortable with it, but it’s coming in from the cold,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third thing Goertzel points to is the overlap between early AGI evangelists and Big Tech power brokers. In the years between shutting down Webmind and publishing that AGI book, Goertzel did some work with Peter Thiel at Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital. “We talked a bunch,” says Goertzel. He recalls spending a day with Thiel at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. “I was trying to drum AGI into his head,” says Goertzel. “But then he was also hearing from Eliezer how AGI is going to kill everybody.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Enter the doomers&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s Eliezer Yudkowsky, another influential figure who has done at least as much as Goertzel, if not more, to push the idea of AGI. But unlike Goertzel, Yudkowsky thinks there’s a very high chance—99.5% is one number he throws out—that the development of AGI will be a catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2000, Yudkowsky cofounded a nonprofit research outfit called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (later renamed the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), which pretty quickly dedicated itself to preventing doomer scenarios. Thiel was an early benefactor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At first, Yudkowsky’s ideas didn’t get much pickup. Recall that back then the idea of an all-powerful AI—let alone a dangerous one—was pure sci-fi. But in 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, published a book called &lt;em&gt;Superintelligence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It put the AGI thing out there,” says Goertzel. “I mean, Bill Gates, Elon Musk—lots of tech-industry AI people—read that book, and whether or not they agreed with his doomer perspective, Nick took Eliezer’s concepts and wrapped them up in a very acceptable way.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“All of these things gave AGI a stamp of acceptability,” Goertzel adds. “Rather than it being pure crackpot stuff from mavericks howling out in the wilderness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127106" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7_AGI-eye-rays_28ece9.jpg?w=1268" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yudkowsky has been banging the same drum for 25 years; many engineers at today’s top AI companies grew up reading and discussing his views online, especially on LessWrong, a popular hub for the tech industry’s fervent community of rationalists and effective altruists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, those views are more popular than ever, capturing the imagination of a younger generation of doomers like David Krueger, a researcher at the University of Montreal who previously served as research director at the UK’s AI Security Institute. “I think we are definitely on track to build superhuman AI systems that will kill everybody,” Krueger tells me. “And I think that’s horrible and we should stop immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yudkowsky gets profiled by the likes of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which bills him as “Silicon Valley’s version of a doomsday preacher.” His new book, &lt;em&gt;If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies&lt;/em&gt;, written with Nate Soares, president of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, lays out wild claims, with little evidence, that unless we pull the plug on development, near-future AGI will lead to global Armageddon. The pair’s position is extreme: They argue that an international ban should be enforced at all costs, up to and including the point of nuclear retaliation. After all, “datacenters can kill more people than nuclear weapons,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This stuff is no longer niche. The book is an &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; bestseller and comes with endorsements from national security experts such as Suzanne Spaulding, a former US Department of Homeland Security official, and Fiona Hill, former senior director of the White House National Security Council, who now advises the UK government; celebrity scientists such as Max Tegmark and George Church; and other household names, including Stephen Fry, Mark Ruffalo, and Grimes. Yudkowsky now has a megaphone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, it is those early quiet words in certain ears that may prove most consequential. Yudkowsky is credited with introducing Thiel to DeepMind’s founders, after which Thiel became one of the first big investors in the company. Having merged with Google, it is now the in-house AI lab for the tech colossus Alphabet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alongside Musk, Thiel was also instrumental in setting up OpenAI in 2015, sinking millions into a startup founded on the singular ambition to build AGI—and make it safe. In 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “eliezer has IMO done more to accelerate AGI than anyone else. certainly he got many of us interested in AGI.” Yudkowsky might one day deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for that, Altman added. But by this point, Thiel had apparently grown wary of the “AI safety people” and the power they were gaining. “You don’t understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe in that stuff,” he is reported to have told Altman at a dinner party in late 2023. “You need to take this more seriously.” Altman “tried not to roll his eyes,” according to &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Keach Hagey.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is now the most valuable private company in the world, worth half a trillion dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And the transformation is complete: Like all the most powerful conspiracies, AGI has slipped into the mainstream and taken hold.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The great AGI conspiracy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The term “AGI” may have been popularized less than 20 years ago, but the mythmaking behind it has been there since the start of the computer age—a cosmic microwave background of chutzpah and marketing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alan Turing asked if machines could think only five years after the first electronic computer, ENIAC, was built in 1945. And here’s Turing a little later, in a 1951 radio broadcast: “It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, in 1955, the computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues applied for US government funding to create what they fatefully chose to call “artificial intelligence”—a canny spin, given that computers at the time were the size of a room and as dumb as a thermostat. Even so, as McCarthy wrote in that funding application: “An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s this myth that’s the root of the AGI conspiracy. A smarter-than-human machine that can do it all is not a technology. It’s a dream, unmoored from reality. Once you see that, other parallels with conspiracy thinking start to leap out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;It’s impossible to debunk a shape-shifting idea like AGI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Talking about AGI can sometimes feel like arguing with an enthusiastic Redditor about what drugs (or particles in the sky) are controlling your mind. Each point has a counterpoint that tries to chip away at your own sense of what’s true. Ultimately, it’s a clash of worldviews, not an exchange of evidence-based reason. AGI is like that, too—it’s slippery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that despite all the money, all the talk, nobody knows how to build it. More than that: Most people don’t even agree on what AGI really is—which helps explain how people can get away with telling us it can both save the world and end it. At the core of most definitions you’ll find the idea of a machine that can match humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. (And remember, superintelligence is AGI’s shiny new upgrade: a machine that can &lt;em&gt;outmatch&lt;/em&gt; us.) But even that’s easy to pull apart: What humans are we talking about? What kind of cognitive task? And how wide a range?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s no real definition of it,” says Christopher Symons, chief artificial intelligence scientist at the AI health-care startup Lirio and former head of the computer science and math division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “If you say ‘human-level intelligence,’ that could be an infinite number of things—everybody’s level of intelligence is slightly different.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And so, says Symons, we’re in this weird race to build … what, exactly? “What are you trying to get it to do?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, a team of researchers at Google DeepMind, including Legg, had a go at categorizing various definitions that people had proposed for AGI. Some said that a machine had to be able to learn; some said that it had to be able to make money; some said that it had to have a body and move about in the world (and maybe make coffee).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legg told me that when he’d suggested the term to Goertzel for the title of his book, the hand-waviness had been kind of the point. “I didn’t have an especially clear definition. I didn’t really feel it was necessary,” he said at the time. “I was actually thinking of it more as a field of study, rather than an artifact.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So, I guess we’ll know it when we see it? The problem is that some people think they’ve seen it already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2023, a team of Microsoft researchers put out a paper in which they described their experiences playing around with a prerelease version of OpenAI’s large language model GPT-4. They called it “Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence”—and it polarized the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was a moment when a lot of researchers were blown away and trying to come to terms with what they were seeing. “Shit was working better than they had expected it to,” says Goertzel. “The concept of AGI genuinely started to seem more plausible.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet for all of LLMs’ remarkable wordplay, Goertzel doesn’t think that they do in fact contain sparks of AGI. “It’s a little surprising to me that some people with a deep technical understanding of how these tools work under the hood still think that they could become human-level AGI,” he says. “On the other hand, you can’t prove it’s not true.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And there it is: &lt;em&gt;You can’t prove it’s not true&lt;/em&gt;. “The idea that AGI is coming and that it’s right around the corner and that it’s inevitable has licensed a great many departures from reality,” says the University of Edinburgh’s Vallor. “But we really don’t have any evidence for it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Conspiracy thinking looms again. Predictions about when AGI will arrive are made with the precision of numerologists counting down to the end of days. With no real stakes in the game, deadlines come and go with a shrug. Excuses are made and timelines are adjusted yet again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We saw this when OpenAI released the much-hyped GPT-5 this summer. AI stans were disappointed that the new version of the company’s flagship technology wasn’t the step change they expected. But instead of seeing that as evidence that AGI wasn’t attainable—or attainable with an LLM, at least—believers pushed out their predictions for how soon AGI would come. It &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;coming—just, you know, next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe they’re right. Or maybe people will pick whatever evidence they can to defend an idea and overlook evidence that counts against it. Jeremy Cohen, who studies conspiracy thinking in technology circles at McMaster University in Canada, calls this imperfect evidence gathering—a hallmark of conspiracy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen started his research career in the Arizona desert, studying a community called People Unlimited that believed its members were immortal. The conviction was impervious to contrary evidence. When its members died of natural causes (including two of its founders), the thinking was that they must have deserved it. “The general consensus was that every death was a suicide,” says Cohen. “If you are immortal and you get cancer and you die—well, you must have done something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen has since been focused on transhumanism (the idea that technology can help humans push past their natural limitations) and AGI. “I am seeing a lot of parallels. There are forms of magical thinking that I think is a part of the popular imagination around AGI,” he says. “It connects really well to the kinds of religious imaginaries that you see in conspiracy thinking today.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The believers are in on the AGI secret.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you think I’m an idiot: &lt;em&gt;You don’t get it at all lol. &lt;/em&gt;But that’s kind of my point. There are insiders and outsiders. When I talk to researchers or engineers who are happy to drop AGI into the conversation as a given, it’s like they know something I don’t. But nobody’s ever been able to tell me what that something is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The truth is out there, if you know where to look. Conspiracy theories are primarily concerned about revealing a hidden truth, Cohen tells me: “It’s a really fundamental part of conspiracy thinking, and that’s absolutely something that you see in the way people talk about AGI,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, a 23-year-old former OpenAI staffer turned investor, Leopold Aschenbrenner, published a much-dissected 165-page manifesto titled “Situational Awareness.” You don’t need to read it to get the idea: You either see the truth of what’s coming or you don’t. And you don’t need cold, hard facts, either—it’s enough to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it. Those who don’t just haven’t seen the light.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This idea stalked the periphery of my conversation with Goertzel, too. When I pushed him on why people are skeptical of AGI, for instance, he said: “Before every major technical achievement, from human flight to electrical power, loads of wise pundits would tell you why it was never going to happen. The fact is, most people only believe what they see in front of their faces.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That makes AGI sound like an article of faith. I put that to Krueger, who believes AGI’s arrival is maybe five years out. He scoffed: “I think that’s completely backwards.” For him, the article of faith is the idea that it &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; happen—it’s the skeptics who continue to deny the obvious. (Even so, he hedges: No one knows for sure, he says, but there’s no obvious reason that AGI won’t come.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hidden truths bring truth seekers, bent on revealing what they’ve been able to see all along. With AGI, though, it’s not enough to &lt;em&gt;uncover&lt;/em&gt; something hidden. Here, revelation requires an unprecedented act of &lt;em&gt;creation&lt;/em&gt;. If you believe AGI is achievable, then you believe that those making it are midwives to machines that will match or surpass human intelligence. “The idea of giving birth to machine gods is obviously very flattering to the ego,” says Vallor. “It’s an incredibly seductive thing to think that you yourself are laying the early foundations for that transcendence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It's yet another overlap with conspiracy thinking. Part of the draw is the desire for a sense of purpose in an otherwise messy world that can feel meaningless—the longing to be a person of consequence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Krueger, who is based in Berkeley, says he knows people working on AI who see the technology as our natural successor. “They view it as akin to having children or something,” he says. “Side note: they usually don’t have children.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;AGI will be our one true savior (or it’ll bring the apocalypse).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cohen sees parallels between many modern conspiracy theories and the New Age movement, which reached its peak of influence in the 1970s and ’80s. Adherents believed humanity was on the cusp of unlocking an era of spiritual well-being and expanded consciousness that would usher in a more peaceful and prosperous world. In a nutshell, the idea was that by engaging in a set of pseudo-religious practices, including astrology and the careful curation of crystals, humans would transcend their limitations and enter a kind of hippie utopia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today’s tech industry is built on compute, not crystals, but its sense of what’s at stake is no less transcendent: “You know, this idea that there is going to be this fundamental shift, there’s going to be this millenarian turn where we end up in a techno-utopian future,” says Cohen. “And the idea that AGI is going to ultimately allow humanity to overcome the problems that face us.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In many people’s telling, AGI will arrive all at once. Incremental advances in AI will stack up until, one day, AI will be good enough to start making better AI by itself. At which point—&lt;em&gt;FOOM&lt;/em&gt;—it will advance so rapidly that AGI will arrive in what’s often called an intelligence explosion, leading to a point of no return known as the Singularity, a goofy term that’s been popular in AGI circles for years. Co-opting a concept from physics, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge first introduced the idea of a technological singularity in the 1980s. Vinge imagined an event horizon on the path of technological progress beyond which humans would be fast outstripped by the exponential self-improvement of the machines they had created.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127225" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7_AGI-butterfly.jpg?w=1731" width="1731" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Call it the AI Big Bang—which, again, gives us a before and an after, a transcendent moment when humanity as we know it changes forever (for good or bad). “People imagine it as an event,” says Grace from AI Impacts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Vallor, this belief system is notable for the way that a faith in technology has replaced a faith in humans. Despite the woo-woo, New Age thinking was at least motivated by the idea that people had what it took to change the world by themselves, if they could only tap into it. With the pursuit of AGI, we’ve left that self-belief behind and bought into the idea that only technology can save us, she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a compelling—even comforting—thought for many people. “We’re in an era where other paths to material improvement of human lives and our societies seem to have been exhausted,” Vallor says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Technology once promised a route to a better future: Progress was a ladder that we would climb toward human and social flourishing. “We’ve passed the peak of that,” says Vallor. “I think the one thing that gives many people hope and a return to that kind of optimism about the future is AGI.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Push this idea to its conclusion and, again, AGI becomes a kind of god—one that can offer relief from earthly suffering, says Vallor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kelly Joyce, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina who studies how cultural, political, and economic beliefs shape the way we think about and use technology, sees all these wild predictions about AGI as something more banal: part of a long-term pattern of overpromising from the tech industry. “What’s interesting to me is that we get sucked in every time,” she says. “There is a deep belief that technology is better than human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joyce thinks that’s why, when the hype kicks in, people are predisposed to believe it. “It’s a religion,” she says. “We believe in technology. Technology is God. It’s really hard to push back against it. People don’t want to hear it.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How AGI hijacked an industry&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fantasy of computers that can do almost anything a person can is seductive. But like many pervasive conspiracy theories, it has very real consequences. It has distorted the way we think about the stakes behind the current technology boom (and potential bust). It may have even derailed the industry, sucking resources away from more immediate, more practical application of the technology. More than anything else, it gives us a free pass to be lazy. It fools us into thinking we might be able to avoid the actual hard work needed to solve intractable, world-spanning problems—problems that will require international cooperation and compromise and expensive aid. Why bother with that when we’ll soon have machines to figure it all out for us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider the resources being sunk into this grand project. Just last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced an up-to-$100 billion partnership that would see the chip giant supply at least 10 gigawatts of ChatGPT’s insatiable demand. That’s higher than nuclear power plant numbers. A bolt of lightning might release that much energy. The flux capacitor inside Dr. Emmett Brown’s DeLorean time machine only required 1.2 gigawatts to send Marty back to the future. And then, only two weeks later, OpenAI announced a second partnership with chipmaker AMD for another six gigawatts of power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Promoting the Nvidia deal on CNBC, Altman, straight-faced, claimed that without this kind of data center buildout, people would have to choose between a cure for cancer and free education. “No one wants to make that choice,” he said. (Just a few weeks later, he announced that erotic chats would be coming to ChatGPT.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Add to those costs the loss of investment in more immediate technology that could change lives today and tomorrow and the next day. “To me it’s a huge missed opportunity,” says Lirio’s Symons, “to put all these resources into solving something nebulous when we already know there’s real problems that we could solve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that’s not how the likes of OpenAI needs to operate. “With people throwing so much money at these companies, they don’t have to do that,” Symons says. “If you’ve got hundreds of billions of dollars, you don’t have to focus on a practical, solvable project.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite his steadfast belief that AGI is coming, Krueger also thinks the industry's single-minded pursuit of it means that potential solutions to real problems, such as better health care, are being ignored. “This AGI stuff—it’s nonsense, it’s a distraction, it’s hype,” he tells me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there are consequences for the way governments support and regulate technology (or don’t). Tina Law, who studies technology policy at the University of California–Davis, worries that policymakers are getting lobbied about the ways AI will one day kill us all, instead of addressing real concerns about the ways AI could impact people’s lives in immediate and material ways today. Inequality has been sidetracked by existential risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Hype is a lucrative strategy for tech firms,” says Law. A big part of that hype is the idea that what’s happening is inevitable: If we don’t build it, someone else will. “When something is framed as inevitable,” Law says, “people doubt not only whether they should resist but also whether they have the capacity to do so.” Everyone gets locked in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The AGI distortion field isn’t limited to tech policy, says Milton Mueller at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who works on technology policy and regulation. The race to AGI gets compared to the race to the atomic bomb, he says. “So whoever gets it first is going to have ultimate power over everybody else. That’s a crazy and dangerous idea that really will distort our approach to foreign policy.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a business incentive for companies (and governments) to push the myth of AGI, says Mueller, because they can then claim that they will be the first to get there. But because they’re running a race in which nobody has agreed on the finish line, the myth can be spun as long as it’s useful. Or as long as investors are willing to buy into it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see how this plays out. It’s not utopia or hell—it’s OpenAI and its peers making a whole lot more money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The great AGI conspiracy, concluded&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And maybe that brings us back to the whole conspiracy thing—and a late-game twist in this tale. So far we’ve ignored one popular feature of conspiracy thinking: that there’s a group of powerful figures pulling the levers behind the scenes and that, by seeking the truth, believers can expose this elite cabal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, the people feeling the AGI aren’t publicly accusing any Illuminati or WEF-like force of preventing the AGI future or withholding its secrets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But what if there are, in fact, shadowy puppet masters here—and they’re the very people who have pushed the AGI conspiracy hardest all along? The kings of Silicon Valley are throwing everything they can get at building AGI for profit. The myth of AGI serves their interests more than anybody else’s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As one senior executive at an AI company said to us recently, AGI always needs to be six months to a year away, because if it’s any further than that, you won’t be able to recruit people from Jane Street, and if it’s closer to already here, then what’s the point?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Vallor puts it: “If OpenAI says they’re building a machine that’s going to make corporations even more powerful than they are today, that isn’t going to get the kind of public buy-in that they need.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remember: You create a god and you become like one yourself. Krueger says there’s a line of thinking running through Silicon Valley in which building AI is a way to seize huge amounts of power. (It’s one of the premises of Aschenbrenner’s “Situational Awareness,” for example.) “You know, we’re going to have this godlike power and we’re going to have to figure out what to do with it,” says Krueger. “A lot of people think if they get there first, they can basically take over the world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They're putting so much effort into selling their vision of a future with AGI in it, and they’re having a pretty good amount of success because they have so much power,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Goertzel, for one, is almost lamenting how successful the maybe-cabal has been. He’s actually starting to miss life on the fringes. “In my generation, you had to have a lot of vision to want to work on AGI, and you had to be very stubborn,” he says. “Now it’s almost, like, what your grandma tells you to do to get a job instead of being a business major.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s disorienting that this stuff is so broadly accepted,” he says. “It almost gives me the desire to go work on something else that not so many people are doing.” He’s half joking (I think): “Obviously, putting the finishing touches to AGI is more important than gratifying my preference to be out on the frontier.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I'm no clearer on what exactly they’re putting the finishing touches on. What does it mean for technology in general if we fall so hard for the fairy tales? In a lot of ways, I think the whole idea of AGI is built on a warped view of what we should expect technology to do, and even what intelligence is in the first place. Stripped back to its essentials, the argument for AGI rests on the premise that one technology, AI, has gotten very good, very fast, and will continue to get better. But set aside the technical objections—what if it doesn't continue to get better?—and you’re left with the claim that intelligence is a commodity you can get more of if you have the right data or compute or neural network. And it’s not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligence doesn’t come as a quantity you can just ratchet up and up. Smart people may be brilliant in one area and not in others. Some Nobel Prize winners are really bad at playing the piano or caring for their kids. Some very smart people insist that AGI is coming next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to wonder what will get its hooks into us next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we ended our call, Goertzel told me about an event he’d just been to in San Francisco on AI consciousness and parapsychology: “ESP, precognition, and whatnot.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That’s where AGI was 20 years ago,” he said. “Everyone thinks it’s batshit crazy.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1127057/agi-conspiracy-theory-artifcial-general-intelligence/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chatbots are surprisingly effective at debunking conspiracy theories (Artificial intelligence – MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126471/chatbots-are-surprisingly-effective-at-debunking-conspiracy-theories/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_Debunk.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s become a truism that facts alone don’t change people’s minds. Perhaps nowhere is this more clear than when it comes to conspiracy theories: Many people believe that you can’t talk conspiracists out of their beliefs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that’s not necessarily true. It turns out that many conspiracy believers &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;respond to evidence and arguments—information that is now easy to deliver in the form of a tailored conversation with an AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In research we published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; this year, we had over 2,000 conspiracy believers engage in a roughly eight-minute conversation with DebunkBot, a model we built on top of OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo (the most up-to-date GPT model at that time). Participants began by writing out, in their own words, a conspiracy theory that they believed and the evidence that made the theory compelling to them. Then we instructed the AI model to persuade the user to stop believing in that conspiracy and adopt a less conspiratorial view of the world. A three-round back-and-forth text chat with the AI model (lasting 8.4 minutes on average) led to a 20% decrease in participants’ confidence in the belief, and about one in four participants—all of whom believed the conspiracy theory beforehand—indicated that they did not believe it after the conversation. This effect held true for both classic conspiracies (think the JFK assassination or the moon landing hoax) and more contemporary politically charged ones (like those related to the 2020 election and covid-19).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s series “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Conspiracy Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is good news, given the outsize role that unfounded conspiracy theories play in today’s political landscape. So while there are widespread and legitimate concerns that generative AI is a potent tool for spreading disinformation, our work shows that it can also be part of the solution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even people who began the conversation absolutely certain that their conspiracy was true, or who indicated that it was highly important to their personal worldview, showed marked decreases in belief. Remarkably, the effects were very durable; we followed up with participants two months later and saw just as big a reduction in conspiracy belief as we did immediately after the conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our experiments indicate that many believers are relatively rational but misinformed, and getting them timely, accurate facts can have a big impact. Conspiracy theories can make sense to reasonable people who have simply never heard clear, non-conspiratorial explanations for the events they’re fixated on. This may seem surprising. But many conspiratorial claims, while wrong, seem reasonable on the surface and require specialized, esoteric knowledge to evaluate and debunk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, 9/11 deniers often point to the claim that jet fuel doesn’t burn hot enough to melt steel as evidence that airplanes were not responsible for bringing down the Twin Towers—but the chatbot responds by pointing out that although this is true, the American Institute of Steel Construction says jet fuel does burn hot enough to reduce the strength of steel by over 50%, which is more than enough to cause such towers to collapse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although we have greater access to factual information than ever before, it is extremely difficult to search that vast corpus of knowledge efficiently. Finding the truth that way requires knowing what to google—or who to listen to—and being sufficiently motivated to seek out conflicting information. There are large time and skill barriers to conducting such a search every time we hear a new claim, and so it’s easy to take conspiratorial content you stumble upon at face value. And most would-be debunkers at the Thanksgiving table make elementary mistakes that AI avoids: Do you know the melting point and tensile strength of steel offhand? And when your relative calls you an idiot while trying to correct you, are you able to maintain your composure?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;With enough effort, humans would almost certainly be able to research and deliver facts like the AI in our experiments. And in a follow-up experiment, we found that the AI debunking was just as effective if we told participants they were talking to an expert rather than an AI. So it’s not that the debunking effect is AI-specific. Generally speaking, facts and evidence delivered by humans would also work. But it would require a lot of time and concentration for a human to come up with those facts. Generative AI can do the cognitive labor of fact-checking and rebutting conspiracy claims much more efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In another large follow-up experiment, we found that what drove the debunking effect was specifically the facts and evidence the model provided: Factors like letting people know the chatbot was going to try to talk them out of their beliefs didn’t reduce its efficacy, whereas telling the model to try to persuade its chat partner without using facts and evidence totally eliminated the effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the foibles and hallucinations of these models are well documented, our results suggest that debunking efforts are widespread enough on the internet to keep the conspiracy-focused conversations roughly accurate. When we hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate GPT-4’s claims, they found that over 99% of the claims were rated as true (and not politically biased). Also, in the few cases where participants named conspiracies that turned out to be true (like MK Ultra, the CIA’s human experimentation program from the 1950s), the AI chatbot confirmed their accurate belief rather than erroneously talking them out of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To date, largely by necessity, interventions to combat conspiracy theorizing have been mainly prophylactic—aiming to prevent people from going down the rabbit hole rather than trying to pull them back out. Now, thanks to advances in generative AI, we have a tool that can change conspiracists’ minds using evidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bots prompted to debunk conspiracy theories could be deployed on social media platforms to engage with those who share conspiratorial content—including other AI chatbots that spread conspiracies. Google could also link debunking AI models to search engines to provide factual answers to conspiracy-related queries. And instead of arguing with your conspiratorial uncle over the dinner table, you could just pass him your phone and have him talk to AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are much deeper implications here for how we as humans make sense of the world around us. It is widely argued that we now live in a “post-truth” world, where polarization and politics have eclipsed facts and evidence. By that account, our passions trump truth, logic-based reasoning is passé, and the only way to effectively change people’s minds is via psychological tactics like presenting compelling personal narratives or changing perceptions of the social norm. If so, the typical, discourse-based work of living together in a democracy is fruitless.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But facts &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;dead. Our findings about conspiracy theories are the latest—and perhaps most extreme—in an emerging body of research demonstrating the persuasive power of facts and evidence. For example, while it was once believed that correcting falsehoods that aligns with one’s politics would just cause people to dig in and believe them even more, this idea of a “backfire” has itself been debunked: Many studies consistently find that corrections and warning labels reduce belief in, and sharing of, falsehoods—even among those who most distrust the fact-checkers making the corrections. Similarly, evidence-based arguments can change partisans’ minds on political issues, even when they are actively reminded that the argument goes against their party leader’s position. And simply reminding people to think about whether content is accurate before they share it can substantially reduce the spread of misinformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if facts aren’t dead, then there’s hope for democracy—though this arguably requires a consensus set of facts from which rival factions can work. There is indeed widespread partisan disagreement on basic facts, and a disturbing level of belief in conspiracy theories. Yet this doesn’t necessarily mean our minds are inescapably warped by our politics and identities. When faced with evidence—even inconvenient or uncomfortable evidence—many people &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;shift their thinking in response. And so if it’s possible to disseminate accurate information widely enough, perhaps with the help of AI, we may be able to reestablish the factual common ground that is missing from society today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can try our debunking bot yourself at at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;debunkbot.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomas Costello is an assistant professor in social and decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.

Samsung’s semiconductor recovery reflects calculated strategic pivots made during its downturn, market dynamics that finally shifted in its favour, and intense competitive pressures that forced the company to accelerate its AI chip roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The road back from the slump&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung’s journey to this quarter’s performance began in a different place. Throughout 2024 and into early 2025, the company faced multiple headwinds: a brutal memory chip glut that collapsed prices, delayed qualification of its HBM products with key customers, and the company seeing rival SK Hynix capture early leadership in AI memory chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low point came in the second quarter of 2025, when Samsung’s chip division reported operating profit that had analysts questioning whether the company had lost its technological edge. SK Hynix had seized the top spot in the memory market for the first time, fueled by its early success supplying HBM chips to Nvidia’s AI accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, contextualised Samsung’s third-quarter performance as “a clear result of a broader memory market boom and rising prices for general-purpose memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hwang’s firm also noted that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market from SK Hynix during Q3, suggesting the semiconductor recovery involved more than just favourable market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HBM: From laggard to mass production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung’s ability to reverse its HBM fortunes proved central to the turnaround. The company confirmed that HBM3E is now “in mass production and being sold to all related customers,” while HBM4 samples are “simultaneously being shipped to key clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports emerged in late September that Samsung had passed Nvidia’s qualification tests for advanced high-bandwidth memory chips – a important milestone that had eluded the company for months. While Samsung hasn’t confirmed the Nvidia qualification publicly, the timing aligns with the acceleration in HBM sales reflected in Q3 results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the company’s earnings call, a Samsung executive outlined the demand environment: “We expect data centre companies to continuously expand their hardware investment because of the ongoing competition to secure AI infrastructure. Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That supply-demand imbalance has created pricing power that Samsung lacked during its declining quarters. The company specifically cited “a favourable price environment” and “notably reduced one-off costs like inventory value adjustments” as contributors to higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond memory: Foundry progress and challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung’s semiconductor recovery extended beyond memory chips. The Foundry Business, which manufactures chips designed by other companies, “posted a significant improvement in earnings in Q3 2025, stemming from a reduction in one-off costs and better fab use.” The division also achieved “record-high customer orders, mainly on advanced nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundry business is ramping up mass production of 2-nanometer Gate-All-Around (GAA) products, an important technology that helps maintain competitiveness against TSMC, the company that dominates the foundry market. Samsung indicated it would begin operations at its fab in Taylor, Texas, “in a timely manner” in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the System LSI Business, which designs Samsung’s Exynos processors and image sensors, saw earnings stall “due to seasonality and customer inventory adjustments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What this means for 2026&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung’s guidance for the coming year reflects confidence that the semiconductor recovery has staying power. The Memory Business will “focus on the mass production of HBM4 products with differentiated performance” while aiming to “scale out the HBM sales base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans capacity expansion in its 1c manufacturing process to meet projected HBM4 demand increases. Consolidated revenue for the quarter reached KRW 86.1 trillion, a 15.4% increase from the previous quarter and 8.85% higher year-over-year. The Device eXperience division, which includes smartphones, contributed KRW 34.1 trillion in revenue, supported by the Galaxy Z Fold7 launch and strong flagship sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges persist. Samsung Display reported solid performance with KRW 8.1 trillion in revenue and KRW 1.2 trillion in operating profit, but the Visual Display business recorded an operating loss of KRW 0.1 trillion despite “solid sales growth of premium products,” citing “intensified competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor recovery that Samsung achieved in Q3 2025 resolves the immediate crisis that threatened its market position. Whether the company can sustain this momentum while navigating intense competition from SK Hynix in HBM, TSMC in foundry, and emerging geopolitical pressures on the chip industry will determine if this quarter marked a true turning point or merely a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Samsung has demonstrated that even after four quarters of decline, strategic execution and market timing can still produce a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Babak Habibi)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Samsung AI strategy delivers record revenue despite semiconductor headwinds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110128" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Thailand already has an active creative scene, and this launch is meant to support more visual storytelling from the region. The app’s rollout also includes Vietnam and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sora first arrived in the US and Canada in early September, and many users there have already shared clips. The app has since passed one million downloads in under five days, according to a social media post by Sora head Bill Peebles, who noted that it reached that milestone even faster than ChatGPT did at launch, despite requiring users to be invited to use the app at launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in Thailand can download the app for free on iOS with no invite code. For now, use limits are relatively generous, though those limits may change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is powered by Sora 2, a video generation model that can produce ‘original’ clips, remix existing creations, and suggest content through a personal feed. Users can also appear directly inside scenes through a feature called Cameos, which requires a one-time check to confirm identity and likeness. The app supports Thai language input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameos have quickly become a popular feature among early testers as they offer a playful way to interact and connect with friends. Thai creator Woody Milintachinda said, “Sora allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that immediately resonates with audiences. They can see and feel the story unfold. It has also given me a unique platform to share my experiences with a wide community of creators and storytellers not just in Thailand but the world, inspiring new forms of connection and creativity. With Sora, the creative possibilities truly feel limitless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go with this release, the app now includes Character Cameos, with which users can turn nearly anything into a reusable character, such as a pet, drawing, personal item, or original design created inside Sora. After uploading a video of the character, users can assign permissions that are separate from their personal likeness. That character can stay private, be shared only with followers, or be opened to everyone on the platform. Once named, the character can appear in any future video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the Halloween season, the app launches with a starter pack that includes classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, Ghost, Witch, and Jack-O-Lantern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says it plans to bring Sora to Thailand with responsibility in mind. The feed is designed to encourage creation rather than passive viewing, aimed at accounts users follow. The aim is not to increase screen time but to spark creative output, the company states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can keep control of their likeness when using Cameos, deciding who can use it, and the account holder can remove access or take down any video that includes their likeness at any time. Videos made with a cameo of the user created by someone else remain visible to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos produced in Sora include a visible, animated watermark and an invisible C2PA digital watermark. The hidden version cannot be added to content that was not created in Sora, helping confirm which clips were created on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For teens, the app applies daily limits on how many generated videos appear in their feed. Cameos also come with stricter rules for this demographic. Safety systems exist, and human moderators can review bullying cases. Parents can use ChatGPT-based controls to adjust feed limits, turn off personalisation, and manage direct message settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Mariia Shalabaieva)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: OpenAI unveils open-weight AI safety models for developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110128" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he’s thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Let’s get into it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are we too focused on near-term climate goals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the central points Gates made in his new memo is that he thinks the world is too focused on near-term emissions goals and national emissions reporting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So in parallel with the national accounting structure for emissions, Gates argues, we should have high-level climate discussions at events like the UN climate conference. Those discussions should take a global view on how to reduce emissions in key sectors like energy and heavy industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“The way everybody makes steel, it’s the same. The way everybody makes cement, it’s the same. The way we make fertilizer, it’s all the same,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As he noted in one recent essay for &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, he sees innovation as the key to cutting the cost of clean versions of energy, cement, vehicles, and so on. And once products get cheaper, they can see wider adoption.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s most likely to power our grid in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“In the long run, probably either fission or fusion will be the cheapest way to make electricity,” he says. (It should be noted that, as with most climate technologies, Gates has investments in both fission and fusion companies through Breakthrough Energy Ventures, so he has a vested interest here.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He acknowledges, though, that reactors likely won’t come online quickly enough to meet rising electricity demand in the US: “I wish I could deliver nuclear fusion, like, three years earlier than I can.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also spoke to China’s leadership in both nuclear fission and fusion energy. “The amount of money they’re putting [into] fusion is more than the rest of the world put together times two. I mean, it’s not guaranteed to work. But name your favorite fusion approach here in the US—there’s a Chinese project.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can carbon removal be part of the solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I had my colleague James Temple’s recent story on what’s next for carbon removal at the top of my mind, so I asked Gates if he saw carbon credits or carbon removal as part of the problematic near-term thinking he wrote about in the memo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates buys offsets to cancel out his own personal emissions, to the tune of about $9 million a year, he said at the roundtable, but doesn’t expect many of those offsets to make a significant dent in climate progress on a broader scale: “That stuff, most of those technologies, are a complete dead end. They don’t get you cheap enough to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Carbon sequestration at $400, $200, $100, can never be a meaningful part of this game. If you have a technology that starts at $400 and can get to $4, then hallelujah, let’s go. I haven’t seen that one. There are some now that look like they can get to $40 or $50, and that can play somewhat of a role.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Will AI be good news for innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During the discussion, I started a tally in the corner of my notebook, adding a tick every time Gates mentioned AI. Over the course of about an hour, I got to six tally marks, and I definitely missed making a few.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gates acknowledged that AI is going to add electricity demand, a challenge for a US grid that hasn’t seen net demand go up for decades. But so too will electric cars and heat pumps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I was surprised at just how positively he spoke about AI’s potential, though:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“AI will accelerate every innovation pipeline you can name: cancer, Alzheimer's, catalysts in material science, you name it. And we're all trying to figure out what that means. That is the biggest change agent in the world today, moving at a pace that is very, very rapid … every breakthrough energy company will be able to move faster because of using those tools, some very dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ll add that, as I’ve noted here before, I’m skeptical of big claims about AI’s potential to be a silver bullet across industries, including climate tech.

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the launch, gamers can score &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; for free with the purchase of a 12-month Ultimate membership — a bundle packed with everything needed to jump into the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week also brings 10 games, including the next big adventure in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Outer Worlds 2&lt;/i&gt;, the mystical new “Visions of Eternity” expansion for &lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&lt;/i&gt;, a clever classic from Capcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86850"&gt;&lt;img alt="Latest RTX 5080 rollout map on GeForce NOW" class="size-full wp-image-86850" height="628" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GFN_Thursday-GeForce_RTX_5080_Rollout_Updated.jpg" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86850"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amsterdam and Montreal will be the next regions to light up with GeForce RTX 5080-class power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sofia, Bulgaria, is the latest region to get GeForce RTX 5080-class power, with Amsterdam and Montreal coming up next. Stay tuned to GFN Thursday for updates as more regions upgrade to Blackwell RTX. Those who want to follow along can track latest progress on the server rollout page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cloud Suits Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86853"&gt;&lt;img alt="ARC Raiders on GFN" class="size-large wp-image-86853" height="945" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ARCRaiders_ScreenShot_TT2_06-1680x945.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86853"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resistance — now in 5K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt;, survival means banding together against overwhelming odds. Set in a retro‑futuristic world under siege, the game blends squad-based strategy with explosive firefights wrapped in a striking ‘80s-inspired sci-fi style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is simple but relentless: mysterious mechanical invaders, the ARC, rain down from orbit to strip Earth bare. Battling them takes teamwork, scavenged weapons and quick thinking across sprawling environments. Every encounter feels like a desperate stand where improvisation and cooperation turn the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; hits with full force, streaming at GeForce RTX 5080-class power. That means cinematic visuals at up to 5K resolution, silky-smooth 120-frames-per-second action and real-time ray tracing on nearly any device. It’s the closest thing to stepping into the fight — not just watching from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special launch offer makes this drop even bigger: &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; is included with every purchase of a new 12-month GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, now through Thursday, Nov. 20. Take advantage of the cloud’s most powerful tier and drop into the fight with premium performance from virtually anywhere. Supplies are limited, so join now and suit up before the skies get any darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cloud Is Out of This World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86856"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Outer Worlds on GeForce NOW" class="size-large wp-image-86856" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GFN_Thursday-The_Outer_Worlds_2-1-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space just got sassier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian Entertainment takes players to a new colony with &lt;i&gt;The Outer Worlds 2&lt;/i&gt;, a first-person sci-fi role-playing game brimming with cosmic chaos, corporate satire and unforgettable oddballs. With new worlds to explore and even more questionable choices to make, it’s everything fans loved from the first game — turned up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, players explore a new frontier teeming with alien life, rival factions and moral gray areas that would make any space explorer sweat. Build a crew, shape the story with choices both heroic and hilariously self-serving, and survive a galaxy where every decision sparks consequences — often explosive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GeForce NOW, &lt;i&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; shines brighter than ever. Stream the adventure at GeForce RTX 5080 power with ray-traced worlds, crisp visuals and silky-smooth performance, no matter the orbit. Grab a snack, make a bad choice and let the cloud do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sacrifice for Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86859"&gt;&lt;img alt="GW2 expansion on GeForce NOW" class="size-large wp-image-86859" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GFN_Thursday-Guild_Wars_II_Expansion-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86859"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come for the adventure and discover the hidden knowledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2 &lt;/i&gt;is setting sail for adventure with its latest expansion, &lt;i&gt;Visions of Eternity&lt;/i&gt;, whisking players off to the mysterious island of Castora for a fresh year filled with epic stories, new regions to explore and tons of magical mayhem. This sixth expansion brings new elite specializations for all professions, shiny legendary treasures to hunt, a revamped skimmer mount and the much-anticipated addition of homesteads and fashion templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump in to tackle bizarre creatures, navigate uncharted lands and face off in unified raids and strike missions. Whether polishing up a new build, decorating the homestead or chasing down legendary loot, gamers will find no shortage of ways to shape the story. Plus, new story chapters and major updates throughout the year mean the adventure is always evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play &lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity&lt;/i&gt; on GeForce NOW and skip past the grind of waiting for downloads or patches. Seamlessly log in and play on any supported device to get right to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Tricks, Just Treats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamers can solve a puzzle-packed murder case in &lt;i&gt;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective —&lt;/i&gt; the quirky, mystery classic from Capcom, directed by Shu Takumi, creator of the &lt;i&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/i&gt; series — now featuring high-definition visuals and upgraded sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BANG! A single bullet rings out in the dark city. But as one life ends, the story is just getting started. Sissel wakes up as a ghost and realizes he’s lost his memory along with his life. With only a few hours until sunrise — and oblivion — to uncover these answers, Sissel must solve the mystery of his own murder, starting with the detective who may have witnessed the crime. Using the powers of the dead, players can possess and manipulate objects, and even rewind time, as they work to solve brainteasing puzzles in a story chock-full of quirky humour and charming characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, members can look for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the launch, gamers can score &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; for free with the purchase of a 12-month Ultimate membership — a bundle packed with everything needed to jump into the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week also brings 10 games, including the next big adventure in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Outer Worlds 2&lt;/i&gt;, the mystical new “Visions of Eternity” expansion for &lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&lt;/i&gt;, a clever classic from Capcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86850"&gt;&lt;img alt="Latest RTX 5080 rollout map on GeForce NOW" class="size-full wp-image-86850" height="628" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GFN_Thursday-GeForce_RTX_5080_Rollout_Updated.jpg" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86850"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amsterdam and Montreal will be the next regions to light up with GeForce RTX 5080-class power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sofia, Bulgaria, is the latest region to get GeForce RTX 5080-class power, with Amsterdam and Montreal coming up next. Stay tuned to GFN Thursday for updates as more regions upgrade to Blackwell RTX. Those who want to follow along can track latest progress on the server rollout page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cloud Suits Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86853"&gt;&lt;img alt="ARC Raiders on GFN" class="size-large wp-image-86853" height="945" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ARCRaiders_ScreenShot_TT2_06-1680x945.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86853"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resistance — now in 5K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt;, survival means banding together against overwhelming odds. Set in a retro‑futuristic world under siege, the game blends squad-based strategy with explosive firefights wrapped in a striking ‘80s-inspired sci-fi style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is simple but relentless: mysterious mechanical invaders, the ARC, rain down from orbit to strip Earth bare. Battling them takes teamwork, scavenged weapons and quick thinking across sprawling environments. Every encounter feels like a desperate stand where improvisation and cooperation turn the tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; hits with full force, streaming at GeForce RTX 5080-class power. That means cinematic visuals at up to 5K resolution, silky-smooth 120-frames-per-second action and real-time ray tracing on nearly any device. It’s the closest thing to stepping into the fight — not just watching from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special launch offer makes this drop even bigger: &lt;i&gt;ARC Raiders&lt;/i&gt; is included with every purchase of a new 12-month GeForce NOW Ultimate membership, now through Thursday, Nov. 20. Take advantage of the cloud’s most powerful tier and drop into the fight with premium performance from virtually anywhere. Supplies are limited, so join now and suit up before the skies get any darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cloud Is Out of This World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86856"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Outer Worlds on GeForce NOW" class="size-large wp-image-86856" height="840" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GFN_Thursday-The_Outer_Worlds_2-1-1680x840.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space just got sassier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian Entertainment takes players to a new colony with &lt;i&gt;The Outer Worlds 2&lt;/i&gt;, a first-person sci-fi role-playing game brimming with cosmic chaos, corporate satire and unforgettable oddballs. With new worlds to explore and even more questionable choices to make, it’s everything fans loved from the first game — turned up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, players explore a new frontier teeming with alien life, rival factions and moral gray areas that would make any space explorer sweat. Build a crew, shape the story with choices both heroic and hilariously self-serving, and survive a galaxy where every decision sparks consequences — often explosive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GeForce NOW, &lt;i&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; shines brighter than ever. Stream the adventure at GeForce RTX 5080 power with ray-traced worlds, crisp visuals and silky-smooth performance, no matter the orbit. Grab a snack, make a bad choice and let the cloud do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sacrifice for Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2 &lt;/i&gt;is setting sail for adventure with its latest expansion, &lt;i&gt;Visions of Eternity&lt;/i&gt;, whisking players off to the mysterious island of Castora for a fresh year filled with epic stories, new regions to explore and tons of magical mayhem. This sixth expansion brings new elite specializations for all professions, shiny legendary treasures to hunt, a revamped skimmer mount and the much-anticipated addition of homesteads and fashion templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump in to tackle bizarre creatures, navigate uncharted lands and face off in unified raids and strike missions. Whether polishing up a new build, decorating the homestead or chasing down legendary loot, gamers will find no shortage of ways to shape the story. Plus, new story chapters and major updates throughout the year mean the adventure is always evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play &lt;i&gt;Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity&lt;/i&gt; on GeForce NOW and skip past the grind of waiting for downloads or patches. Seamlessly log in and play on any supported device to get right to the action.&lt;/p&gt;

Conspiracists are all over the White House, turning fringe ideas into dangerous policy. America’s institutions are crumbling under the weight of deep suspicion and the lasting effects of covid isolation. Online echo chambers are getting harder to escape, and generative AI is altering the fabric of truth. A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review helps break down how this moment is changing science and technology—and how we can make it through.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four thoughts from Bill Gates on climate tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bill Gates doesn’t shy away or pretend modesty when it comes to his stature in the climate world today. “Well, who’s the biggest funder of climate innovation companies?” he asked a handful of journalists at a media roundtable event last week. “If there’s someone else, I’ve never met them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The former Microsoft CEO has spent the last decade investing in climate technology through Breakthrough Energy, which he founded in 2015. Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he’s thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Here’s what he had to say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Casey Crownhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

When they added just four proteins to a skin cell and waited about two weeks, some of the cells underwent an unexpected and astounding transformation: they became young again. They turned into stem cells almost identical to the kind found in a days-old embryo, just beginning life’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least in a petri dish, researchers using the procedure can take withered skin cells from a 101-year-old and rewind them so they act as if they’d never aged at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after more than a decade of studying and tweaking so-called cellular reprogramming, a number of biotech companies and research labs say they have tantalizing hints that the process could be the gateway to an unprecedented new technology for age reversal.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MIT Technology Review helps break down how this moment is changing science and technology—and how we can make it through. We’re thrilled to present The New Conspiracy Age, a new series digging into how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To kick us off, check out Dorian Lynskey’s fascinating piece explaining why it’s never been easier to be a conspiracy theorist. And stay tuned—we’ll be showcasing a different story from the package each day in the next few editions of The Download!&lt;/p&gt;   
 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four thoughts from Bill Gates on climate tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bill Gates doesn’t shy away or pretend modesty when it comes to his stature in the climate world today. “Well, who’s the biggest funder of climate innovation companies?” he asked a handful of journalists at a media roundtable event last week. “If there’s someone else, I’ve never met them.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The former Microsoft CEO has spent the last decade investing in climate technology through Breakthrough Energy, which he founded in 2015. Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he’s thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Here’s what he had to say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Casey Crownhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

When they added just four proteins to a skin cell and waited about two weeks, some of the cells underwent an unexpected and astounding transformation: they became young again. They turned into stem cells almost identical to the kind found in a days-old embryo, just beginning life’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least in a petri dish, researchers using the procedure can take withered skin cells from a 101-year-old and rewind them so they act as if they’d never aged at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after more than a decade of studying and tweaking so-called cellular reprogramming, a number of biotech companies and research labs say they have tantalizing hints that the process could be the gateway to an unprecedented new technology for age reversal.

The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Figma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn’t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Figma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Weavy’s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3063966" height="412" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Weavy-5.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3063967" height="424" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Weavy-1.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they’ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They’ve also created a tool that’s just a joy to use,” Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday, Google announced a partnership with Reliance, India’s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity teamed up with Reliance’s archrival Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel’s 360 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India, the world’s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier — a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,” the Indian telecom giant said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 18-month offer is valued at ₹35,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google’s AI Pro plan normally costs ₹1,950 (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance’s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today’s announcement will put Google’s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India’s vibrant developer community,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google’s Nano Banana, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered — where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,” Ambani said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gemini.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;In a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani–led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today’s announcement will put Google’s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India’s vibrant developer community,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world’s biggest emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Earlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google’s Nano Banana, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India’s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Through our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered — where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,” Ambani said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:06:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] AI-Powered Mobile Clinics Deliver Breast Cancer Screening to India’s Rural Communities (NVIDIA Blog)</title><link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/medcognetics-ai-powered-breast-cancer-screening-india/</link><description>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unassuming van driving around rural India uses powerful AI technology that’s enabling low-cost, high-quality breast cancer screenings for thousands of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run by the nonprofit Health Within Reach Foundation, the Women Cancer Screening Van runs an AI solution by MedCognetics, a Dallas, Texas-based company that’s part of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital mammography machine aboard the van has to date screened mammogram data from more than 3,500 patients — 90% of whom had never had a mammogram before. This data is triaged onsite with the help of the AI solution by MedCognetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Developing countries generally have a lot of load on their existing healthcare institutions,” said Dr. Mudassar Shaikh, chief medical officer of the Health Within Reach Foundation. “This tech-enabled mobile healthcare program is solving a lot of healthcare access problems because, with the help of AI, we are able to bring high-quality care to peoples’ doorsteps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the thousands of mammograms the foundation has conducted in the last year in rural areas surrounding Pune, India, about 8% — 300 or so — returned abnormal findings. The foundation refers these patients to expert doctors in the city for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using our software built with NVIDIA technology, they identified 24 cancer-positive patients and connected them to treatment before the disease could progress further,” said Ron Nag, CEO and president of MedCognetics. “This is the way I want to see AI implemented around the world, to help people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Infographic with stats on the Women Cancer Screening Van: 3,500 mammograms conducted through the mobile clinic, 90% of patients had never had a mammogram before, ~300 abnormal findings identified, and 24 confirmed breast cancer diagnoses." class="alignnone wp-image-86895 size-large" height="672" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/medcog-stats-1680x672.jpg" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;MedCognetics Advances AI Screening Capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedCognetics produces AI systems that are FDA-cleared as software as a medical device. They can be deployed on the NVIDIA IGX Orin industrial-grade edge AI platform with the NVIDIA Holoscan platform for real-time sensor processing — or on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs hosted in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s suite of software for breast cancer screening includes algorithms for cancer triage, as well as features being prepared for regulatory submission such as cancer detection, breast density assessment and a risk analysis model that forecasts a patient’s likelihood of contracting breast cancer within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the integration of IGX Orin, the team is developing additional capabilities including image denoising, also being prepared for regulatory submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_86898"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-full wp-image-86898" height="220" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/medcog-screening.png" width="806" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-86898"&gt;Enhanced digital mammography requires two separate images to be captured, increasing the likelihood of patient motion causing artifacts on the image. MedCognetics’ AI models can help realign the images to present radiologists with a clearer view. Image on left does not include motion suppression — image on right does.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edge AI Bridges the Healthcare Accessibility Gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedCognetics’ critical contribution to the Health Within Reach Women Cancer Screening Van is rapid inference using India-based cloud resources, which lets staff quickly identify high-risk cases and connect to radiologists for prioritized reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Radiologists don’t travel with the cancer screening vans — once the van comes back to its urban hub, the mammogram images are uploaded onto our system for radiologist review,” Shaikh said. “In the future, fast AI analysis through hardware on the van could let us triage patients onsite, even at the remotest of areas were connectivity is lacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the MedCognetics software flags a potential tumor, the Health Within Reach team prioritizes that patient and immediately connects with a radiologist, sharing the patient’s mammography images for detailed analysis. This enables the radiologist to decide if additional imaging is needed and ensures that high-probability cases are escalated and attended to faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges is finding small tumors,” Nag said. “When we started, all the radiologists we spoke to said they didn’t want AI to help them see tumors the size of raisins or golf balls — they wanted AI to help them see the tumors that are so small they might easily be missed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the nearly two-thirds of the Indian population residing in rural areas, future edge AI deployments could expand the reach of high-quality care to communities where preventative healthcare is rarely sought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breast cancer tumors are generally painless, so there is a propensity for women in communities where healthcare is expensive or hard to access to postpone screenings or further investigation,” Shaikh said. “The majority of new cases are diagnosed in advanced stages, a factor that directly affects patient survival rates. That’s where regular, affordable and easily accessible mammogram screenings can make a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

AOL’s 30 million monthly active users represent an enduring brand and a data-rich resource that can be used in AI-driven services. That statement is true only if the data is properly governed and integrated. Such deals may blend nostalgia with business advantage, but present new compliance and cybersecurity risks that enterprises need to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By acquiring AOL from Yahoo, Bending Spoons moves to consolidate high-retention consumer technologies in its expanding digital portfolio. As companies turn increasingly to synthetic data to feed their AI’s learning corpus, the deal shows a different tactic, one of using established data assets and user bases to accelerate AI personalisation, advertising efficiency, and digital identity information gathering. It illustrates how older platforms – perhaps written off as legacy – can become profitable fuel for innovation when combined with cloud-native architectures and machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons has financed its expansion strategy with a $2.8 billion debt package from major global banks that include J.P. Morgan, BNP Paribas, and HSBC. There’s clearly growing lender confidence in the long-term monetisation of data, unlike during the ‘dot.com’ boom and bust, where the emphasis and interest was in purely software products. The acquisition, expected to close by year-end, follows Bending Spoons’ planned purchase of Vimeo. The two deals, if they go through, position the company as a major consolidator of internet assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implementation and operational challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating decades-old infrastructure like AOL’s presents technical challenges. Data migration from legacy email systems in line with current-day security protocols and compliance requirements needs careful stewardship. There’s also the not-insignificant issue of retraining staff for AI data stewardship on data that comes with significant buy-in from trusting service users. As with any digital acquisition, therefore, Bending Spoons’ success will depend on managing the technical and cultural dimensions of integration. Without strong governance, promising legacy platforms risk becoming compliance liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in any acquisition cycle, there will have been preparatory work in mapping data lineage, running integration and interoperability audits, and significant governance discussions. It’s worth noting that many integration pilots stall without shared accountability between technology and business functions: It’s easier to covet data than to work out how it can be put to business use, especially when the best an acquirer can hope for are limited examples of what they might get, once the ink has dried on the cheque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vendor and ecosystem context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Bending Spoons operates independently of major enterprise AI ecosystems, the logic of its acquisition aligns with Microsoft’s integration of LinkedIn data into Azure AI Foundry, and IBM’s efforts to reinvigorate legacy data with watsonx. AOL’s customer base and behavioural data could feasibly hold value with cloud analytics, customer profiling, and identity management frameworks, on even off-the-shelf platforms like AWS Bedrock, Azure, or Google Vertex AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Executive takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy platforms are not obsolete but they are often underused and undervalued. The differentiator lies in how organisations integrate historical data into modern AI governance and value delivery. Executives may see the AOL acquisition as a nostalgia play, but it’s a more hard-nosed imagining of a pure data asset.

          &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Character.AI announced it will bar anyone under the age of 18 from open-ended chats with its AI characters starting on November 25, implementing one of the most restrictive age policies yet among AI chatbot platforms. The company faces multiple lawsuits from families who say its chatbots contributed to teenager deaths by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next month, Character.AI says it will ramp down chatbot use among minors by identifying them and placing a two-hour daily limit on their chatbot access. The company plans to use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from connected social media accounts. On November 25, those users will no longer be able to create or talk to chatbots, though they can still read previous conversations. The company said it is working to build alternative features for users under the age of 18, such as the ability to create videos, stories, and streams with AI characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told The New York Times that the company wants to set an example for the industry. “We’re making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,” Anand said in the interview. The company also plans to establish an AI safety lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform currently has about 20 million monthly users, with less than 10 percent self-reporting as under 18, according to Anand. Users pay a monthly subscription fee starting at about $8 to chat with custom AI companions. (We first covered the service in September 2022 by interviewing a personification of the operating system Linux.) Until recently, Character.AI did not verify ages when people signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits and safety concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character.AI was founded in 2021 by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, two former Google engineers, and raised nearly $200 million from investors. Last year, Google agreed to pay about $3 billion to license Character.AI’s technology, and Shazeer and De Freitas returned to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company now faces multiple lawsuits alleging that its technology contributed to teen deaths. Last year, the family of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III sued Character.AI, accusing the company of being responsible for his death. Setzer died by suicide after frequently texting and conversing with one of the platform’s chatbots. The company faces additional lawsuits, including one from a Colorado family whose 13-year-old daughter, Juliana Peralta, died by suicide in 2023 after using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Character.AI announced changes, including improved detection of violating content and revised terms of service, but those measures did not restrict underage users from accessing the platform. Other AI chatbot services, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have also come under scrutiny for their chatbots’ effects on young users. In September, OpenAI introduced parental control features intended to give parents more visibility into how their kids use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases have drawn attention from government officials, which likely pushed Character.AI to announce the changes for under-18 chat access. Steve Padilla, a Democrat in California’s State Senate who introduced the safety bill, told The New York Times that “the stories are mounting of what can go wrong. It’s important to put reasonable guardrails in place so that we protect people who are most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill to bar AI companions from use by minors. In addition, California Governor Gavin Newsom this month signed a law, which takes effect on January 1, requiring AI companies to have safety guardrails on chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel, a New York–based startup, believes that’s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old health tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. The company also adds that the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days, rare numbers in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,” said co-founder and CEO Grey Nguyen in an interview with TechCrunch. “Bevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But with numerous health companion brands, from Whoop to Oura to Eight Sleep, why does the world need another one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to co-founder and board member Aditya Agarwal, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there’s an opportunity to create a product that’s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,” said Agarwal. “We already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3063834" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Bevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel’s story started with pain — literally.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder/CTO Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.&amp;nbsp;The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,” said Agarwal. “We already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.” Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area such as steps, sleep, or nutrition, Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company’s core software, which helps analyze key information and adapt recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3063834" height="340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2448.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Bevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bevel’s story started with pain — literally.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman–backed Campus, and co-founder/CTO Ben Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.&amp;nbsp;The demanding nature of startup life meant Nguyen took little care of his health, developing chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?” he said. “That’s when this idea came up. Everyone’s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually, through spreadsheets and connected trackers, to rebuild his energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When he connected with Ben and Grey about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,” said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With fresh capital and no plans to venture into wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand horizontally into more services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Bevel’s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,” said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. “The level of engagement they’re seeing from users is remarkable, and it’s become part of people’s daily lives — not just another app. We’re excited to support this team as they build the future of personal health.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/bevel-raises-10m-series-a-from-general-catalyst-for-its-ai-health-companion/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:05:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Is OpenAI worth $1 trillion?

          &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reuters during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;An OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters that “an IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,” adding that the company is “building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue grows as losses mount&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO preparations follow a restructuring of OpenAI completed on October 28 that reduced the company’s reliance on Microsoft, which has committed to investments of $13 billion and now owns about 27 percent of the company. OpenAI was most recently valued around $500 billion in private markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI started as a nonprofit in 2015, then added a for-profit arm a few years later with nonprofit oversight. Under the new structure, OpenAI is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but it gives the nonprofit a 26 percent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant for additional shares if the company hits certain milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful OpenAI IPO could represent a substantial gain for investors, including Microsoft, SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. But even so, OpenAI faces an uphill financial battle ahead. The ChatGPT maker expects to reach about $20 billion in revenue by year-end, according to people familiar with the company’s finances who spoke with Reuters, but its quarterly losses are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s earnings filing on Wednesday offered a glimpse at the scale of those losses. The company reported that its share of OpenAI losses reduced Microsoft’s net income by $3.1 billion in the quarter that ended September 30. Since Microsoft owns 27 percent of OpenAI under the new structure, that suggests OpenAI lost about $11.5 billion during the quarter, as noted by The Register. That quarterly loss figure exceeds half of OpenAI’s expected revenue for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;
