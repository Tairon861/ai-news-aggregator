&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s not as popular as I thought it would be, quite frankly,” Roslansky told Bloomberg. When asked why, he argued that the “barrier is much higher” to posting on LinkedIn, because “this is your resume online.” Plus, users can face real backlash if they post something that’s too obviously generated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re getting called out on X or TikTok, that’s one thing,” he added. “But when you’re getting called out on LinkedIn, it really impacts your ability to create economic opportunity for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, Roslansky noted that the professional social network has seen a 6x increase in jobs requiring AI-related skills over the past year, while the number of users adding AI skills to their profiles is up 20x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And he said he uses AI himself when he talks to his boss, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella:&amp;nbsp; “Every time, before I send him an email, I hit the Copilot button to make sure that I sound Satya-smart.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150483457-e1717774844734.jpg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;While LinkedIn users seem to have embraced AI, there’s one area that’s seen less uptake than expected, according to CEO Ryan Roslansky: AI-generated suggestions for polishing your LinkedIn posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The rule, as reportedly rewritten by Senate Commerce Chair Ted Cruz in an attempt to comply with budgetary rules, would withhold federal broadband funding from states if they try to enforce AI regulations in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And the rewrite seems to have passed muster, with the Senate Parliamentarian now ruling that the provision is not subject to the so-called Byrd rule — so it can be included in Republicans’ “One Big, Beautiful Bill” and passed with a simple majority, without potentially getting blocked by a filibuster, and without requiring support from Senate Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, it’s not clear how many Republicans will support the moratorium. For example, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee recently said, “We do not need a moratorium that would prohibit our states from stepping up and protecting citizens in their state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And while the House of Representatives already passed a version of the bill that included a moratorium on AI regulation, far-right Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene subsequently declared that she is “adamantly OPPOSED” the provision as “a violation of state rights” and said it needs to be “stripped out in the Senate.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the moratorium by saying it had President Donald Trump’s support and arguing, “We have to be careful not to have 50 different states regulating AI, because it has national security implications, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a recent report, Americans for Responsible Innovation (an advocacy group for AI regulation), wrote that “the proposal’s broad language could potentially sweep away a wide range of public interest state legislation regulating AI and other algorithmic-based technologies, creating a regulatory vacuum across multiple technology policy domains without offering federal alternatives to replace the eliminated state-level guardrails.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A number of states do seem to be taking steps toward AI regulation. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a high-profile AI safety bill last year while signing a number of less controversial regulations around issues like privacy and deepfakes. In New York, an AI safety bill passed by state lawmakers is awaiting Governor Kathy Hochul’s signature. And Utah has passed its own regulations around AI transparency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-950173010.jpg?resize=1200,861" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A Republican effort to prevent states from enforcing their own AI regulations cleared a key procedural hurdle on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-wide" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many organizations are eager to explore how AI can transform their business, its success will hinge not on tools, but on how well people embrace them. This shift requires a different kind of leadership rooted in empathy, curiosity and intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology leaders must guide their organizations with clarity and care. People use technology to solve human problems, and AI is no different, which means adoption is as emotional as it is technical, and must be inclusive to your organization from the start.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Empathy and trust are not optional. They are essential for scaling change and encouraging innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-ai-moment-feels-different"&gt;Why this AI moment feels different&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year alone, we’ve seen AI adoption accelerate at breakneck speed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, it was generative AI, then Copilots; now we’re in the era of AI agents. With each new wave of AI innovation, businesses rush to adopt the latest tools, but the most important part of technological change that is often overlooked? People.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, teams had time to adapt to new technologies. Operating systems or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools evolved over years, giving users more room to learn these platforms and acquire the skills to use them. Unlike previous tech shifts, this one with AI doesn’t come with a long runway. Change arrives overnight, and expectations follow just as fast. Many employees feel like they’re being asked to keep pace with systems they haven’t had time to learn, let alone trust. A recent example would be ChatGPT reaching 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates friction — uncertainty, fear and disengagement — especially when teams feel left behind. It’s no surprise that 81% of staff still don’t use AI tools in their daily work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This underlines the emotional and behavioral complexity of adoption. Some people are naturally curious and quick to experiment with new technology while others are skeptical, risk-averse or anxious about job security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To unlock the full value of AI, leaders must meet people where they are and understand that adoption will look different across every team and individual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-4-e-s-of-ai-adoption"&gt;The 4 E’s of AI adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful AI adoption requires a carefully thought-out framework, which is where the “four E’s” come in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evangelism – inspiring through trust and vision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before employees adopt AI, they need to understand why it matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evangelism isn’t about hype. It’s about helping people care by showing them how AI can make their work more meaningful, not just more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders must connect the dots between the organization’s goals and individual motivations. Remember, people prioritize stability and belonging before transformation. The priority is to show how AI supports, not disrupts, their sense of purpose and place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use meaningful metrics like DORA or cycle time improvements to demonstrate value without pressure. When done with transparency, this builds trust and fosters a high-performance culture grounded in clarity, not fear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enablement – empowering people with empathy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful adoption depends as much on emotional readiness as it does on technical training. Many people process disruption in personal and often unpredictable ways. Empathetic leaders recognize this and build enablement strategies that give teams space to learn, experiment and ask questions without judgment. The AI talent gap is real; organizations must actively support people in bridging it with structured training, learning time or internal communities to share progress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When tools don’t feel relevant, people disengage. If they can’t connect today’s skills to tomorrow’s systems, they tune out. That’s why enablement must feel tailored, timely and transferable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enforcement – aligning people around shared goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enforcement doesn’t mean command and control. It is about creating alignment through clarity, fairness and context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People need to understand not just what is expected of them in an AI-driven environment, but why. Skipping straight to results without removing blockers only creates friction. As Chesterton’s Fence suggests, if you don’t understand why something exists, you shouldn’t rush to remove it. Instead, set realistic expectations, define measurable goals and make progress visible across the organization. Performance data can motivate, but only when it’s shared transparently, framed with context and used to lift people up, not call them out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimentation – creating safe spaces for innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innovation thrives when people feel safe to try, fail and learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is&amp;nbsp; especially true with AI, where the pace of change can be overwhelming. When perfection is the bar, creativity suffers. Leaders must model a mindset of progress over perfection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my own teams, we’ve seen that progress, not polish, builds momentum. Small experiments lead to big breakthroughs. A culture of experimentation values curiosity as much as execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Empathy and experimentation go hand in hand. One empowers the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leading-the-change-human-first"&gt;Leading the change, human first&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting AI is not just a technical initiative, it’s a cultural reset, one that challenges leaders to show up with more empathy and not just expertise. Success depends on how well leaders can inspire trust and empathy across their organizations. The 4 E’s of adoption offer more than a framework. They reflect a leadership mindset rooted in inclusion, clarity and care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding empathy into structure and using metrics to illuminate progress rather than pressure outcomes, teams become more adaptable and resilient. When people feel supported and empowered, change becomes not only possible, but scalable. That’s where AI’s true potential begins to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Does that suggest something is amiss with the acquisition, or with plans for Ive to lead design work at OpenAI? Not exactly, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who reports that the “deal is on track and has NOT dissolved or anything of the sort.” Instead, he said a judge has issued a restraining order over the io name, forcing the company to pull all materials that used it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI subsequently confirmed this is the case, updating the old announcement page with the statement, “This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name ‘io.’ We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said this does not affect the deal with io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The iyO in question emerged from the Alphabet X “moonshot factory,” and its first announced product is a set of generative AI-powered earbuds. An earlier report at Bloomberg Law noted that iyO had brought a trademark lawsuit against OpenAI, with the judge suggesting she’s open to the company’s argument that OpenAI’s promotional video might already be creating consumer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For now, at least, the video remains viewable on X.&lt;/p&gt;
