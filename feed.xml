&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lovable specializes in helping people build apps and websites, especially people with no coding experience. It’s one of the standouts in the popular AI category known as vibe-coding, which lets users guide AI models as they produce code, websites, or whole applications.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s been an attractive proposition for users: In just eight months, the Swedish company said it surpassed $100 million in ARR and raised a $200 million Series A at a $1.8 billion valuation – making it Europe’s fastest-growing unicorn. The Financial Times reported that investors are already hoping to launch a Series B, offering deals that would value the company at $4 billion. So far, there’s no indication that Lovable is interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Speaking to TechCrunch, Osika laid out a vision for Lovable as the best place to build software products: a platform that can take users, founders, specifically, through all the stages of product development. so they can build AI-native companies more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you’re running a business, there are a lot of things you want to set up, like payments, understanding your users, and in the future, maybe even like ‘I need to incorporate my company,’” he said. “I want Lovable to help with all these things.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In late June, Lovable released an agent to help users read files, debug errors, search the web, generate images, and locate files – a first step in making good on that vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Lovable now has more than 2.3 million active users, 180,000 of which are paying subscribers. Osika said the company chose its pricing simply by deciding what would help the company cover its own costs. His favorite Lovable use cases include a marketer building a sales training platform and an engineer running multiple small businesses on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the past, you could create a really great first draft using Lovable. Now, you can build a full product and it’s much more like working with a real developer,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI-generated code has been criticized as overly brittle – better suited for demos than finished products – but Osika says he’s not concerned. All code should be reviewed before it is published, the CEO told us, “whether it is AI or human-generated.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Right now, Lovable operates on other foundational models, including Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s GPT-5. There is some tension to that relationship, as Anthropic and OpenAI both operate their own product-development services: Claude Code and Codex, respectively. Those systems aren’t exactly the same as Lovable, but it’s easy to imagine either model company trying to steal Lovable’s users with a strategic product shift.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So far, Osika doesn’t seem worried. He told TechCrunch that Lovable is simply focused on building the best product and is able to do that by leveraging all the different types of AI model providers, whereas providers need to stick to their own models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That puts us in a better position than them,” he continued, later adding that tapping into numerous foundation models gives its users “unmatched capabilities,” while also giving the company the flexibility to grow rapidly without carrying the weight of duplicative infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The scope of what you can achieve is constantly expanding,” he continued. To beat the competition, he says the team focuses on three things: how to remain fast and secure while providing an easy user experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If we continue to do that, we’re going to build more trust with our customers than anyone else,” he said. “Simple as that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s only one month since Figma, one of Lovable’s peers in the app-design space, launched its blockbuster IPO, reaching a $19.3 billion market cap on its opening day. When asked about Figma, Osika simply said the company is still focused on making the best product for its users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As long as we are listening to our users and giving them what they need, that’s all that matters,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Already, Lovable is deeply tied to the Swedish tech market. Osika grew up in Stockholm and founded the company there. The company’s list of investors, according to Pitchbook, include a list of top European firms and angel investors, like Stefan Lindeberg (Swedish, Nordic Game Ventures); Fredrik Hjelm (Swedish, founder of Guestit), Greens Ventures (Nordic), Hummingbird Ventures (London); 20VC (London, founded by Harry Stebbings who launched Project Europe to funnel more investments into the ecosystem).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Revolut CEO Nik Storonsky, who is based in Europe, is also an angel investor in the company, as is Swedish founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski, whose company Klarna is also a client of Lovable. Other well-known clients include HubSpot and Photoroom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All around the conference, investors and founders lamented what the company staying in Europe means for the, specifically, Nordic, startup ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The success of Lovable and other European AI unicorns is a success for all of Europe,” Shamillah Bankiya, a principal at the UK’s Dawn Capital, told TechCrunch. Though not an investor, her firm has followed Osika as a founder for a while and has invested in other AI companies through Dawn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Beyond the immediate impact of the thousands of Europeans employed by these companies, the greater effect is cultural,” she continued. “It raises the bar for what ambitious founders across the continent can dream of and achieve.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Osika said Lovable plans to stay nestled in Europe, though it does have a team in Los Angeles. Many European tech companies eventually find themselves migrating to the States for more capital and access to opportunities – but Osika doesn’t see Lovable as one of them, for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the wake of Lovable’s success, Osika has started to invest in those founders himself. Dennis Green-Lieber’s Danish consumer intelligence company, Propane.ai, just received an investment from Osika as part of its $1.2 million seed round. Green-Lieber said that Lovable proves what many in the Nordic scene already feel: They, too, have world-class talent and can play on the global stage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, we’ve had giants like Zendesk, Unity, Klarna, and Spotify over the past decade, but what Lovable shows is that with small teams, a global mindset, and relentless effort, you can still build a category-defining company,” he continued. “As a founder, I can say it’s lit a fire in our ecosystem to see this happen right here at home.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anton-Osika.jpg?resize=800,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Every seat in Copenhagen’s Bella Center was full as Anton Osika, the co-founder of the vibe coding app Lovable, took the stage at this year’s TechBBQ conference.&lt;/p&gt;

All are under the age of 35.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is developing a technology to reduce emissions from shipping, while two others are improving fertility treatments and creating new forms of contraception.

What’s more (here’s your final hint), our winner even set a world record as a result of this work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; first published a list of Innovators Under 35 in 1999. It’s a grand tradition for us, and we often follow the work of various featured innovators for years, even decades, after they appear on the list. So before the big announcement, I want to take a moment to explain how we select the people we recognize each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Call for nominations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our process begins with a call for nominations, which typically goes out in the final months of the previous year and is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. We encourage people to nominate themselves, which takes just a few minutes. This method helps us discover people doing important work that we might not otherwise encounter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year we had 420 nominations. Two-thirds of our candidates were put forward by someone else and one-third nominated themselves. We received nominations for people located in about 40 countries. Nearly 70% were based in the United States, with the UK, Switzerland, China, and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, having the next-highest concentrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After nominations close, a few editors then spend several weeks reviewing the nominees and selecting semifinalists. During this phase, we look for people who have developed practical solutions to societal issues or made important scientific advances that could translate into new technologies. Their work should have the potential for broad impact—it can’t be niche or incremental. And what’s unique about their approach must be clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Semifinalist applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year, we winnowed our initial list of hundreds of nominees to 108 semifinalists. Then we asked those entrants for more information to help us get to know them better and evaluate their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We request three letters of reference and a résumé from each semifinalist, and we ask all of them to answer a few short questions about their work. We also give them the option to share a video or pass along relevant journal articles or other links to help us learn more about what they do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Expert judges weigh in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next, we bring in dozens of experts to vet the semifinalists. This year, 38 judges evaluated and scored the applications. We match the contenders with judges who work in similar fields whenever possible. At least two judges review each entrant, though most are seen by three.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these judges volunteer their time, and some return to help year after year. A few of our longtime judges include materials scientists Yet-Ming Chiang (MIT) and Julia Greer (Caltech), MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden, and computer scientist Ben Zhao of the University of Chicago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;John Rogers, a materials scientist and biomedical engineer at Northwestern University, has been a judge for more than a decade (and was featured on our very first Innovators list, in 1999). Here’s what he had to say about why he stays involved: “This award is compelling because it recognizes young people with scientific achievements that are not only of fundamental interest but also of practical significance, at the highest levels.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Editors make the final calls&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a final layer of vetting, editors who specialize in covering biotechnology, climate and energy, and artificial intelligence review the semifinalists whom judges scored highly in their respective areas. Staff editors and reporters can also nominate people they’ve come across in their coverage, and we add them to the mix for consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last, a small team of senior editors reviews all the semifinalists and the judges’ scores, as well as our own staff’s recommendations, and selects 35 honorees. We aim for a good combination of people from a variety of disciplines working in different regions of the world. And we take a staff vote to pick an Innovator of the Year—someone whose work we particularly admire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s impossible to include every deserving individual on our list. But by incorporating both external nominations and outside expertise from our judges, we aim to make the evaluation process as rigorous and open as possible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So who made the cut this year? Come back on September 8 to find out.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Intro-f2-copy.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next week, we’ll publish our 2025 list of Innovators Under 35, highlighting smart and talented people who are working in many areas of emerging technology.

Two-thirds of our candidates were put forward by someone else and one-third nominated themselves. We received nominations for people located in about 40 countries. Nearly 70% were based in the United States, with the UK, Switzerland, China, and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, having the next-highest concentrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After nominations close, a few editors then spend several weeks reviewing the nominees and selecting semifinalists. During this phase, we look for people who have developed practical solutions to societal issues or made important scientific advances that could translate into new technologies. Their work should have the potential for broad impact—it can’t be niche or incremental. And what’s unique about their approach must be clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Semifinalist applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This year, we winnowed our initial list of hundreds of nominees to 108 semifinalists. Then we asked those entrants for more information to help us get to know them better and evaluate their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We request three letters of reference and a résumé from each semifinalist, and we ask all of them to answer a few short questions about their work. We also give them the option to share a video or pass along relevant journal articles or other links to help us learn more about what they do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Expert judges weigh in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next, we bring in dozens of experts to vet the semifinalists. This year, 38 judges evaluated and scored the applications. We match the contenders with judges who work in similar fields whenever possible. At least two judges review each entrant, though most are seen by three.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these judges volunteer their time, and some return to help year after year. A few of our longtime judges include materials scientists Yet-Ming Chiang (MIT) and Julia Greer (Caltech), MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden, and computer scientist Ben Zhao of the University of Chicago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;John Rogers, a materials scientist and biomedical engineer at Northwestern University, has been a judge for more than a decade (and was featured on our very first Innovators list, in 1999). Here’s what he had to say about why he stays involved: “This award is compelling because it recognizes young people with scientific achievements that are not only of fundamental interest but also of practical significance, at the highest levels.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Editors make the final calls&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a final layer of vetting, editors who specialize in covering biotechnology, climate and energy, and artificial intelligence review the semifinalists whom judges scored highly in their respective areas. Staff editors and reporters can also nominate people they’ve come across in their coverage, and we add them to the mix for consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last, a small team of senior editors reviews all the semifinalists and the judges’ scores, as well as our own staff’s recommendations, and selects 35 honorees. We aim for a good combination of people from a variety of disciplines working in different regions of the world. And we take a staff vote to pick an Innovator of the Year—someone whose work we particularly admire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s impossible to include every deserving individual on our list. But by incorporating both external nominations and outside expertise from our judges, we aim to make the evaluation process as rigorous and open as possible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So who made the cut this year?

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How lidar measures the cost of climate disasters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The wildfires that swept through Los Angeles County this January left an indelible mark on the Southern California landscape. The Eaton and Palisades fires raged for 24 days, killing 29 people and destroying 16,000 structures, with losses estimated at $60 billion. More than 55,000 acres were consumed, and the landscape itself was physically transformed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are using lidar (light detection and ranging) technology to precisely measure these changes in the landscape’s geometry—helping them understand and track the cascading effects of climate disasters.
