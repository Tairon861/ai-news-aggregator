Formerly known as SGE, AI overviews are the succinct AI-generated summaries of information that appear right at the top of Google for a majority of search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can serve as a convenient way to get a question answered quickly without having to sift through so many options of links to click on, it certainly has some issues. There have been plenty of instances of false information being presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and trust are particularly important in high-stakes industries like health, law, and finance. What happens when someone asks Google a medical or legal question and receives a wrong answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIO also poses new challenges for SEO professionals, as it reshapes how users search online and how businesses need to shift their SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iLawyer Marketing, a law firm SEO agency, offers perspective on how businesses in high-stakes industries can stay visible and trusted in an AI-driven search landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-technology-behind-ai-overviews-and-their-limitations"&gt;The technology behind AI overviews and their limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-generated summaries at the top of Google aren’t going anywhere. A recent study from Pew Research found that 58% of participants saw an AI-generated summary when conducting searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summaries are created using large language models (LLMs) that aggregate content, extract relevant answers, and provide source citations. However, AI Overviews contain the same misinformation that organic results can, and they can hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of controversy has arisen over AI hallucinations, or false statements that AI produces out of confusion. AI isn’t perfect, after all. There are also concerns over source transparency, as users can’t always tell where the answer is coming from at a glance. For high-stakes topics, that’s a problem. If the source is wrong or unreliable, the answer might be too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-and-opportunities-in-high-stakes-industries"&gt;Risks and opportunities in high-stakes industries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some AI hallucinations are harmless and rather amusing (the “adding glue to pizza” response, for example), in high-stakes industries, this misinformation can have more serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who are seeking medical or legal advice on Google, which is not recommended but inevitable, can end up with incorrect AI overviews shoved in their faces. And since such answers are prominently featured at the top of the page, they carry unearned authority. One bad answer could lead to poor medical decisions, legal missteps, or financial harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that AI overviews present an opportunity for authoritative, trustworthy sites to be cited more often. For professionals in law, healthcare, and finance, this means it’s important to have content that is accurate, well-structured, and published by credentialed experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news for SEO experts is that organic rankings are no longer the sole focus. The new race is to be featured in the AIO. If a user asking for legal advice can get their answer, whether true or not, without clicking any links, why would they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, if you’re ranking well organically, you have a higher chance of being featured in the AIO. Ahrefs recently found that 76% of AIO citations pull from the top ten results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-law-firm-seo"&gt;Implications for law firm SEO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can law firms and other high-stakes professionals adapt? They need to ensure that content is addressing common questions and doing so in a clear, structured format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of E-E-A-T is alive and well in SEO: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. This content strategy hasn’t gone anywhere and is likely a factor in AIO citations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In legal content, questions like “Do I need a lawyer after a car accident?” can be used as headings, with a clear answer following. Any legal answer that can be cited with a government statute should absolutely do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of gaining authority and trust comes from getting high-quality backlinks. Being cited in trusted sources like legal directories, news sites, or .edu and .gov pages is still an important part of SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEO professionals suggest focusing on both traditional ranking factors and new AIO-specific formats to cover all the bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-seo-pros-should-be-doing-now"&gt;What SEO pros should be doing now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in optimising for AI is to monitor how your site appears in overviews. You can search manually or use tools, but start tracking which queries you appear for and which page or section of your page is cited. You should also look at which page or section of your competitors’ pages are being cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schema, or structured data, is one strategy for trying to get your content into the AIO. It communicates your content to Google in a language it understands more easily and is your best shot at getting rich results. Having FAQ sections on your pages with concise answers and structured data will improve AI accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea to reevaluate which of your current pages are targeting high-intent, high-risk queries. Can you strengthen the answers? Improve readability? Cite more trustworthy sources? Even small edits might make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s AI overviews are raising the bar for content in industries where precision matters. For law firm SEO and other high-stakes verticals, success now means becoming a trustworthy source, not just a top result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms that invest in high-quality content, structure, and authority will be better positioned for an AI-driven search experience, no matter what that looks like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Header-Google-e1753778670635.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve searched anything on Google lately, chances are you’ve seen an AI overview (AIO).

But the company hopes its twist on the technology could help bring cheap, long-duration energy storage to new places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In traditional pumped hydro storage facilities, electric pumps move water uphill, into a natural or manmade body of water. Then, when electricity is needed, that water is released and flows downhill past a turbine, generating electricity. Quidnet’s approach instead pumps water down into impermeable rock formations and keeps it under pressure so it flows up when released. “It’s like pumped hydro, upside down,” says CEO Joe Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quidnet started a six-month test of its technology in late 2024, pressurizing the system. In June, the company was able to discharge 35 megawatt-hours of energy from the well. There was virtually no self-discharge, meaning no energy loss, Zhou says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Inexpensive forms of energy storage that can store electricity for weeks or months could help inconsistent electricity sources like wind and solar go further for the grid. And Quidnet’s approach, which uses commercially available equipment, could be deployed quickly and qualify for federal tax credits to help make it even cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, there’s still a big milestone ahead: turning the pressurized water back into electricity. The company is currently building a facility with the turbines and support equipment to do that—all the components are available to purchase from established companies. “We don’t need to invent new things based on what we’ve already developed today,” Zhou says. “We can now start just deploying at very, very substantial scales.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That process will come with energy losses. Energy storage systems are typically measured by their round-trip efficiency: how much of the electricity that’s put into the system is returned at the end as electricity. Modeling suggests that Quidnet’s technology could reach a maximum efficiency of about 65%, Zhou says, though some design choices made to optimize for economics will likely cause the system to land at roughly 50%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s less efficient than lithium-ion batteries, but long-duration systems, if they’re cheap enough, can operate at low efficiencies and still be useful for the grid, says Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s got to be cost-competitive; it all comes down to that,” Denholm says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries, the fastest-growing technology in energy storage, are the target that new forms of energy storage, like Quidnet’s, must chase. Lithium-ion batteries are about 90% cheaper today than they were 15 years ago. They’ve become a price-competitive alternative to building new natural-gas plants, Denholm says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to competing with batteries, one potential differentiator for Quidnet could be government subsidies. While the Trump administration has clawed back funding for clean energy technologies, there’s still an energy storage tax credit, though recently passed legislation added new supply chain restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Starting in 2026, new energy storage facilities hoping to qualify for tax credits will need to prove that at least 55% of the value of a project’s materials are not from foreign entities of concern. That rules out sourcing batteries from China, which dominates battery production today. Quidnet has a “high level of domestic content” and expects to qualify for tax credits under the new rules, Zhou says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The facility Quidnet is building is a project with utility partner CPS Energy, and it should come online in early 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250728-BatteryStartup_New.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Texas-based startup Quidnet Energy just completed a test showing it can store energy for up to six months by pumping water underground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using water to store electricity is hardly a new concept—pumped hydropower storage has been around for over a century.

But the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won’t come as a surprise, and you’ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When Americans get scammed, they’re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI’s development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC’s actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it’s just the latest in the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In May, Trump signed legislation to protect people from nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, a growing concern for celebrities and everyday people alike as generative video gets more advanced and cheaper to use. The law had bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Now, the White House says it’s concerned about the issues deepfakes could pose for the legal system. For example, it says, “fake evidence could be used to attempt to deny justice to both plaintiffs and defendants.” It calls for new standards for deepfake detection and asks the Department of Justice to create rules around it. Legal experts I’ve spoken with are more concerned with a different problem: Lawyers are adopting AI models that make errors such as citing cases that don’t exist, which judges may not catch. This is not addressed in the action plan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that just days before releasing a plan that targets “malicious deepfakes,” President Trump shared a fake AI-generated video of former president Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, the AI Action Plan affirms what President Trump and those in his orbit have long signaled: It’s the defining social and political weapon of our time. They believe that AI, if harnessed correctly, can help them win everything from culture wars to geopolitical conflicts. The right AI, they argue, will help defeat China. Government pressure on leading companies can force them to purge “woke” ideology from their models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plan includes crowd-pleasers—like cracking down on deepfakes—but overall, it reflects how tech giants have cozied up to the Trump administration.

But the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won’t come as a surprise, and you’ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When Americans get scammed, they’re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI’s development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC’s actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it’s just the latest in the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The White House is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;optimistic about AI for science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The opening to the AI Action Plan describes a future where AI is doing everything from discovering new materials and drugs to “unraveling ancient scrolls once thought unreadable” to making breakthroughs in science and math.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That type of unbounded optimism about AI for scientific discovery echoes what tech companies are promising. Some of that optimism is grounded in reality: AI’s role in predicting protein structures has indeed led to material scientific wins (and just last week, Google DeepMind released a new AI meant to help interpret ancient Latin engravings). But the idea that large language models—essentially very good text prediction machines—will act as scientists in their own right has less merit so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, the plan shows that the Trump administration wants to award money to labs trying to make it a reality, even as it has worked to slash the funding the National Science Foundation makes available to human scientists, some of whom are now struggling to complete their research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And some of the steps the plan proposes are likely to be welcomed by researchers, like funding to build AI systems that are more transparent and interpretable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The White House’s messaging on deepfakes is confused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Compared with President Biden’s executive orders on AI, the new action plan is mostly devoid of anything related to making AI safer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, there’s a notable exception: a section in the plan that takes on the harms posed by deepfakes.

At the same time, domestic firms are hoping to reduce their dependence on US technology. The stakes extend far beyond technological supremacy, with both nations viewing AI dominance as critical to future economic and strategic power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shanghai’s US$139 million AI investment gambit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai has unveiled an ambitious one billion yuan (US$139 million) subsidy programme for its artificial intelligence industry, marking the latest in the technological race as major cities in China engage in fierce AI competition for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive package allocates resources in three key areas: 600 million yuan for computing power subsidies, 300 million yuan for third-party AI model discounts, and 100 million yuan to support companies in procuring training datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme offers subsidy rates ranging from 10% to 100% of contract values for computing facilities, AI models, and datasets, according to documents released by the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatisation. The city plans to offer up to 500 million yuan to new AI research institutions, with funding guaranteed for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of Shanghai’s key advantages in AI development is its strong funding,” said Pan Helin, a member of an expert committee under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. However, Pan noted that Shanghai’s high operating costs often push AI start-ups toward cheaper alternatives like nearby Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nationwide competition heats up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai’s initiative reflects a broader pattern in China, where cities are competing aggressively to establish AI dominance in what has become an intense inter-city competition. Hangzhou has emerged as a particular rival, having announced plans last year to distribute 250 million yuan in computing power subsidies while nurturing its “six little dragons” – a collection of well-known Chinese start-ups, including AI player DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inter-city rivalry extends beyond Shanghai and Hangzhou, with Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Beijing also introducing similar support measures. This situation demonstrates how artificial intelligence has become a strategic priority at multiple levels of Chinese government – domestic AI competition in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump’s AI strategy maintains pressure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of Shanghai’s announcement coincides with the Trump administration’s comprehensive AI Action Plan, unveiled on July 23. The 28-page strategy maintains tight restrictions on key technologies while accelerating deregulation and infrastructure support for US AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump described the plan as “a policy of the United States to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,” emphasising America’s intention to become an “AI export powerhouse” and maintain national security protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan tasks the US Commerce Department with closing loopholes in current export restrictions, boosting oversight of end users abroad, and a plan to explore geolocation tools to block access to “countries of concern” like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;China’s self-reliance strategy shows results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite US restrictions, analysts predict significant growth for China’s domestic AI industry. Bernstein analysts led by Lin Qingyuan forecast that domestic chips will capture 55% of China’s AI accelerator market by 2027, up dramatically from just 17% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Export controls have created a unique opportunity for domestic AI chip vendors, as they are not competing with the most advanced global alternatives,” the Bernstein research note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth reflects ongoing technological progress, with Chinese companies increasingly matching the performance of downgraded chips sold to China. Huawei’s Ascend 910C now reaches approximately 65% of Nvidia’s supreme H100 capacity, though its computing power remains limited by lack of direct compatibility with Nvidia’s CUDA software platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Geopolitical implications and future outlook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bo Zhengyuan of Plenum, an independent China-focused research platform, argues that Trump’s approach represents a shift from Biden’s containment strategy to more direct competition. “So far, the ‘yard’ hasn’t gotten any smaller,” Bo noted, according to a &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; article, referring to export control scope. “What’s different is the rhetoric – it’s now more head-to-head than containment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI competition between China and the US appears set to intensify further, so much so that at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation to ensure AI does not become an “exclusive game” accessible only to a select few – a clear reference to US restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neither US pressure nor Chinese subsidies guarantees clear winners in this technological race. “AI isn’t something that can be built overnight through policy support alone – it’s a long game shaped by engineering, talent, and infrastructure,” Bo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With China’s data resources, algorithms, and AI talent remaining competitive with the US despite chip restrictions, the outcome of this technological competition may ultimately depend on which approach – American technological restrictions or Chinese self-reliance investments – proves more effective in driving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There won’t be a clear winner or loser in the next decade,” Bo concluded, suggesting that this technological rivalry will define the AI landscape for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Ren Zhengfei: China’s AI future and Huawei’s long game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you may have missed about Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The executive orders and announcements coming from the White House since Donald Trump returned to office have painted an ambitious vision for America’s AI future, but the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed.

The agent can browse websites, analyze data, create presentations, write code, and coordinate work across an organization’s entire technology stack without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other AI chatbots can tell you what to do. Action Agent does it,” said May Habib, Writer’s CEO and co-founder. “It’s the difference between getting a research report and having your entire sales pipeline updated and acted upon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch positions San Francisco-based Writer as a formidable competitor to Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the lucrative enterprise market, where companies are racing to deploy AI systems that can automate knowledge work. Unlike consumer-focused AI tools, Writer’s agent includes enterprise-grade security controls and audit trails that regulated industries like banking and healthcare require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-writer-s-super-agent-executes-tasks-other-ai-can-only-describe"&gt;How Writer’s super agent executes tasks other AI can only describe&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s Action Agent fundamentally differs from existing AI assistants by operating at what the company calls “level four orchestration” — the highest tier of AI automation. Most current enterprise AI tools operate at levels one or two, handling basic tasks like answering questions or retrieving documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is most of the market is anywhere between one to two,” explained Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer’s head of product, in an interview with VentureBeat. “What we’ve done here is full orchestration. This is an agent that calls agents, writes its own tools when needed, can execute on that with full visibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinction goes far beyond simple automation capabilities. While traditional AI assistants like ChatGPT or Copilot are “very much built for like a Q and A experience,” Shetrit noted, Action Agent is designed for execution. “The difference is, one is not just about like, let me do this back and forth brainstorming, but more like, once and if I want to do the brainstorming, I can also act on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agent operates within its own isolated virtual computer for each session, allowing it to independently browse web pages, build software, solve technical problems, and execute complex multi-step plans. When asked to perform a product analysis, for example, Action Agent will automatically process thousands of customer reviews, perform sentiment analysis, identify themes, and generate a presentation — all without human guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system’s capabilities extend to generating its own tools when existing ones prove insufficient. “It can action whether or not it has MCP or any tool access, because it can just generate its own tools on the fly for the purpose of the task,” Shetrit explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a demonstration, Shetrit showed the agent conducting clinical trial site selection — a process that typically requires weeks of human research. The agent systematically analyzed demographics across multiple cities, ranked locations by suitability criteria, and generated comprehensive reports with supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is weeks worth of work by these companies,” Shetrit noted. “It’s not something that’s trivial to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breaking-benchmarks-action-agent-outperforms-openai-on-key-tests"&gt;Breaking benchmarks: Action agent outperforms OpenAI on key tests&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s claims about the agent’s capabilities are backed by impressive benchmark results. Action Agent scored 61% on GAIA Level 3, the most challenging benchmark for AI agent performance, outperforming competing systems including OpenAI’s Deep Research. The agent also achieved a 10.4% score on the CUB (Computer Use Benchmark) leaderboard, making it the top performer for computer and browser use tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate the agent’s ability to handle complex reasoning tasks that have traditionally stumped AI systems. GAIA Level 3 tests require agents to navigate multiple tools, synthesize information from various sources, and complete multi-step workflows — precisely the kind of work that enterprises need automated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The performance stems from Writer’s Palmyra X5 model, which features a one-million-token context window — enough to process hundreds of pages of documents simultaneously while maintaining coherence across complex tasks. This massive context capability allows the agent to work with entire codebases, lengthy research reports, and comprehensive datasets without losing track of the overall objective.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Writer’s enterprise focus sets it apart in a market dominated by consumer-oriented AI companies attempting to adapt their products for business use. The company built Action Agent on its existing enterprise platform, which already serves hundreds of major corporations including Accenture, Vanguard, Qualcomm, Uber, and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinction proves crucial for enterprise adoption. While consumer AI tools often operate as “black boxes” with limited transparency, Writer’s system provides complete audit trails showing exactly how the agent reached its conclusions and what actions it took.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shetrit emphasized this transparency as essential for regulated industries: “If you start talking about some of the largest companies in the world, whether it’s banks or pharmaceutical companies or healthcare companies, it’s unacceptable that you don’t know how these autonomous agents are behaving and what they’re doing, and you can audit and have a few full visibility on what, what the hell is happening in that in that box.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system provides “full traceability, auditability and visibility,” allowing IT administrators to set fine-grained permissions controlling which tools each agent can access and what actions they can perform.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Action Agent’s ability to connect with over 600 enterprise tools represents a significant technical achievement. The agent uses Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI tool integration, but Writer has enhanced it with enterprise-grade controls that address security and governance concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer has been working closely with Amazon Web Services and other industry players to bring MCP to enterprise standards. “There’s still place to bring it to enterprise grade,” Shetrit noted, referencing recent issues with MCP implementations at companies like Asana and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s approach allows granular control that extends beyond simple user permissions. “It’s not just by a user. It will also have it by the specific agent,” Shetrit explained. “So as an IT persona or a security persona, I have the controls I need to feel comfortable with this data access.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, administrators can permit certain agents to publish messages to Slack while preventing them from deleting messages. “You need that fine grained control, and that’s something we’re baking in as part of the system,” Shetrit said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company pre-announces support for over 600 different tools, with each tool offering fine-grained control both at the integration level and for specific agents. This capability allows Action Agent to coordinate work across an organization’s entire technology ecosystem, from customer relationship management systems to financial databases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-ai-agents-challenge-traditional-software-pricing-models"&gt;Free AI agents challenge traditional software pricing models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s decision to offer Action Agent free to existing customers challenges traditional software pricing models and reflects broader shifts in the AI industry. The move comes despite the significant computational costs associated with the agent’s extensive token usage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Token pricing is extremely problematic when you start thinking about enterprises,” Shetrit explained. “They need a budget line item. They need to figure out the cost structure. This highly variable cost model does not work for these companies, and that is why we’ve been moving away from this for a while now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strategy reflects Writer’s confidence in its cost-efficient model development. The company spent just $700,000 to train its Palmyra X4 model, compared to an estimated $4.6 million for a similarly sized OpenAI model. This efficiency stems from Writer’s use of synthetic data and innovative training techniques that reduce computational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s reasoning for the free offering goes beyond competitive positioning. “We think this shows the full value of the ecosystem and the platform, and really starts delivering on the promise of AI,” Shetrit said. Internal users have reported being more excited about this AI product than any previous AI tool they’ve used, including other copilot systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-ai-market-heats-up-as-startups-target-microsoft-and-google"&gt;Enterprise AI market heats up as startups target Microsoft and Google&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s Action Agent launch escalates competition in the rapidly expanding enterprise AI market, projected to grow from $58 billion to $114 billion by 2027. The company competes directly with Microsoft’s Copilot suite, Google’s enterprise AI offerings, and OpenAI’s business products, but targets a different market segment with its enterprise-first approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The competitive positioning reflects a broader industry split between companies building general-purpose AI systems and those focusing specifically on enterprise needs. Writer’s approach prioritizes security, governance, and reliability over raw capability, betting that enterprise customers will choose specialized tools over consumer products adapted for business use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of their focus is on the consumer realm versus us, which was like, this is not where we’re at,” Shetrit emphasized regarding competitors. “We are fully on the Enterprise B to B side.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This focus has paid off financially. Writer raised $200 million in Series C funding in November 2024 at a $1.9 billion valuation, nearly quadrupling its previous valuation. The round was co-led by Premji Invest, Radical Ventures, and ICONIQ Growth, with participation from major enterprise players including Salesforce Ventures, Adobe Ventures, and IBM Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-automation-to-transformation-how-ai-will-reshape-corporate-work"&gt;From automation to transformation: How AI will reshape corporate work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s vision extends beyond current automation to fundamentally reshape how enterprises operate. The company identifies two clusters of use cases emerging in large organizations: traditional “90% workflow, 10% AI” optimization and new “90% AI, 10% workflow” experiences that unlock entirely new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Each employee will have a thing like this next to them that helps them do their work, helps them automate a lot of it, so you can do much higher leverage work across the organization,” Shetrit predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This transformation addresses a critical shift in enterprise software expectations. As employees become accustomed to sophisticated AI tools in their personal lives, enterprise software must match or exceed that quality. “You cannot afford for enterprise software to not be as good, and in a lot of cases, significantly better,” Shetrit noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shift is already changing internal dynamics at Writer itself. “Historically, as a PM, I can say that execution was the bottleneck. So I can always say no, because I don’t have capacity. Capacity is no longer the bottleneck,” Shetrit explained. When his product managers claim they don’t have time for projects, he now uses Action Agent to generate “at least 80% and 70% and 90% of the work for them so they can start working on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This represents a fundamental change from “scarcity to an abundance mentality” that will require “a lot of retraining element that has to happen within the org.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-writer-s-collaboration-with-uber-to-build-real-world-ai-agents"&gt;Inside Writer’s collaboration with Uber to build real-world AI agents&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s collaboration with Uber on Action Agent development illustrates how the company leverages customer relationships to improve its technology. Uber’s AI Solutions team provided operational expertise for scaling high-quality annotations across complex enterprise domains, while simultaneously validating the agent’s capabilities in real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our collaboration with WRITER allowed us to contribute our deep operational expertise in high-quality data annotation to help shape an agent capable of tackling the most complex enterprise challenges,” said Megha Yethadka, GM and Head of Uber AI Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This partnership model allows Writer to develop agents that solve actual enterprise problems rather than theoretical use cases. The approach has generated diverse applications across industries, from HR candidate sourcing and securities analysis to clinical trial site selection and competitive intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shetrit noted that customer creativity continues to surprise the team: “I’m sure, because that’s the nature of platform and technology, is if we have this conversation again in a week after tomorrow, I’ll have completely different use cases, because our customers will be very, very creative in how they use them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-rollout-timeline-and-enterprise-adoption-strategy"&gt;What’s next: Rollout timeline and enterprise adoption strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer plans to expand Action Agent’s capabilities significantly over the coming weeks. The company will add connections to 80 enterprise platforms and third-party data providers like PitchBook and FactSet, enabling access to the full suite of 600+ agent tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rollout strategy reflects lessons learned from enterprise AI deployments. Rather than launching with full capabilities, Writer is starting with core functionality and gradually adding integrations based on customer feedback and real-world testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Action Agent is available immediately in beta to Writer’s existing customer base, with a 14-day trial available for new users. The gradual rollout allows the company to refine the system based on enterprise feedback while maintaining the security and reliability standards that regulated industries require.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The launch signals a pivotal moment in the enterprise AI revolution, where autonomous agents are moving from experimental curiosities to mission-critical business tools. As traditional software vendors scramble to add AI features to existing products, Writer’s agent-first approach may determine which companies successfully navigate the transition from human-driven to AI-augmented work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most telling sign of this shift came from Shetrit himself during the interview: “We will all become, you know, quote, unquote, managers of these fleet of agents, whether they’re humans or synthetic agents.” In this future, the companies that learn to orchestrate AI agents alongside human workers may find themselves with an insurmountable advantage over those still clinging to purely human-driven processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:shortcode --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Writer, the enterprise artificial intelligence company valued at $1.9 billion, launched an autonomous “super agent” Tuesday that can independently execute complex, multi-step business tasks across hundreds of software platforms — marking a significant escalation in the corporate AI arms race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Action Agent represents a fundamental shift from AI chatbots that simply answer questions to systems that can autonomously complete entire projects. The agent can browse websites, analyze data, create presentations, write code, and coordinate work across an organization’s entire technology stack without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other AI chatbots can tell you what to do. Action Agent does it,” said May Habib, Writer’s CEO and co-founder. “It’s the difference between getting a research report and having your entire sales pipeline updated and acted upon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch positions San Francisco-based Writer as a formidable competitor to Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the lucrative enterprise market, where companies are racing to deploy AI systems that can automate knowledge work. Unlike consumer-focused AI tools, Writer’s agent includes enterprise-grade security controls and audit trails that regulated industries like banking and healthcare require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase of AI is here - are you ready? Join leaders from Block, GSK, and SAP for an exclusive look at how autonomous agents are reshaping enterprise workflows - from real-time decision-making to end-to-end automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-writer-s-super-agent-executes-tasks-other-ai-can-only-describe"&gt;How Writer’s super agent executes tasks other AI can only describe&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s Action Agent fundamentally differs from existing AI assistants by operating at what the company calls “level four orchestration” — the highest tier of AI automation. Most current enterprise AI tools operate at levels one or two, handling basic tasks like answering questions or retrieving documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is most of the market is anywhere between one to two,” explained Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer’s head of product, in an interview with VentureBeat. “What we’ve done here is full orchestration. This is an agent that calls agents, writes its own tools when needed, can execute on that with full visibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinction goes far beyond simple automation capabilities. While traditional AI assistants like ChatGPT or Copilot are “very much built for like a Q and A experience,” Shetrit noted, Action Agent is designed for execution. “The difference is, one is not just about like, let me do this back and forth brainstorming, but more like, once and if I want to do the brainstorming, I can also act on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agent operates within its own isolated virtual computer for each session, allowing it to independently browse web pages, build software, solve technical problems, and execute complex multi-step plans. When asked to perform a product analysis, for example, Action Agent will automatically process thousands of customer reviews, perform sentiment analysis, identify themes, and generate a presentation — all without human guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system’s capabilities extend to generating its own tools when existing ones prove insufficient. “It can action whether or not it has MCP or any tool access, because it can just generate its own tools on the fly for the purpose of the task,” Shetrit explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a demonstration, Shetrit showed the agent conducting clinical trial site selection — a process that typically requires weeks of human research. The agent systematically analyzed demographics across multiple cities, ranked locations by suitability criteria, and generated comprehensive reports with supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is weeks worth of work by these companies,” Shetrit noted. “It’s not something that’s trivial to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breaking-benchmarks-action-agent-outperforms-openai-on-key-tests"&gt;Breaking benchmarks: Action agent outperforms OpenAI on key tests&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s claims about the agent’s capabilities are backed by impressive benchmark results. Action Agent scored 61% on GAIA Level 3, the most challenging benchmark for AI agent performance, outperforming competing systems including OpenAI’s Deep Research. The agent also achieved a 10.4% score on the CUB (Computer Use Benchmark) leaderboard, making it the top performer for computer and browser use tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate the agent’s ability to handle complex reasoning tasks that have traditionally stumped AI systems. GAIA Level 3 tests require agents to navigate multiple tools, synthesize information from various sources, and complete multi-step workflows — precisely the kind of work that enterprises need automated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The performance stems from Writer’s Palmyra X5 model, which features a one-million-token context window — enough to process hundreds of pages of documents simultaneously while maintaining coherence across complex tasks. This massive context capability allows the agent to work with entire codebases, lengthy research reports, and comprehensive datasets without losing track of the overall objective.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Writer’s enterprise focus sets it apart in a market dominated by consumer-oriented AI companies attempting to adapt their products for business use. The company built Action Agent on its existing enterprise platform, which already serves hundreds of major corporations including Accenture, Vanguard, Qualcomm, Uber, and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinction proves crucial for enterprise adoption. While consumer AI tools often operate as “black boxes” with limited transparency, Writer’s system provides complete audit trails showing exactly how the agent reached its conclusions and what actions it took.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shetrit emphasized this transparency as essential for regulated industries: “If you start talking about some of the largest companies in the world, whether it’s banks or pharmaceutical companies or healthcare companies, it’s unacceptable that you don’t know how these autonomous agents are behaving and what they’re doing, and you can audit and have a few full visibility on what, what the hell is happening in that in that box.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system provides “full traceability, auditability and visibility,” allowing IT administrators to set fine-grained permissions controlling which tools each agent can access and what actions they can perform.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Action Agent’s ability to connect with over 600 enterprise tools represents a significant technical achievement. The agent uses Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI tool integration, but Writer has enhanced it with enterprise-grade controls that address security and governance concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer has been working closely with Amazon Web Services and other industry players to bring MCP to enterprise standards. “There’s still place to bring it to enterprise grade,” Shetrit noted, referencing recent issues with MCP implementations at companies like Asana and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s approach allows granular control that extends beyond simple user permissions. “It’s not just by a user. It will also have it by the specific agent,” Shetrit explained. “So as an IT persona or a security persona, I have the controls I need to feel comfortable with this data access.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, administrators can permit certain agents to publish messages to Slack while preventing them from deleting messages. “You need that fine grained control, and that’s something we’re baking in as part of the system,” Shetrit said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company pre-announces support for over 600 different tools, with each tool offering fine-grained control both at the integration level and for specific agents. This capability allows Action Agent to coordinate work across an organization’s entire technology ecosystem, from customer relationship management systems to financial databases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-free-ai-agents-challenge-traditional-software-pricing-models"&gt;Free AI agents challenge traditional software pricing models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Writer’s decision to offer Action Agent free to existing customers challenges traditional software pricing models and reflects broader shifts in the AI industry. The move comes despite the significant computational costs associated with the agent’s extensive token usage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Token pricing is extremely problematic when you start thinking about enterprises,” Shetrit explained. “They need a budget line item. They need to figure out the cost structure. This highly variable cost model does not work for these companies, and that is why we’ve been moving away from this for a while now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strategy reflects Writer’s confidence in its cost-efficient model development. The company spent just $700,000 to train its Palmyra X4 model, compared to an estimated $4.6 million for a similarly sized OpenAI model.

With 14 states now operating paid leave programs and six more considering legislation, distributed workforces face a patchwork of rules that vary not just by state, but by county and city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Leave is complicated — and stressful,” explained Deborah Hanus, Sparrow’s CEO and co-founder, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “It touches so many aspects of the company — legal compliance, insurance, state agencies, payroll, HRBPs, managers and employees. Everything is always changing, and no one has the data they need when they need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has intensified dramatically since the pandemic accelerated remote work adoption. What was manageable when employees worked from a single office has become nearly impossible to navigate manually across multiple jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparrow’s growth metrics underscore the urgency companies feel around this problem. The company has grown revenue 14x since raising its Series A in 2021, now serving more than 1,000 customers including OpenAI, Reddit, Chime, and Oura. The platform manages leave for over 500,000 employees and has processed more than 2 million days of leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most telling is the financial impact: Sparrow has saved customers more than $200 million in payroll costs by ensuring employees receive proper wage replacement from state agencies and insurance providers — money that would otherwise come from company coffers when paperwork errors prevent benefit claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Using Sparrow actually saves our customers money, because the default is people are making mistakes on their paperwork. They’re not getting paid properly, and then usually their employer is making up the difference,” Hanus said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One customer, which Hanus declined to name, paid Sparrow roughly $250,000 in its first year but saved $2.5 million in payroll costs — a 10x return on investment simply by ensuring compliance paperwork was filed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional leave management requires HR teams to navigate a maze of federal regulations like FMLA alongside varying state programs, insurance providers, and medical documentation. The process involves coordinating between employees, managers, payroll teams, legal counsel, and multiple external agencies — often using spreadsheets and email threads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before Sparrow, we were managing all of our leaves through an Excel spreadsheet,” said Sara Marzitelli, Vice President and Head of People at SonderMind, a mental health company that experienced 2,289% growth over three years. “It was hectic. Information wasn’t always up to date and we were missing key pieces of data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sonya Miller, VP People Business Partner at Eightfold.ai, an AI-powered talent intelligence platform, echoed similar challenges. “Before using Sparrow, we were keeping up with constantly evolving state programs and manually tracking absences, which frequently resulted in us overspending without realizing it,” Miller told VentureBeat. “Hiring a leave management partner to save money may seem counterintuitive, but that is precisely what happened. Sparrow helped us save time and money by streamlining the entire procedure and guaranteeing compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sparrow’s AI-powered platform consolidates this fragmented process by ingesting data from insurance providers, state agencies, and medical providers into a single system. The technology automates form completion, tracks deadlines, calculates wage replacement amounts, and manages communication between all parties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest problem is not having the right information in the right place,” Hanus explained. “We’re able to take all of that information across the insurance providers, medical providers, state agencies, and we are putting that all into one system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s compliance engine stays current with constantly changing regulations across all 50 states plus Canada, automatically updating processes when new legislation passes. This is critical as compliance requirements often differ not just in policy but in implementation details that can vary significantly between jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sparrow-pairs-artificial-intelligence-with-human-specialists"&gt;Why Sparrow pairs artificial intelligence with human specialists&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike pure software solutions, Sparrow combines AI automation with dedicated human specialists who handle complex cases and provide employee support. Each employee taking leave gets paired with a Sparrow Leave Specialist who manages their case from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know how to use AI when it needs to be used, but there are some moments where maybe the AI is not quite ready for it,” Hanus said. “These are very sensitive moments. You don’t want to give people wrong information.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This hybrid approach has generated exceptional customer satisfaction. Sparrow maintains a Net Promoter Score above 60, sometimes reaching 100, compared to industry averages in the negative range for insurance-related products. Customer retention exceeds 90%, with net revenue retention above 110%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human element proves especially valuable in complex scenarios. “Maybe someone was in a car accident, they’re in a coma, and you’re dealing with their spouse, so they don’t have access to any of their accounts,” Hanus said. “Some of these situations just get complicated enough that sometimes you do actually want human intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miller from Eightfold.ai praised the platform’s user experience. “Sparrow gives our staff members the freedom to manage their own leave. We also don’t have to worry about the specifics because it guarantees state-specific accuracy and compliance,” she said. “Additionally, the dashboard is simple to use and intuitive for HR, business partners, and employees. Filing paperwork for disability insurance and other state funding for the employee is a huge benefit for both our employees and Eightfold with Sparrow, in contrast to other leave management vendors we spoke with.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-customers-save-millions-through-proper-leave-compliance"&gt;Enterprise customers save millions through proper leave compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customer case studies reveal the substantial financial impact of proper leave management. Wish, the mobile commerce platform with 850 employees globally, saved more than $600,000 in 2023 alone by utilizing wage replacement programs properly managed by Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We decided to partner with Sparrow to give employees a seamless leave experience, and reduce the workload for HR Ops and Payroll,” said Pauline Lam, People Operations Manager at Wish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At SonderMind, the transformation freed up strategic capacity for the HR team. “We’ve gotten so much time back with Sparrow, which means it’s a major cost savings as well,” Marzitelli said. “Working with Sparrow has given us more time to focus on strategic initiatives that help us attract new talent and improve employee retention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The time savings prove substantial. At Gong, the revenue intelligence platform, Senior Manager of Benefits Programs Karen Hoang reports spending “at least 30% less time on leave-related interactions thanks to Sparrow.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Eightfold.ai, Miller highlighted both employee and operational benefits. “The biggest benefits for employees have been the simplicity of use, the feeling of privacy, and the genuine support they received during their leave,” she said. “Time, energy, and money have been saved for our team, and everything is easy to manage thanks to the dashboard.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-state-by-state-regulations-create-perfect-storm-for-hr-technology"&gt;State-by-state regulations create perfect storm for HR technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The funding comes at an inflection point for workplace leave policies. While federal paid leave legislation has stalled, states have filled the gap with their own programs. Since 2019, multiple states have launched paid family and medical leave programs, with more in development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Leave was not always this complex,” Hanus noted. “Thirty years ago, there were really no regulations related to leave. Then we got FMLA in the 90s. Then for 20 years, there were no more regulations related to leave. It’s really in the last 15 years where there’s been all this interest in federal paid leave.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The complexity extends beyond state programs. Companies must navigate short-term disability insurance, workers’ compensation, and various federal protections while ensuring consistent policy application across their workforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When teams became much more distributed in 2019 and 2020, this went from being a difficult compliance problem to an absolutely insurmountable problem,” Hanus said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-global-expansion-plans-target-international-compliance-markets"&gt;Global expansion plans target international compliance markets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sparrow already operates in the United States and Canada, with plans to expand its compliance capabilities internationally. The company offers a global leave solution that manages tracking and communication for leaves worldwide, though without the detailed compliance automation available domestically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today, if someone at a company like Samsung says ‘We’re going to start hiring in France,’ HR panics,” Hanus said. “They usually have to go find a local employment lawyer who may or may not be able to provide information in the language that HR speaks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Series B funding will enable Sparrow to expand beyond leave management into adjacent compliance areas like accommodations and immigration — other high-touch, regulation-heavy processes that burden HR teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our core competency is making sure that everyone has the right information at the right time, and all that data is in one place,” Hanus said. “Really, what our core competency is within this is these sort of high touch compliant moments in compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-usage-based-pricing-model-drives-six-figure-enterprise-deals"&gt;Usage-based pricing model drives six-figure enterprise deals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sparrow operates on a usage-based pricing model, charging companies for each employee leave rather than a flat subscription fee. Roughly half of the company’s revenue comes from six-figure deals, indicating strong enterprise adoption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company plans to introduce subscription-based pricing for new products as it expands into additional compliance areas. This hybrid approach allows smaller companies to access the platform while scaling with larger enterprise clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re using it, you’re paying for it. If you’re not, you’re not,” Hanus explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hr-industry-leaders-validate-urgent-need-for-automated-solutions"&gt;HR industry leaders validate urgent need for automated solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The complexity Sparrow addresses resonates throughout the HR industry. Andy Biladeau, Chief Transformation Officer at the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), noted that among the organization’s 325,000 members, “Every year, we receive over 60,000 calls, and for more than a decade, leave management has consistently been a leading concern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake Waterman Managing Director Matt Walsh, who led the investment, sees Sparrow addressing “one of the most complex and underserved areas of HR by utilizing AI to automate the manual, error-prone tasks that companies and employees encounter today.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing aligns with broader workforce trends. “As the future of work demands more flexibility and support for employees, Sparrow is uniquely positioned to become the category leader in this essential part of the human capital management stack,” Walsh said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-billion-dollar-opportunity-hidden-in-hr-s-biggest-headache"&gt;The billion-dollar opportunity hidden in HR’s biggest headache&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As more states pass leave legislation and remote work becomes permanent, the administrative burden on HR teams will only intensify. Sparrow’s rapid growth demonstrates that companies are willing to pay significant sums to outsource this complexity rather than risk compliance failures or employee dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s success also highlights a broader trend: specialized AI solutions that combine automation with human expertise are emerging as the preferred approach for handling sensitive workplace issues. Unlike purely automated systems, this hybrid model builds trust while delivering efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Sparrow, the challenge now lies in scaling its operations while maintaining the high-touch service that has driven customer loyalty. With regulatory complexity showing no signs of abating and distributed workforces becoming the norm, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on what may be HR’s most persistent pain point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, in a world where taking time off work has become a compliance minefield, the company that can make leave truly stress-free may have found the ultimate competitive moat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:shortcode --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sparrow, the employee leave management technology company, announced Tuesday it raised $35 million in Series B funding led by Silver Lake Waterman, bringing the company’s total investment to $64 million as it capitalizes on the growing complexity of workplace leave compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding comes as companies grapple with an explosion of state and local leave regulations that have transformed what was once a straightforward HR process into a compliance nightmare. With 14 states now operating paid leave programs and six more considering legislation, distributed workforces face a patchwork of rules that vary not just by state, but by county and city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Leave is complicated — and stressful,” explained Deborah Hanus, Sparrow’s CEO and co-founder, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “It touches so many aspects of the company — legal compliance, insurance, state agencies, payroll, HRBPs, managers and employees. Everything is always changing, and no one has the data they need when they need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has intensified dramatically since the pandemic accelerated remote work adoption. What was manageable when employees worked from a single office has become nearly impossible to navigate manually across multiple jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparrow’s growth metrics underscore the urgency companies feel around this problem. The company has grown revenue 14x since raising its Series A in 2021, now serving more than 1,000 customers including OpenAI, Reddit, Chime, and Oura. The platform manages leave for over 500,000 employees and has processed more than 2 million days of leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most telling is the financial impact: Sparrow has saved customers more than $200 million in payroll costs by ensuring employees receive proper wage replacement from state agencies and insurance providers — money that would otherwise come from company coffers when paperwork errors prevent benefit claims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Using Sparrow actually saves our customers money, because the default is people are making mistakes on their paperwork. They’re not getting paid properly, and then usually their employer is making up the difference,” Hanus said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One customer, which Hanus declined to name, paid Sparrow roughly $250,000 in its first year but saved $2.5 million in payroll costs — a 10x return on investment simply by ensuring compliance paperwork was filed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional leave management requires HR teams to navigate a maze of federal regulations like FMLA alongside varying state programs, insurance providers, and medical documentation. The process involves coordinating between employees, managers, payroll teams, legal counsel, and multiple external agencies — often using spreadsheets and email threads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before Sparrow, we were managing all of our leaves through an Excel spreadsheet,” said Sara Marzitelli, Vice President and Head of People at SonderMind, a mental health company that experienced 2,289% growth over three years. “It was hectic. Information wasn’t always up to date and we were missing key pieces of data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sonya Miller, VP People Business Partner at Eightfold.ai, an AI-powered talent intelligence platform, echoed similar challenges. “Before using Sparrow, we were keeping up with constantly evolving state programs and manually tracking absences, which frequently resulted in us overspending without realizing it,” Miller told VentureBeat. “Hiring a leave management partner to save money may seem counterintuitive, but that is precisely what happened.

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More developers than ever before are using AI tools to both assist and generate code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While enterprise AI adoption accelerates, new data from Stack Overflow’s 2025 Developer Survey exposes a critical blind spot: the mounting technical debt created by AI tools that generate “almost right” solutions, potentially undermining the productivity gains they promise to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey is one of the largest such reports in any given year. In 2024 the report found that developers were not worried that AI would still their jobs. Somewhat ironically,&amp;nbsp; Stack Overflow was initially negatively impacted by the growth of gen AI, with declining traffic and resulting layoffs in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 survey of over 49,000 developers across 177 countries reveals a troubling paradox in enterprise AI adoption. AI usage continues climbing—84% of developers now use or plan to use AI tools, up from 76% in 2024. Yet trust in these tools has cratered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most surprising findings was a significant shift in developer preferences for AI compared to previous years, while most developers use AI, they like it less and trust it less this year,” Erin Yepis, Senior Analyst for Market Research and Insights at Stack Overflow, told VentureBeat. “This response is surprising because with all of the investment in and focus on AI in tech news, I would expect that the trust would grow as the technology gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell the story. Only 33% of developers trust AI accuracy in 2025, down from 43% in 2024 and 42% in 2023. AI favorability dropped from 77% in 2023 to 72% in 2024 to just 60% this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the survey data reveals a more urgent concern for technical decision-makers. Developers cite “AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite” as their top frustration—66% report this problem. Meanwhile, 45% say debugging AI-generated code takes more time than expected. AI tools promise productivity gains but may actually create new categories of technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-almost-right-phenomenon-disrupts-developer-workflows"&gt;The ‘almost right’ phenomenon disrupts developer workflows&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI tools don’t just produce obviously broken code. They generate plausible solutions that require significant developer intervention to become production-ready. This creates a particularly insidious productivity problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI tools seem to have a universal promise of saving time and increasing productivity, but developers are spending time addressing the unintended breakdowns in the workflow caused by AI,” Yepis explained. “Most developers say AI tools do not address complexity, only 29% believed AI tools could handle complex problems this year, down from 35% last year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike obviously broken code that developers quickly identify and discard, “almost right” solutions demand careful analysis. Developers must understand what’s wrong and how to fix it. Many report it would be faster to write the code from scratch than to debug and correct AI-generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The workflow disruption extends beyond individual coding tasks. The survey found 54% of developers use six or more tools to complete their jobs. This adds context-switching overhead to an already complex development process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enterprise-governance-frameworks-trail-behind-adoption"&gt;Enterprise governance frameworks trail behind adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapid AI adoption has outpaced enterprise governance capabilities. Organizations now face potential security and technical debt risks they haven’t fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vibe coding requires a higher level of trust in the AI’s output, and sacrifices confidence and potential security concerns in the code for a faster turnaround,” Ben Matthews, Senior Director of Engineering at Stack Overflow, told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers largely reject vibe coding for professional work, with 77% noting that it’s not part of their professional development process. Yet the survey reveals gaps in how enterprises manage AI-generated code quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthews warns that AI coding tools powered by LLMs can and do produce mistakes. He noted that while knowledgeable developers are able to identify and test vulnerable code themselves, LLMs are sometimes simply unable to even register any mistakes they may produce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security risks compound these quality issues. The survey data shows that when developers would still turn to humans for coding help, 61.7% cite “ethical or security concerns about code” as a key reason. This suggests that AI tools introduce integration challenges around data access, performance and security that organizations are still learning to manage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-still-use-stack-overflow-and-other-human-sources-of-expertise"&gt;Developers still use Stack Overflow and other human sources of expertise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite declining trust, developers aren’t abandoning AI tools. They’re developing more sophisticated strategies for integrating them into workflows. The survey shows 69% of developers spent time learning new coding techniques or programming languages in the past year. Of these, 44% used AI-enabled tools for learning, up from 37% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with the rise of vibe coding and AI, the survey data shows that developers maintain strong connections to human expertise and community resources. Stack Overflow remains the top community platform at 84% usage. GitHub follows at 67% and YouTube at 61%. Most tellingly, 89% of developers visit Stack Overflow multiple times per month. Among these, 35% turn to the platform specifically after encountering issues with AI responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although we have seen a decline in traffic, in no way is it as dramatic as some would indicate,” Jody Bailey, Chief Product &amp;amp; Technology Officer, told VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, Bailey did admit that times change and the day-to-day needs of users are not the same as they were 16 years ago when Stack Overflow got started. He noted that there is not a single site or company not seeing a shift in where users come from or how they are now engaging with gen AI tools. That shift is causing Stack Overflow to critically reassess how it gauges success in the modern digital age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The future vitality of the internet and the broader tech ecosystem will no longer be solely defined by metrics of success outlined in the 90s or early 00s,” Bailey said. “Instead, the emphasis is increasingly on the caliber of data, the reliability of information, and the incredibly vital role of expert communities and individuals in meticulously creating, sharing and curating knowledge. “&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-recommendations-for-technical-decision-makers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic recommendations for technical decision-makers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Stack Overflow data suggests several key considerations for enterprise teams evaluating AI development tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in debugging and code review capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: With 45% of developers reporting increased debugging time for AI code, organizations need stronger code review processes. They need debugging tools specifically designed for AI-generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain human expertise pipelines&lt;/strong&gt;: Continued reliance on community platforms and human consultation shows that AI tools amplify rather than replace the need for experienced developers. These experts can identify and correct AI-generated code issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement staged AI adoption&lt;/strong&gt;: Successful AI adoption requires careful integration with existing tools and processes rather than wholesale replacement of development workflows. This allows developers to leverage AI strengths while mitigating “almost right” solution risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on AI tool literacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Developers using AI tools daily show 88% favorability compared to 64% for weekly users. This suggests proper training and integration strategies significantly impact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises looking to lead in AI-driven development, this data indicates competitive advantage will come not from AI adoption speed, but from developing superior capabilities in AI-human workflow integration and AI-generated code quality management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations that solve the “almost right” problem,turning AI tools into reliable productivity multipliers rather than sources of technical debt,will gain significant advantages in development speed and code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More developers than ever before are using AI tools to both assist and generate code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While enterprise AI adoption accelerates, new data from Stack Overflow’s 2025 Developer Survey exposes a critical blind spot: the mounting technical debt created by AI tools that generate “almost right” solutions, potentially undermining the productivity gains they promise to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey is one of the largest such reports in any given year.

If the deal goes through, it would clear a key hurdle in OpenAI’s transition toward becoming a fully commercial enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The companies have been negotiating regularly, and they could come to an agreement in a few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing three anonymous sources. The report cited some of the sources as saying that while the talks have been positive, other roadblocks could emerge in the form of regulatory scrutiny and Elon Musk’s lawsuit to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently structured as a mission-driven nonprofit that oversees a capped for-profit company — a setup that’s meant to limit how fully it can commercialize or raise money. That structure hasn’t stopped it from raising billions and operating like a traditional tech company, but OpenAI still wants to shake off its constraints.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest backer with $13.75 billion invested and rights to some of the ChatGPT maker’s IP, has put up meaningful roadblocks to OpenAI’s future as a for-profit company, with talks dragging on for months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft wants a bigger stake in the restructured company and seeks to secure its access to OpenAI’s tech beyond the current deal, which ends in 2030 or whenever OpenAI says it has achieved AGI — though no one can really agree on what that means.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft has built its Azure OpenAI Service around the smaller company’s models, and has integrated the startup’s tech into Copilot across Windows, Office, and GitHub. If OpenAI suddenly declares it has achieved AGI and cuts off access, Microsoft would lose a huge strategic advantage. The ChatGPT maker has reportedly also told its investors that it expects to pay Microsoft a lower share of its revenue as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A source told Bloomberg that OpenAI also hopes to guarantee that Microsoft deploys OpenAI’s technology safely, especially as it nears AGI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft also stands to gain from OpenAI becoming a for-profit company. The current setup caps investor returns, so a more standard structure would give Microsoft a chance to receive formal equity and significant returns, in addition to access to OpenAI’s tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bloomberg reports that the two companies have been negotiating an equity stake for Microsoft in the low- to mid-30% range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft also stands to gain from OpenAI becoming a for-profit company. The current setup caps investor returns, so a more standard structure would give Microsoft a chance to receive formal equity and significant returns, in addition to access to OpenAI’s tech.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Bloomberg reports that the two companies have been negotiating an equity stake for Microsoft in the low- to mid-30% range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the new features, Canvas, helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel. For example, if you want to create a study plan for an upcoming test, you can click the new “Create Canvas” button to get started.&amp;nbsp;From there, AI Mode will start putting things together in the Canvas side panel, and you can keep refining the output with follow-up prompts until it fits what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Soon, you will also be able to upload files like class notes or a syllabus to customize your study guide. Users enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment in the U.S. will see Canvas in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031925" height="680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Canvas-in-AI-Mode.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also bringing Project Astra capabilities directly into AI Mode via Search Live, which is integrated with Google Lens, the tech giant’s visual search tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you go Live with Search, it’s like having an expert on speed dial who can see what you see and talk through tricky concepts in real-time, all with easy access to helpful links on the web,” wrote Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To use the feature, open Lens in the Google app, tap the Live icon, and ask a question while pointing the camera at something. With this feature, users can have a back-and-forth conversation with Search in AI Mode using visual context from their camera feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031927" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Search-Live-with-video-3-of-3.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Search Live with video input is rolling out this week on mobile in the U.S. for users enrolled in the AI Mode Labs experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Google announced that users will soon be able to use Lens in AI Mode to ask about what’s on their desktop screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Perhaps you’re looking at a geometry problem and want to better understand one of the diagrams,” Stein said. “Click on ‘Ask Google about this page’ from the address bar and select the diagram. You’ll get an AI Overview with a snapshot of key information directly in the side panel. And this week, you’ll be able to follow up with more questions through AI Mode, by selecting AI Mode at the top of the Lens search results or by clicking the ‘Dive deeper’ button at the bottom of the AI Overview.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031929" height="384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-11.42.03AM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, while you can already use AI Mode in the Google app to ask questions about images, you can now do so on desktop as well. Google is also adding support for PDF uploads on desktop, letting you ask detailed questions about documents.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For example, you can upload PDF slides from a school lecture and ask follow-up questions to deepen your understanding beyond the class materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says AI Mode will support additional file types beyond PDFs and images later this year, including Google Drive files.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced on Tuesday that it’s adding new capabilities to&amp;nbsp;AI Mode, its experimental feature that allows users to ask complex questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search. &lt;/p&gt;

This tool aims to offer a faster way to turn your text ideas into everything from short films to product demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;70 million videos have been created since May, showing a huge global appetite for these AI video creation tools. Businesses are diving in as well, generating over 6 million videos since they got early access in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-real-world-applications-for-veo-3"&gt;The real-world applications for Veo 3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this look like in the real world? From global design platforms to major advertising agencies, companies are already putting Veo 3 to work. Take design platform Canva, they are building Veo directly into their software to make video creation simple for their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron Adams, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Canva, said: “Enabling anyone to bring their ideas to life – especially their most creative ones – has been core to Canva’s mission ever since we set out to empower the world to design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By democratising access to a powerful technology like Google’s Veo 3 inside Canva AI, your big ideas can now be brought to life in the highest quality video and sound, all from within your existing Canva subscription. In true Canva fashion, we’ve built this with an intuitive interface and simple editing tools in place, all backed by Canva Shield.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For creative agencies like BarkleyOKRP, the big wins are speed and quality. They claim to have been so impressed with the latest version that they went back and remade videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Ray Barr, Senior Vice President Client Experience at BarkleyOKRP, commented: “The rapid advancements from Veo 2 to Veo 3 within such a short time frame on this project have been nothing short of remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team undertook the task of re-creating numerous music videos initially produced with Veo 2 once Veo 3 was released, primarily due to the significantly improved synchronization between voice and mouth movements. The continuous daily progress we are witnessing is truly extraordinary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s even changing how global companies connect with local customers.

Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify’s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Asked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can think of it as us getting a new dataset,” he said. “Spotify’s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song — like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon ‘people who bought this also bought that,’” he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And that’s completely new to us, and it’s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You’re just going to see that expand,” Söderström said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Plus, AI technology would allow Spotify to do more than just predict what someone might want to listen to, whether music, podcasts, or audiobooks, as it does today. Instead of only making predictions, it would be able to “reason” over the user’s listening history and what they said to the AI DJ. The reference to reasoning suggests that Spotify is looking toward AI reasoning models that can perform more complex tasks across multiple steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The voice data in question comes from Spotify’s AI DJ feature. In May 2025, Spotify introduced a way for Premium subscribers to make voice requests to the English-language AI DJ by pressing a button in the app. This lets users change the music, the genre, or the mood of a playlist using a voice command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Consumer features aren’t the only way Spotify is leveraging AI. During the call, the exec also mentioned that Spotify is using generative AI internally to more rapidly prototype products and create efficiencies in other areas of its business, like finance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the quarter, Spotify hit 276 million paying subscribers, up 12% year-over-year, and 696 million monthly active users, but swung to a loss after missing revenue targets. The stock fell 10% on weak guidance and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s comments about his unhappiness with the company’s ads business.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spotify-app-GettyImages-1689920063-e1702479483636.jpeg?resize=1200,676" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Spotify has experimented with various voice interfaces in the past, and more recently, added an AI DJ that introduces tunes the company thinks you’ll like and lets you make your own requests. Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify’s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Asked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can think of it as us getting a new dataset,” he said. “Spotify’s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song — like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon ‘people who bought this also bought that,’” he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And that’s completely new to us, and it’s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As a result, the exec says we can expect Spotify’s consumer experiences to get “much more interactive.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You’re just going to see that expand,” Söderström said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI announced Study Mode for ChatGPT on Tuesday, a new feature that fundamentally changes how students interact with artificial intelligence by withholding direct answers in favor of Socratic questioning and step-by-step guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch represents OpenAI’s most significant push into the education technology market, which analysts project will reach $80.5 billion by 2030. Rather than simply providing solutions to homework problems, Study Mode acts more like a patient tutor, asking follow-up questions and calibrating responses to individual skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set out to understand how students are using ChatGPT and how we might make it an even better tool for education,” said Leah Belsky, OpenAI’s VP of Education, during a press conference ahead of the launch. “Early research shows that how ChatGPT is used in learning makes a difference in the learning outcomes that it drives. When ChatGPT is prompted to teach or tutor, it can significantly improve academic performance. But when it’s just used as an answer machine, it can hinder learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature addresses a fundamental tension that has emerged since ChatGPT’s explosive adoption among students. While one in three college-aged Americans now use the AI tool, with learning as the top use case, educators have grappled with whether such tools enhance understanding or encourage academic shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study Mode employs what OpenAI calls “custom system instructions” developed in collaboration with pedagogy experts from over 40 institutions worldwide. When students ask questions, the AI responds with guided prompts rather than direct answers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a demonstration, Abhi Muchhal, an OpenAI product manager, showed how asking ChatGPT to “teach me about game theory” in regular mode produces a comprehensive, textbook-like response. In Study Mode, however, the AI instead asks: “What’s your current level? What are you optimizing for?” before providing tailored, bite-sized explanations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want this to be learner-led,” Muchhal explained. “At each step, there’s a question that is asking students to try to build on top. What we’re doing here is scaffolding learning and teaching one topic, asking a question, and building on top of that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system even resists students’ attempts to obtain quick answers. When prompted with “just give me the answer,” Study Mode responds that “the point of this is to learn, not just to give you the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-college-students-report-dramatic-learning-confidence-boost-with-ai-tutoring"&gt;College Students Report Dramatic Learning Confidence Boost with AI Tutoring&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three college students who tested Study Mode early provided compelling testimonials about its impact on their learning confidence and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maggie Wang, a Princeton computer science senior, described how the tool helped her finally understand sinusoidal positional encodings, a concept she had struggled with despite taking NLP courses and attending office hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I truly think that there’s nothing I can’t learn,” Wang said. “It’s given me a confidence that has absolutely changed my experience as a student. ChatGPT has really enabled me to think critically about being a researcher, reading papers, brainstorming research directions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Praja Tickoo, a Wharton student studying economics, noted the stark difference between regular ChatGPT and Study Mode when reviewing accounting materials: “It felt like it really understood where to start… it made sure that I was ready to move on at each step. The biggest difference between regular ChatGPT and ChatGPT with study mode is kind of feels like a tool to me. ChatGPT with study mode felt like a learning partner.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-education-battle-heats-up-as-google-anthropic-race-to-capture-80-billion-market"&gt;AI Education Battle Heats Up as Google, Anthropic Race to Capture $80 Billion Market&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Study Mode launch comes as major AI companies race to capture the lucrative education market. Anthropic recently announced Claude for Education with its own “Learning Mode” that similarly emphasizes Socratic questioning over direct answers. Google has tested “Guided Learning for Gemini,” while making its $20 Gemini AI Pro subscription free for students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This competitive landscape reflects the sector’s recognition that educational applications represent both a massive market opportunity and a chance to demonstrate AI’s beneficial societal impact. Unlike consumer applications focused on convenience, educational AI tools must balance accessibility with pedagogical principles that promote genuine learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The research landscape is still taking shape on the best ways to apply AI in education,” OpenAI noted in its announcement, signaling that Study Mode represents an early experiment rather than a definitive solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-behind-the-scenes-how-openai-built-study-mode-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Behind the Scenes: How OpenAI Built Study Mode and What Comes Next&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI built Study Mode using custom system instructions rather than training the behavior directly into its underlying models. This approach allows for rapid iteration based on student feedback, though it may result in some inconsistent behavior across conversations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company plans to eventually integrate these behaviors directly into its main models once it has gathered sufficient data on what works best. Future enhancements under consideration include clearer visualizations for complex concepts, goal setting and progress tracking across conversations, and deeper personalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study Mode launched Tuesday for ChatGPT’s Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for ChatGPT Edu coming in the following weeks. The company has not yet implemented admin-level controls that would allow educational institutions to mandate Study Mode usage, though Belsky indicated this is “definitely something that we’re seeing our early customers ask for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gpt-5-launch-and-ai-agent-breakthroughs-signal-new-era-for-educational-technology"&gt;GPT-5 Launch and AI Agent Breakthroughs Signal New Era for Educational Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The educational AI push comes amid rapid advancement in AI capabilities that both excite and concern educators. Last week, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Agent demonstrated it could pass through “I am not a robot” verification tests, highlighting how AI systems increasingly navigate digital environments designed to exclude them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, reports suggest OpenAI is preparing to launch GPT-5 in early August, which would unify the company’s reasoning and multi-modal capabilities into a single, more powerful model. Such advances raise the stakes for educational applications, as more capable AI could either enhance learning outcomes or make academic integrity challenges more acute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing also coincides with ongoing contract negotiations between Microsoft and OpenAI regarding access to future AI technologies, underscoring the commercial importance of maintaining competitive advantages in key markets like education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-study-mode-means-for-the-future-of-ai-powered-learning"&gt;What Study Mode Means for the Future of AI-Powered Learning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI emphasized that Study Mode represents “a first step in a longer journey to improve learning in ChatGPT.” The company is collaborating with Stanford University’s SCALE Initiative to conduct longer-term studies on how students learn best with AI, with plans to publish findings on the links between model design and cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For educational institutions weighing AI adoption, Study Mode offers a middle path between outright bans and unrestricted access. By building pedagogical principles directly into the AI interface, OpenAI has created a tool that could satisfy both educators’ concerns about learning integrity and students’ desire for AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Caleb Masi, a University of Minnesota student in the testing program, noted: “We’re really just scratching the surface of what AI tools can do to support students. The more we lean into these tools thoughtfully as a community, the more empowered we can become, not just as students, but as lifelong learners.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ultimate test won’t be whether AI can provide the right answers, but whether it can teach students to ask better questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says Study Mode is rolling out to logged in users on ChatGPT’s Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans starting Tuesday. The company expects to introduce Study Mode to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator’s have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Study Mode is OpenAI’s attempt to address the millions of students who use ChatGPT in school. Studies have shown that using ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor for young people, but it also may harm their critical thinking skills. A research paper released in June found that people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people’s lives from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, called Learning Mode, in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI’s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

First introduced at Google I/O in May, Video Overviews allow users to&amp;nbsp;turn dense multimedia, such as raw notes, PDFs, and images, into digestible visual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Previously, the service took an audio approach to helping users understand materials with Audio Overviews, a feature that gives users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this new capability, NotebookLM is taking a more visual approach to helping users understand different topics and ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says users can think of Video Overviews as a visual alternative to Audio Overviews. The feature creates new visuals while pulling in images, diagrams, quotes, and numbers from uploaded documents to explain the content. Google says the feature is good for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts easier to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3032032" height="381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.01.05PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users can customize their Video Overviews, just as they do with Audio Overviews. They can specify topics to focus on, indicate their learning goals, describe the target audience, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They can ask simple questions like, “I know nothing about this topic; help me understand the diagrams in the paper,” or specific ones like, “I’m already an expert on X and my team works on Y; focus on Z.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Video Overviews are now rolling out to all users in English, with support for more languages coming soon, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced that it’s rolling out updates to NotebookLM’s Studio panel. Users can now&amp;nbsp;create and store multiple studio outputs of the same type in a single notebook. Plus, users will now see four tiles at the top of the Studio panel for creating Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, Mind Maps, and Reports with a single click. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, users can now multitask within the Studio panel. For example, they can listen to an Audio Overview while simultaneously exploring a Mind Map or reviewing a Study Guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google announced on Tuesday that it’s rolling out Video Overviews to NotebookLM, its AI-based note-taking and research assistant.

It’s part of a wider push by the company to get AI more embedded into classrooms when the new academic year starts in September.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A demonstration for reporters from OpenAI showed what happens when a student asks Study Mode about an academic subject like game theory. The chatbot begins by asking what the student wants to know and then attempts to build an exchange, where the pair work methodically toward the answer together. OpenAI says the tool was built after consulting with pedagogy experts from over 40 institutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A handful of college students who were part of OpenAI’s testing cohort—hailing from Princeton, Wharton, and the University of Minnesota—shared positive reviews of Study Mode, saying it did a good job of checking their understanding and adapting to their pace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The learning approaches that OpenAI has programmed into Study Mode, which are based partially on Socratic methods, appear sound, says Christopher Harris, an educator in New York who has created a curriculum aimed at AI literacy. They might grant educators more confidence about allowing, or even encouraging, their students to use AI. “Professors will see this as working with them in support of learning as opposed to just being a way for students to cheat on assignments,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But there’s a more ambitious vision behind Study Mode. As demonstrated in OpenAI’s recent partnership with leading teachers’ unions, the company is currently trying to rebrand chatbots as tools for personalized learning rather than cheating. Part of this promise is that AI will act like the expensive human tutors that currently only the most well-off students’ families can typically afford.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can begin to close the gap between those with access to learning resources and high-quality education and those who have been historically left behind,” says OpenAI’s head of education. Leah Belsky.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;But painting Study Mode as an education equalizer obfuscates one glaring problem. Underneath the hood, it is not a tool trained exclusively on academic textbooks and other approved materials—it’s more like the same old ChatGPT, tuned with a new conversation filter that simply governs how it responds to students, encouraging fewer answers and more explanations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This AI tutor, therefore, more resembles what you’d get if you hired a human tutor who has read every required textbook, but also every flawed explanation of the subject ever posted to Reddit, Tumblr, and the farthest reaches of the web. And because of the way AI works, you can’t expect it to distinguish right information from wrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Professors encouraging their students to use it run the risk of it teaching them to approach problems in the wrong way—or worse, being taught material that is fabricated or entirely false.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this limitation, I asked OpenAI if Study Mode is limited to particular subjects. The company said no—students will be able to use it to discuss anything they’d normally talk to ChatGPT about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that access to human tutors—which for certain subjects can cost upward of $200 an hour—is typically for the elite few. The notion that AI models can spread the benefits of tutoring to the masses holds an allure. Indeed, it is backed up by at least some early research that shows AI models can adapt to individual learning styles and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But this improvement comes with a hidden cost. Tools like Study Mode, at least for now, take a shortcut by using large language models’ humanlike conversational style without fixing their inherent flaws.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI also acknowledges that this tool won’t prevent a student who’s frustrated and wants an answer from simply going back to normal ChatGPT. “If someone wants to subvert learning, and sort of get answers and take the easier route, that is possible,” Belsky says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, one thing going for Study Mode, the students say, is that it’s simply more fun to study with a chatbot that’s always encouraging you along than to stare at a textbook on Bayesian theorem for the hundredth time. “It’s like the reward signal of like, oh, wait, I can learn this small thing,” says Maggie Wang, a student from Princeton who tested it. The tool is free for now, but Praja Tickoo, a student from Wharton, says it wouldn’t have to be for him to use it. “I think it’s absolutely something I would be willing to pay for,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/StudyMode_Flow_7-29.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is launching Study Mode, a version of ChatGPT for college students that it promises will act less like a lookup tool and more like a friendly, always-available tutor.

We are in awe that we have this precious baby!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lindsey and her husband, Tim Pierce, who live in London, Ohio, “adopted” the embryo from a woman who had it created in 1994.&amp;nbsp;She says her family and church family think “it’s like something from a sci-fi movie.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The baby has a 30-year-old sister,” she adds. Tim was a toddler when the embryos were first created.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s been pretty surreal,” says Linda Archerd, 62, who donated the embryo. “It’s hard to even believe.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Three little hopes&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The story starts back in the early 1990s. Archerd had been trying—and failing—to get pregnant for six years. She and her husband decided to try IVF, a fairly new technology at the time. “People were [unfamiliar] with it,” says Archerd. “A lot of people were like, what are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;They did it anyway, and in May 1994, they managed to create four embryos. One of them was transferred to Linda’s uterus. It resulted in a healthy baby girl. “I was so blessed to have a baby,” Archerd says. The remaining three embryos were cryopreserved and kept in a storage tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was 31 years ago. The healthy baby girl is now a 30-year-old woman who has her own 10-year-old daughter. But the other three embryos remained frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Archerd originally planned to use the embryos herself. “I always wanted another baby desperately,” she says. “I called them my three little hopes.” Her then husband felt differently, she says. Archerd went on to divorce him, but she won custody of the embryos and kept them in storage, still hopeful she might use them one day, perhaps with another partner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That meant paying annual storage fees, which increased over time and ended up costing Archerd around a thousand dollars a year, she says. To her, it was worth it. “I always thought it was the right thing to do,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things changed when she started going through menopause, she says. She considered her options. She didn’t want to discard the embryos or donate them for research. And she didn’t want to donate them to another family anonymously—she wanted to meet the parents and any resulting babies. “It’s my DNA; it came from me … and [it’s] my daughter’s sibling,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then she found out about embryo “adoption.” This is a type of embryo donation in which both donors and recipients have a say in whom they “place” their embryos with or “adopt” them from. It is overseen by agencies—usually explicitly religious ones—that believe an embryo is morally equivalent to a born human. Archerd is Christian.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are several agencies that offer these adoption services in the US, but not all of them accept embryos that have been stored for a very long time. That’s partly because those embryos will have been frozen and stored in unfamiliar, old-fashioned ways, and partly because old embryos are thought to be less likely to survive thawing and transfer to successfully develop into a baby.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“So many places wouldn’t even take my information,” says Archerd. Then she came across the Snowflakes program run by the Nightlight Christian Adoptions agency. The agency was willing to accept her embryos, but it needed Archerd’s medical records from the time the embryos had been created, as well as the embryos’ lab records.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;So Archerd called the fertility doctor who had treated her decades before. “I still remembered his phone number by heart,” she says. That doctor, now in his 70s, is still practicing at a clinic in Oregon. He dug Archerd’s records out from his basement, she says. “Some of [them] were handwritten,” she adds. Her embryos entered Nightlight’s “matching pool” in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Making a match&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Our matching process is really driven by the preferences of the placing family,” says Beth Button, executive director of the Snowflakes program. Archerd’s preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US. “I didn’t want them to go out of the country,” says Archerd. “And being Christian is very important to me, because I am.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It took a while to find a match. Most of the “adopting parents” signed up for the Snowflakes program were already registered at fertility clinics that wouldn’t have accepted the embryos, says Button. “I would say that over 90% of clinics in the US would not have accepted these embryos,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Expecting parents Tim and Lindsey Pierce." class="wp-image-1120633" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724_recordbaby_parents2.jpg?w=1727" width="1727" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lindsey and Tim Pierce at Rejoice Fertility.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY LINDSEY PIERCE&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Archerd’s embryos were assigned to the agency’s Open Hearts program for embryos that are “hard to place,” along with others that have been in storage for a long time or are otherwise thought to be less likely to result in a healthy birth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lindsey and Tim Pierce had also signed up for the Open Hearts program. The couple, aged 35 and 34, respectively, had been trying for a baby for seven years and had seen multiple doctors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lindsey was researching child adoption when she came across the Snowflakes program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the couple were considering their criteria for embryos they might receive, they decided that they’d be open to any. “We checkmarked anything and everything,” says Tim. That’s how they ended up being matched with Archerd’s embryos. “We thought it was wild,” says Lindsey. “We didn’t know they froze embryos that long ago.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lindsey and Tim had registered with Rejoice Fertility, an IVF clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee, run by John Gordon, a reproductive endocrinologist who prides himself on his efforts to reduce the number of embryos in storage. The huge numbers of embryos left in storage tanks was weighing on his conscience, he says, so around six years ago, he set up Rejoice Fertility with the aim of doing things differently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Now we’re here in the belt buckle of the Bible Belt,” says Gordon, who is Reformed Presbyterian. “I’ve changed my mode of practice.” IVF treatments performed at the clinic are designed to create as few excess embryos as possible. The clinic works with multiple embryo adoption agencies and will accept any embryo, no matter how long it has been in storage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A portrait of Linda Archerd." class="wp-image-1120605" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250724_recordbaby_donor.jpg?w=1500" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY LINDA ARCHERD&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was his clinic that treated the parents who previously held the record for the longest-stored embryo—in 2022, Rachel and Philip Ridgeway had twins from embryos created more than 30 years earlier. “They’re such a lovely couple,” says Gordon. When we spoke, he was making plans to meet the family for breakfast. The twins are “growing like weeds,” he says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We have certain guiding principles, and they’re coming from our faith,” says Gordon, although he adds that he sees patients who hold alternative views. One of those principles is that “every embryo deserves a chance at life and that the only embryo that cannot result in a healthy baby is the embryo not given the opportunity to be transferred into a patient.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s why his team will endeavor to transfer any embryo they receive, no matter the age or conditions. That can be challenging, especially when the embryos have been frozen or stored in unusual or outdated ways. “It’s scary for people who don’t know how to do it,” says Sarah Atkinson, lab supervisor and head embryologist at Rejoice Fertility. “You don’t want to kill someone’s embryos if you don’t know what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cumbersome and explosive&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the early days of IVF, embryos earmarked for storage were slow-frozen. This technique involves gradually lowering the temperature of the embryos. But because slow freezing can cause harmful ice crystals to form, clinics switched in the 2000s to a technique called vitrification, in which the embryos are placed in thin plastic tubes called straws and lowered into tanks of liquid nitrogen. This rapidly freezes the embryos and converts them into a glass-like state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The embryos can later be thawed by removing them from the tanks and rapidly—within two seconds—plunging them into warm “thaw media,” says Atkinson. Thawing slow-frozen embryos is more complicated. And the exact thawing method required varies, depending on how the embryos were preserved and what they were stored in. Some of the devices need to be opened while they are inside the storage tank, which can involve using forceps, diamond-bladed knives, and other tools in the liquid nitrogen, says Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-video"&gt;&lt;video controls="controls" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/McElyea-ICSI-1.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sarah Atkinson, lab supervisor and head embryologist at Rejoice Fertility, directly injects sperm into two eggs to fertilize them.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="video-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF SARAH ATKINSON AT REJOICE FERTILITY.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recently, she was tasked with retrieving embryos that had been stored inside a glass vial. The vial was made from blown glass and had been heat-sealed with the embryo inside. Atkinson had to use her diamond-bladed knife to snap open the seal inside the nitrogen tank. It was fiddly work, and when the device snapped, a small shard of glass flew out and hit Atkinson’s face. “Hit me on the cheek, cut my cheek, blood running down my face, and I’m like, &lt;em&gt;Oh shit,&lt;/em&gt;” she says. Luckily, she had her safety goggles on. And the embryos survived, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1120770" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pierce-Lindsey.jpg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The two embryos that were transferred to Lindsey Pierce.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Atkinson has a folder in her office with notes she’s collected on various devices over the years. She flicks through it over a video call and points to the notes she made about the glass vial. “Might explode; wear face shield and eye protection,” she reads. A few pages later, she points to another embryo-storage device. “You have to thaw this one in your fingers,” she tells me. “I don’t like it.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The record-breaking embryos had been slow-frozen and stored in a plastic vial, says Atkinson. Thawing them was a cumbersome process. But all three embryos survived it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Pierces had to travel from their home in Ohio to the clinic in Tennessee five times over a two-week period. “It was like a five-hour drive,” says Lindsey. One of the three embryos stopped growing. The other two were transferred to Lindsey’s uterus on November 14, she says. And one developed into a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now that the baby has arrived, Archerd is keen to meet him. “The first thing that I noticed when Lindsey sent me his pictures is how much he looks like my daughter when she was a baby,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“I pulled out my baby book and compared them side by side, and there is no doubt that they are siblings.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She doesn’t yet have plans to meet the baby, but doing so would be “a dream come true,” she says. “I wish that they didn’t live so far away from me ... He is perfect!”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t go into it thinking we would break any records,” says Lindsey. “We just wanted to have a baby.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1120800" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1000004661.jpg?w=480" /&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A baby boy born over the weekend holds the new record for the “oldest baby.” Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26, developed from an embryo that had been in storage for 30 and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We had a rough birth but we are both doing well now,” says Lindsey Pierce, his mother.&amp;nbsp;"He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lindsey and her husband, Tim Pierce, who live in London, Ohio, “adopted” the embryo from a woman who had it created in 1994.&amp;nbsp;She says her family and church family think “it’s like something from a sci-fi movie.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The baby has a 30-year-old sister,” she adds. Tim was a toddler when the embryos were first created.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“It’s been pretty surreal,” says Linda Archerd, 62, who donated the embryo. “It’s hard to even believe.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Three little hopes&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The story starts back in the early 1990s. Archerd had been trying—and failing—to get pregnant for six years. She and her husband decided to try IVF, a fairly new technology at the time. “People were [unfamiliar] with it,” says Archerd. “A lot of people were like, what are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;They did it anyway, and in May 1994, they managed to create four embryos. One of them was transferred to Linda’s uterus. It resulted in a healthy baby girl. “I was so blessed to have a baby,” Archerd says. The remaining three embryos were cryopreserved and kept in a storage tank.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was 31 years ago. The healthy baby girl is now a 30-year-old woman who has her own 10-year-old daughter. But the other three embryos remained frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Archerd originally planned to use the embryos herself. “I always wanted another baby desperately,” she says. “I called them my three little hopes.” Her then husband felt differently, she says.

          &lt;p&gt;The rise of large language models like ChatGPT has led to widespread concern that "everyone is cheating their way through college," as a recent New York magazine article memorably put it. Now, OpenAI is rolling out a new "Study Mode" that it claims is less about providing answers or doing the work for students and more about helping them "build [a] deep understanding" of complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study Mode isn't a new ChatGPT model but a series of "custom system instructions" written for the LLM "in collaboration with teachers, scientists, and pedagogy experts to reflect a core set of behaviors that support deeper learning," OpenAI said. Instead of the usual summary of a subject that stock ChatGPT might give—which one OpenAI employee likened to "a mini textbook chapter"—Study Mode slowly rolls out new information in a "scaffolded" structure. The mode is designed to ask "guiding questions" in the Socratic style and to pause for periodic "knowledge checks" and personalized feedback to make sure the user understands before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unknown how many students will use this guided learning tool instead of just asking ChatGPT to generate answers from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an early hands-off demo attended by Ars Technica, Study Mode responded to a request to "teach me about game theory" by first asking about the user's overall familiarity with the subject and what they'll be using the information for. ChatGPT introduced a short overview of some core game theory concepts, then paused to ask a question before providing a relevant real-world example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example involving a classic "train traveling at speed" math problem, Study Mode resisted multiple simulated attempts by the frustrated "student" to simply ask for the answer and instead tried to gently redirect the conversation to how the available information could be used to generate that answer. An OpenAI representative told Ars that Study Mode will eventually provide direct solutions if asked repeatedly, but the default behavior is more tuned to a Socratic tutoring style.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A 24/7 tutorbot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In building Study Mode, OpenAI said it was inspired by "power users" who were already trying to adapt ChatGPT into a personal tutor or test prep tool via specific sets of prompts. Through Study Mode, OpenAI says it hopes to give less technically minded users the ability to access "a personal tutor that never gets tired of their questions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI says it worked with pedagogy experts who evaluated the mode's behaviors and gave the model "golden examples" of how ideal tutors would respond in certain situations. It also consulted with groups of college students who were given advance access to the new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press conference attended by Ars, some of those students waxed rhapsodical about Study Mode's ability to push them toward the next important bit of knowledge and the confidence they gained in their ability to learn when using the tool. One student talked about the vulnerability and embarrassment of having to go to a TA's office hours for help and the flexibility of having multi-hour tutoring sessions available via ChatGPT at any time of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can you trust it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are familiar with LLMs' long-standing tendency to confabulate completely false information might be reluctant to use these kinds of models as a study aid. In a press release, OpenAI allowed that the current Study Mode prompt "results in some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a company spokesperson told Ars that the risk of hallucination was lower with Study Mode because the model goes through information in smaller chunks, calibrating along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Study Mode wasn't designed explicitly to address concerns about ChatGPT being used to cheat on assignments, a spokesperson told Ars that it could help allay educators' fears that students are simply using LLMs to get out of doing their own work. Study Mode will be added to its ChatGPT Edu product "in a few weeks" for subscribing schools that want to offer a different kind of AI experience to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, though, OpenAI says the specialized Study Mode system prompts are a "first step" to training similar behaviors "directly into our main models" in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
