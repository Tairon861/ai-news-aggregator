Formerly known as SGE, AI overviews are the succinct AI-generated summaries of information that appear right at the top of Google for a majority of search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can serve as a convenient way to get a question answered quickly without having to sift through so many options of links to click on, it certainly has some issues. There have been plenty of instances of false information being presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and trust are particularly important in high-stakes industries like health, law, and finance. What happens when someone asks Google a medical or legal question and receives a wrong answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIO also poses new challenges for SEO professionals, as it reshapes how users search online and how businesses need to shift their SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iLawyer Marketing, a law firm SEO, offers perspective on how businesses in high-stakes industries can stay visible and trusted in an AI-driven search landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-technology-behind-ai-overviews-and-their-limitations"&gt;The technology behind AI overviews and their limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-generated summaries at the top of Google aren’t going anywhere. A recent study from Pew Research found that 58% of participants saw an AI-generated summary when conducting searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summaries are created using large language models (LLMs) that aggregate content, extract relevant answers, and provide source citations. However, AI Overviews contain the same misinformation that organic results can, and they can hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of controversy has arisen over AI hallucinations, or false statements that AI produces out of confusion. AI isn’t perfect, after all. There are also concerns over source transparency, as users can’t always tell where the answer is coming from at a glance. For high-stakes topics, that’s a problem. If the source is wrong or unreliable, the answer might be too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-and-opportunities-in-high-stakes-industries"&gt;Risks and opportunities in high-stakes industries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some AI hallucinations are harmless and rather amusing (the “adding glue to pizza” response, for example), in high-stakes industries, this misinformation can have more serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who are seeking medical or legal advice on Google, which is not recommended but inevitable, can end up with incorrect AI overviews shoved in their faces. And since such answers are prominently featured at the top of the page, they carry unearned authority. One bad answer could lead to poor medical decisions, legal missteps, or financial harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that AI overviews present an opportunity for authoritative, trustworthy sites to be cited more often. For professionals in law, healthcare, and finance, this means it’s important to have content that is accurate, well-structured, and published by credentialed experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news for SEO experts is that organic rankings are no longer the sole focus. The new race is to be featured in the AIO. If a user asking for legal advice can get their answer, whether true or not, without clicking any links, why would they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, if you’re ranking well organically, you have a higher chance of being featured in the AIO. Ahrefs recently found that 76% of AIO citations pull from the top ten results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-law-firm-seo"&gt;Implications for law firm SEO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can law firms and other high-stakes professionals adapt? They need to ensure that content is addressing common questions and doing so in a clear, structured format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of E-E-A-T is alive and well in SEO: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. This content strategy hasn’t gone anywhere and is likely a factor in AIO citations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In legal content, questions like “Do I need a lawyer after a car accident?” can be used as headings, with a clear answer following. Any legal answer that can be cited with a government statute should absolutely do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of gaining authority and trust comes from getting high-quality backlinks. Being cited in trusted sources like legal directories, news sites, or .edu and .gov pages is still an important part of SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEO professionals suggest focusing on both traditional ranking factors and new AIO-specific formats to cover all the bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-seo-pros-should-be-doing-now"&gt;What SEO pros should be doing now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in optimising for AI is to monitor how your site appears in overviews. You can search manually or use tools, but start tracking which queries you appear for and which page or section of your page is cited. You should also look at which page or section of your competitors’ pages are being cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schema, or structured data, is one strategy for trying to get your content into the AIO. It communicates your content to Google in a language it understands more easily and is your best shot at getting rich results. Having FAQ sections on your pages with concise answers and structured data will improve AI accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea to reevaluate which of your current pages are targeting high-intent, high-risk queries. Can you strengthen the answers? Improve readability? Cite more trustworthy sources? Even small edits might make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s AI overviews are raising the bar for content in industries where precision matters. For law firm SEO and other high-stakes verticals, success now means becoming a trustworthy source, not just a top result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms that invest in high-quality content, structure, and authority will be better positioned for an AI-driven search experience, no matter what that looks like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Header-Google-e1753778670635.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve searched anything on Google lately, chances are you’ve seen an AI overview (AIO).

But the company hopes its twist on the technology could help bring cheap, long-duration energy storage to new places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In traditional pumped hydro storage facilities, electric pumps move water uphill, into a natural or manmade body of water. Then, when electricity is needed, that water is released and flows downhill past a turbine, generating electricity. Quidnet’s approach instead pumps water down into impermeable rock formations and keeps it under pressure so it flows up when released. “It’s like pumped hydro, upside down,” says CEO Joe Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Quidnet started a six-month test of its technology in late 2024, pressurizing the system. In June, the company was able to discharge 35 megawatt-hours of energy from the well. There was virtually no self-discharge, meaning no energy loss, Zhou says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Inexpensive forms of energy storage that can store electricity for weeks or months could help inconsistent electricity sources like wind and solar go further for the grid. And Quidnet’s approach, which uses commercially available equipment, could be deployed quickly and qualify for federal tax credits to help make it even cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, there’s still a big milestone ahead: turning the pressurized water back into electricity. The company is currently building a facility with the turbines and support equipment to do that—all the components are available to purchase from established companies. “We don’t need to invent new things based on what we’ve already developed today,” Zhou says. “We can now start just deploying at very, very substantial scales.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That process will come with energy losses. Energy storage systems are typically measured by their round-trip efficiency: how much of the electricity that’s put into the system is returned at the end as electricity. Modeling suggests that Quidnet’s technology could reach a maximum efficiency of about 65%, Zhou says, though some design choices made to optimize for economics will likely cause the system to land at roughly 50%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s less efficient than lithium-ion batteries, but long-duration systems, if they’re cheap enough, can operate at low efficiencies and still be useful for the grid, says Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It’s got to be cost-competitive; it all comes down to that,” Denholm says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries, the fastest-growing technology in energy storage, are the target that new forms of energy storage, like Quidnet’s, must chase. Lithium-ion batteries are about 90% cheaper today than they were 15 years ago. They’ve become a price-competitive alternative to building new natural-gas plants, Denholm says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to competing with batteries, one potential differentiator for Quidnet could be government subsidies. While the Trump administration has clawed back funding for clean energy technologies, there’s still an energy storage tax credit, though recently passed legislation added new supply chain restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Starting in 2026, new energy storage facilities hoping to qualify for tax credits will need to prove that at least 55% of the value of a project’s materials are not from foreign entities of concern. That rules out sourcing batteries from China, which dominates battery production today. Quidnet has a “high level of domestic content” and expects to qualify for tax credits under the new rules, Zhou says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The facility Quidnet is building is a project with utility partner CPS Energy, and it should come online in early 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250728-BatteryStartup_New.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Texas-based startup Quidnet Energy just completed a test showing it can store energy for up to six months by pumping water underground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using water to store electricity is hardly a new concept—pumped hydropower storage has been around for over a century.

But the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won’t come as a surprise, and you’ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When Americans get scammed, they’re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI’s development.

The law had bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Now, the White House says it’s concerned about the issues deepfakes could pose for the legal system. For example, it says, “fake evidence could be used to attempt to deny justice to both plaintiffs and defendants.” It calls for new standards for deepfake detection and asks the Department of Justice to create rules around it.

They believe that AI, if harnessed correctly, can help them win everything from culture wars to geopolitical conflicts. The right AI, they argue, will help defeat China. Government pressure on leading companies can force them to purge “woke” ideology from their models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plan includes crowd-pleasers—like cracking down on deepfakes—but overall, it reflects how tech giants have cozied up to the Trump administration.

But the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Many of the points in the plan won’t come as a surprise, and you’ve probably heard of the big ones by now. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump is escalating his fight with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When Americans get scammed, they’re supposed to be helped by the Federal Trade Commission. As I wrote last week, the FTC under President Biden increasingly targeted AI companies that overhyped the accuracy of their systems, as well as deployments of AI it found to have harmed consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Trump plan vows to take a fresh look at all the FTC actions under the previous administration as part of an effort to get rid of “onerous” regulation that it claims is hampering AI’s development. The administration may even attempt to repeal some of the FTC’s actions entirely. This would weaken a major AI watchdog agency, but it’s just the latest in the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on the FTC. Read more in my story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, domestic firms are hoping to reduce their dependence on US technology. The stakes extend far beyond technological supremacy, with both nations viewing AI dominance as critical to future economic and strategic power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shanghai’s US$139 million AI investment gambit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai has unveiled an ambitious one billion yuan (US$139 million) subsidy programme for its artificial intelligence industry, marking the latest in the technological race as major cities in China engage in fierce AI competition for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive package allocates resources in three key areas: 600 million yuan for computing power subsidies, 300 million yuan for third-party AI model discounts, and 100 million yuan to support companies in procuring training datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme offers subsidy rates ranging from 10% to 100% of contract values for computing facilities, AI models, and datasets, according to documents released by the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatisation. The city plans to offer up to 500 million yuan to new AI research institutions, with funding guaranteed for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of Shanghai’s key advantages in AI development is its strong funding,” said Pan Helin, a member of an expert committee under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. However, Pan noted that Shanghai’s high operating costs often push AI start-ups toward cheaper alternatives like nearby Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nationwide competition heats up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai’s initiative reflects a broader pattern in China, where cities are competing aggressively to establish AI dominance in what has become an intense inter-city competition. Hangzhou has emerged as a particular rival, having announced plans last year to distribute 250 million yuan in computing power subsidies while nurturing its “six little dragons” – a collection of well-known Chinese start-ups, including AI player DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inter-city rivalry extends beyond Shanghai and Hangzhou, with Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Beijing also introducing similar support measures. This situation demonstrates how artificial intelligence has become a strategic priority at multiple levels of Chinese government – domestic AI competition in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump’s AI strategy maintains pressure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of Shanghai’s announcement coincides with the Trump administration’s comprehensive AI Action Plan, unveiled on July 23. The 28-page strategy maintains tight restrictions on key technologies while accelerating deregulation and infrastructure support for US AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump described the plan as “a policy of the United States to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,” emphasising America’s intention to become an “AI export powerhouse” and maintain national security protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan tasks the US Commerce Department with closing loopholes in current export restrictions, boosting oversight of end users abroad, and a plan to explore geolocation tools to block access to “countries of concern” like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;China’s self-reliance strategy shows results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite US restrictions, analysts predict significant growth for China’s domestic AI industry. Bernstein analysts led by Lin Qingyuan forecast that domestic chips will capture 55% of China’s AI accelerator market by 2027, up dramatically from just 17% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Export controls have created a unique opportunity for domestic AI chip vendors, as they are not competing with the most advanced global alternatives,” the Bernstein research note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth reflects ongoing technological progress, with Chinese companies increasingly matching the performance of downgraded chips sold to China. Huawei’s Ascend 910C now reaches approximately 65% of Nvidia’s supreme H100 capacity, though its computing power remains limited by lack of direct compatibility with Nvidia’s CUDA software platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Geopolitical implications and future outlook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bo Zhengyuan of Plenum, an independent China-focused research platform, argues that Trump’s approach represents a shift from Biden’s containment strategy to more direct competition. “So far, the ‘yard’ hasn’t gotten any smaller,” Bo noted, according to a &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; article, referring to export control scope. “What’s different is the rhetoric – it’s now more head-to-head than containment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI competition between China and the US appears set to intensify further, so much so that at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation to ensure AI does not become an “exclusive game” accessible only to a select few – a clear reference to US restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neither US pressure nor Chinese subsidies guarantees clear winners in this technological race. “AI isn’t something that can be built overnight through policy support alone – it’s a long game shaped by engineering, talent, and infrastructure,” Bo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With China’s data resources, algorithms, and AI talent remaining competitive with the US despite chip restrictions, the outcome of this technological competition may ultimately depend on which approach – American technological restrictions or Chinese self-reliance investments – proves more effective in driving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There won’t be a clear winner or loser in the next decade,” Bo concluded, suggesting that this technological rivalry will define the AI landscape for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Ren Zhengfei: China’s AI future and Huawei’s long game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you may have missed about Trump’s AI Action Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The executive orders and announcements coming from the White House since Donald Trump returned to office have painted an ambitious vision for America’s AI future, but the details have been sparse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The White House’s AI Action Plan, released last week, is meant to fix that. Trump wants to boost the buildout of data centers by slashing environmental rules; withhold funding from states that pass “burdensome AI regulations”; and contract only with AI companies whose models are “free from top-down ideological bias.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if you dig deeper, certain parts of the plan that didn’t pop up in any headlines reveal more about where the administration’s AI plans are headed. Here are three of the most important issues to watch.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—James O'Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.
