It’s then concentrated into a biofuel and burned, which heats the towering boilers that power the facility—and releases carbon dioxide into the air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, JP MorganChase, and a tech company consortium that includes Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripe have all recently struck multimillion-dollar deals to pay paper mill owners to capture at least hundreds of thousands of tons of this greenhouse gas by installing carbon scrubbing equipment in their facilities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The captured carbon dioxide will then be piped down into saline aquifers more than a mile underground, where it should be sequestered permanently.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Big Tech is suddenly betting big on this form of carbon removal, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. The sector also includes biomass-fueled power plants, waste incinerators, and biofuel refineries that add carbon capturing equipment to their facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and these factories will trap emissions that would have gone into the air, together they can theoretically remove more greenhouse gas from the atmosphere than was released, achieving what’s known as “negative emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The companies that pay for this removal can apply that reduction in carbon dioxide to cancel out a share of their own corporate pollution. BECCS now accounts for nearly 70% of the announced contracts in carbon removal, a popularity due largely to the fact that it can be tacked onto industrial facilities already operating on large scales.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“If we’re balancing cost, time to market, and ultimate scale potential, BECCS offers a really attractive value proposition across all three of those,” says Brian Marrs, senior director of energy and carbon removal at Microsoft, which has become by far the largest buyer of carbon removal credits as it races to balance out its ongoing emissions by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But experts have raised a number of concerns about various approaches to BECCS, stressing they may inflate the climate benefits of the projects, conflate prevented emissions with carbon removal, and extend the life of facilities that pollute in other ways. It could also create greater financial incentives to log forests or convert them to agricultural land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When greenhouse-gas sources and sinks are properly tallied across all the fields, forests, and factories involved, it’s highly difficult to achieve negative emissions with many approaches to BECCS, says Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University. That undermines the logic of dedicating more of the world’s limited land, crops, and woods to such projects, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I call it a ‘BECCS and switch,’” he says, adding later: “It’s folly at some level.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The logic of BECCS&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For a biomass-fueled power plant, BECCS works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tree captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, sequestering the carbon in its bark, trunk, branches, and roots while releasing the oxygen. Someone then cuts it down, converts it into wood pellets, and delivers it to a power plant that, in turn, burns the wood to produce heat or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Usually, that facility will produce carbon dioxide as the wood incinerates. But under both European Union and US rules, the burning of the wood is generally treated as carbon neutral, so long as the timber forests are managed in sustainable ways and the various operations abide by other regulations. The argument is that the tree pulled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air in the first place, and new plant growth will bring that emissions debt back into balance over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that same power plant now captures a significant share of the greenhouse gas produced in the process and pumps it underground, the process can potentially go from carbon neutral to carbon negative.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the starting assumption that biomass is carbon neutral is fundamentally flawed, because it doesn’t fully take into account other ways that emissions are released throughout the process, according to Searchinger.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Among other things, a proper analysis must also ask: How much carbon is left behind in roots or branches on the forest floor that will begin to decompose and release greenhouse gases after the plant is removed? How much fossil fuel was burned in the process of cutting, collecting, and distributing the biomass? How much greenhouse gas was produced while converting timber into wood pellets and shipping them elsewhere? And how long will it take to grow back the trees or plants that would have otherwise continued capturing and storing carbon?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you’re harvesting wood, it’s essentially impossible to get negative emissions,” Searchinger says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Burning biomass, or the biofuels created from it, can also produce other forms of pollution that can harm human health, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preventing carbon dioxide emissions at a given factory may necessitate capturing certain other pollutants as well, notably sulfur dioxide. But it doesn’t necessarily filter out all the other pollution floating out of the flue stack, notes Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on carbon management issues and the transition away from fossil fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Driving demand&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea that we might be able to use biomass to generate energy and suck down carbon dates back decades. But as global temperatures and emissions both continued to rise, climate modelers found that more and more BECCS or other types of carbon removal would be needed to prevent the planet from tipping past increasingly dangerous warming thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to dramatic cuts in emissions, the world may need to suck down 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 and 20 billion by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a 2022 UN climate panel report. That’s a threshold we’re increasingly likely to blow past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These grave climate warnings sparked growing interest and investments in ways to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Companies sprang up offering to sink seaweed, bury biomass, develop carbon-sucking direct air capture factories, and add alkaline substances to agricultural fields or the oceans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But BECCS purchases have dwarfed those other approaches.&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;For companies with fast-approaching climate deadlines, BECCS is one of the few options for removing hundreds of thousands of tons over the next few years, says Robert Höglund, who cofounded CDR.fyi, ​​a public-benefit corporation that analyzes the carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you have a target you want to meet in 2030 and you want durable carbon removal, that’s the thing you can buy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s chiefly because these projects can harness the infrastructure of existing industries. At least for now, you don’t have to finance, permit, and develop new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They’re not that hard to build, because it’s often a retrofitting of an existing plant,” Höglund says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BECCS is also substantially less expensive for buyers than, say, direct air capture, with weighted average prices of $210 a ton compared with $490 among the deals to date, according to CDR.fyi. That’s in part because capturing the carbon dioxide from, say, a pulp and paper mill, where it makes up around 15% of flue gas, takes far less energy than plucking CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules out of the open air, where they account for just 0.04%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microsoft’s big BECCS bet&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Microsoft announced plans to become carbon negative by the end of this decade and, by midcentury, to remove all the emissions the company generated directly and from electricity use throughout its corporate history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s leaning particularly heavily on BECCS to meet those climate commitments, with the category accounting for 76% of its known carbon removal purchases to date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, the company announced it would purchase 3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide that a paper and pulp mill, located at some unspecified site in the southern US, will eventually capture and store over a 12-year period. It reached the deal through CO280, a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is forming joint ventures with paper and pulp mill companies in the US and Canada, to finance, develop, and operate the projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It was the biggest carbon removal purchase on record—until four days later, when Microsoft revealed it had agreed to buy 6.75 million tons of carbon removal from AtmosClear, CDR.fyi noted. That company is building a biomass power plant at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge in Louisiana, which will run largely on sugarcane bagasse (a by-product of sugar production) and forest trimmings. AtmosClear says the facility will be able to capture 680,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen is a lot of these BECCS projects have been very helpful, if not transformational, for providing investment in rural economies,” Marrs says. “We look at our BECCS deals, in Louisiana with AtmosClear and some other Gulf State providers, like CO280, as a real means of helping support these economies, while at the same time promoting sustainable forestry practices.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In earlier quarters, Microsoft also made substantial purchases from Orsted, which operates power plants that burn wood pellets; Gaia, which runs facilities that convert municipal waste into energy; and Arbor, whose plants are fueled by “overgrown brush, crop residues, and food waste.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t let waste go to waste&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notably, at least three of these projects rely on some form of waste, a category distinct from fresh-cut timber or crops grown for the purpose of fueling BECCS projects. Solid waste, agricultural residues, logging leftovers, and plant material removed from forests to prevent fires present some of the ripest opportunities for BECCS—as well as some difficult questions of carbon accounting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2019 report from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the US could achieve more than 500 million tons of carbon removal a year through BECCS by 2040, while the world could exceed 3.5 billion tons, by relying just on agricultural by-products, logging residues, and organic waste—without needing to grow crops dedicated to energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roger Aines, chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, argues we should at least be putting these sources to use rather than burning them or leaving them to decompose in fields. (Aines coauthored a similar analysis focused on California’s waste biomass and contributed to a 2022 lab report prepared for Microsoft to evaluate costs and options for carbon removal purchases.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He stresses that the BECCS sector can learn a lot from using that waste material. For example, it should help to provide a sharper sense of whether the carbon math will work if more land, forests, and crops are dedicated to these sorts of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The point is you won’t grow new material to do this in most cases, and won’t have to for a very long time, because there’s so much waste available,” Aines says. “If we get to that point, long into the future, we can address that then.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wonky accounting&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sugarcane bagasse, for instance, is or could also be used to produce recyclable packaging and paper, biodegradable food packaging and cutlery, building materials, or soil amendments that add nutrients back to agricultural fields.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of the time those materials are being used for something else already, so the accounting gets wonky really quickly,” Grubert says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some fear that the financial incentives to pursue BECCS could also compel companies to trim away more trees and plants than is truly necessary to, say, manage forests or prevent fires—particularly as more and more BECCS plants create greater and greater demand for the limited supplies of such materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Once you start capturing waste, you create an incentive to produce waste, so you have to be very careful about the perverse incentives,” says Danny Cullenward, a researcher and senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies carbon markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Due diligence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like other big tech companies, Microsoft has lost some momentum when it comes to its climate goals, in large part because of the surging energy demands of its AI data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the company has generally earned a reputation for striving to clean up its direct emissions where possible and for seeking out high-quality approaches to carbon removal. It has consulted extensively with critically minded researchers at advisory firms like Carbon Direct and demonstrated a willingness to pay higher prices to support more credible projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Marrs says the company has extended that scrutiny to its BECCS deals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want as much positive environmental impact as possible from every project,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re doing months and months of technical due diligence with teams that visit the site, that interview stakeholders, that produce a report for us that we go through in depth with a third-party engineering provider or technical perspective provider,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up statement, Microsoft stressed that it strives to validate that every BECCS project it supports will achieve negative emissions, whatever the fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Across all of these projects, we conducted substantial due diligence to ensure that BECCS feedstocks would otherwise return carbon to the atmosphere in a few years,” the company said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, Jonathan Rhone, the cofounder and chief executive of CO280, stresses that they’ve worked with consultants, carbon market registries, and pulp and paper mills “to make sure we’re adopting the best standards.” He says they strive to conservatively assess the release and uptake of greenhouse gases across the supply chain of the mills they work with, taking into account the type of biomass used by a given plant, the growth rate of the forests it’s harvested from, the distance trucks drive to ship the timber or sawmill residues, the total emissions of the facility, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rhone says its typical projects will capture and store away on the order of 850,000 to 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. How much that would make up of the plant’s total emissions would vary, based in part on how much of the facility’s energy comes from by-product biomatter and how much comes from fossil fuels. For its first projects, the company will aim to capture 50% to 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at the pulp and paper mills, but it eventually hopes to exceed 90%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up email, Rhone said the carbon capture equipment at the mills it works with will also prevent “substantial levels” of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions and might reduce emissions of other pollutants as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company is in active discussions with 10 pulp and paper mills in the Gulf Coast and Canada. Each carbon capture and storage project could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we’re trying to do at CO280 is show and demonstrate that we can create a stable, repeatable playbook for developing projects that are low risk and provide the market with what it wants, with what it needs,” Rhone says.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Proponents of BECCS say we could leverage biomass to deliver substantial volumes of carbon removal, so long as appropriate industry standards are put in place to prevent, or at least minimize, bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question is whether that will be the case—or whether, as the BECCS sector matures, it will veer closer to the pattern of carbon offset markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Studies and investigations have consistently shown that loosely regulated or poorly designed carbon credit and offset programs have allowed, if not invited, companies to significantly exaggerate the climate benefits of tree planting, forest preservation, and similar projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It appears to me to be something that will be manageable but that we’ll always have to keep an eye on,” Aines says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Magic&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even with all these carbon accounting complexities, BECCS projects can often deliver climate benefits, particularly for existing plants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding carbon capture to an operating paper and pulp mill, power plant, or refinery is at least an improvement over the status quo from a climate perspective, insofar as it prevents emissions that would otherwise have continued.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But ambitions for BECCS are already growing beyond existing plants: Last year Drax, the controversial UK power giant, announced plans to launch a Houston-based division tasked with developing enough new BECCS projects to deliver 6 million tons of carbon removal per year, in the US or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Numerous other companies have also built or proposed biomass power plants in recent years, with or without carbon capture systems—decisions driven in part by policies that classify them as carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if biomass &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;carbon neutral, as Searchinger and others argue it can’t be in many applications, then these new unfiltered power plants are just adding more emissions to the atmosphere—and BECCS projects aren’t drawing any out of the air. And if that’s the case, it raises tough questions about corporate climate claims that depend on its doing so and the societal trade-offs involved in building lots of new plants dedicated to these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s because crops grown for energy require land, fertilizer, insecticides, and human labor that might otherwise go toward producing food for an expanding global population. And greater demand for wood invites the timber industry to chop down more and more of the world’s forests, which are already sucking up and storing away vast amounts of carbon dioxide and providing homes for immense varieties of plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If these projects are merely preventing greenhouse gas from floating into the atmosphere but not drawing any down, we’re better off adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment to an existing natural-gas plant instead, Searchinger argues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Companies may think that harnessing nature to draw carbon dioxide out of the sky sounds better than cutting the emissions of a fossil-fuel turbine. But the electricity from the latter plant would cost dramatically less, the carbon capture system would reduce emissions more for the amount of same energy generated, and it would avoid the added pressures to cut down trees, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“People think some magic happens—this magic combination of using biomass and CCS creates something bigger than its parts,” Searchinger says. “But it’s not magic; it’s simply the sum of the two.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP24203458670422.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last century, much of the US pulp and paper industry crowded into the southeastern corner of the nation, setting up mills amid sprawling timber forests to strip the fibers from juvenile loblolly, long leaf, and slash pine trees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, after the factories chip the softwood and digest it into pulp, the leftover lignin, spent chemicals, and remaining organic matter form a dark, syrupy by-product known as black liquor.

 &lt;p&gt;“If we’re balancing cost, time to market, and ultimate scale potential, BECCS offers a really attractive value proposition across all three of those,” says Brian Marrs, senior director of energy and carbon removal at Microsoft, which has become by far the largest buyer of carbon removal credits as it races to balance out its ongoing emissions by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But experts have raised a number of concerns about various approaches to BECCS, stressing they may inflate the climate benefits of the projects, conflate prevented emissions with carbon removal, and extend the life of facilities that pollute in other ways. It could also create greater financial incentives to log forests or convert them to agricultural land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When greenhouse-gas sources and sinks are properly tallied across all the fields, forests, and factories involved, it’s highly difficult to achieve negative emissions with many approaches to BECCS, says Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University. That undermines the logic of dedicating more of the world’s limited land, crops, and woods to such projects, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I call it a ‘BECCS and switch,’” he says, adding later: “It’s folly at some level.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The logic of BECCS&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For a biomass-fueled power plant, BECCS works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tree captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, sequestering the carbon in its bark, trunk, branches, and roots while releasing the oxygen. Someone then cuts it down, converts it into wood pellets, and delivers it to a power plant that, in turn, burns the wood to produce heat or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Usually, that facility will produce carbon dioxide as the wood incinerates. But under both European Union and US rules, the burning of the wood is generally treated as carbon neutral, so long as the timber forests are managed in sustainable ways and the various operations abide by other regulations. The argument is that the tree pulled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air in the first place, and new plant growth will bring that emissions debt back into balance over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that same power plant now captures a significant share of the greenhouse gas produced in the process and pumps it underground, the process can potentially go from carbon neutral to carbon negative.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the starting assumption that biomass is carbon neutral is fundamentally flawed, because it doesn’t fully take into account other ways that emissions are released throughout the process, according to Searchinger.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Among other things, a proper analysis must also ask: How much carbon is left behind in roots or branches on the forest floor that will begin to decompose and release greenhouse gases after the plant is removed? How much fossil fuel was burned in the process of cutting, collecting, and distributing the biomass? How much greenhouse gas was produced while converting timber into wood pellets and shipping them elsewhere? And how long will it take to grow back the trees or plants that would have otherwise continued capturing and storing carbon?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you’re harvesting wood, it’s essentially impossible to get negative emissions,” Searchinger says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Burning biomass, or the biofuels created from it, can also produce other forms of pollution that can harm human health, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Preventing carbon dioxide emissions at a given factory may necessitate capturing certain other pollutants as well, notably sulfur dioxide. But it doesn’t necessarily filter out all the other pollution floating out of the flue stack, notes Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on carbon management issues and the transition away from fossil fuels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Driving demand&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea that we might be able to use biomass to generate energy and suck down carbon dates back decades. But as global temperatures and emissions both continued to rise, climate modelers found that more and more BECCS or other types of carbon removal would be needed to prevent the planet from tipping past increasingly dangerous warming thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to dramatic cuts in emissions, the world may need to suck down 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 and 20 billion by 2100 to limit warming to 2 °C over preindustrial levels, according to a 2022 UN climate panel report. That’s a threshold we’re increasingly likely to blow past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These grave climate warnings sparked growing interest and investments in ways to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Companies sprang up offering to sink seaweed, bury biomass, develop carbon-sucking direct air capture factories, and add alkaline substances to agricultural fields or the oceans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But BECCS purchases have dwarfed those other approaches.&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;For companies with fast-approaching climate deadlines, BECCS is one of the few options for removing hundreds of thousands of tons over the next few years, says Robert Höglund, who cofounded CDR.fyi, ​​a public-benefit corporation that analyzes the carbon removal sector.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you have a target you want to meet in 2030 and you want durable carbon removal, that’s the thing you can buy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That’s chiefly because these projects can harness the infrastructure of existing industries. At least for now, you don’t have to finance, permit, and develop new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“They’re not that hard to build, because it’s often a retrofitting of an existing plant,” Höglund says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BECCS is also substantially less expensive for buyers than, say, direct air capture, with weighted average prices of $210 a ton compared with $490 among the deals to date, according to CDR.fyi. That’s in part because capturing the carbon dioxide from, say, a pulp and paper mill, where it makes up around 15% of flue gas, takes far less energy than plucking CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules out of the open air, where they account for just 0.04%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microsoft’s big BECCS bet&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Microsoft announced plans to become carbon negative by the end of this decade and, by midcentury, to remove all the emissions the company generated directly and from electricity use throughout its corporate history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s leaning particularly heavily on BECCS to meet those climate commitments, with the category accounting for 76% of its known carbon removal purchases to date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In April, the company announced it would purchase 3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide that a paper and pulp mill, located at some unspecified site in the southern US, will eventually capture and store over a 12-year period. It reached the deal through CO280, a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is forming joint ventures with paper and pulp mill companies in the US and Canada, to finance, develop, and operate the projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It was the biggest carbon removal purchase on record—until four days later, when Microsoft revealed it had agreed to buy 6.75 million tons of carbon removal from AtmosClear, CDR.fyi noted. That company is building a biomass power plant at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge in Louisiana, which will run largely on sugarcane bagasse (a by-product of sugar production) and forest trimmings. AtmosClear says the facility will be able to capture 680,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen is a lot of these BECCS projects have been very helpful, if not transformational, for providing investment in rural economies,” Marrs says. “We look at our BECCS deals, in Louisiana with AtmosClear and some other Gulf State providers, like CO280, as a real means of helping support these economies, while at the same time promoting sustainable forestry practices.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In earlier quarters, Microsoft also made substantial purchases from Orsted, which operates power plants that burn wood pellets; Gaia, which runs facilities that convert municipal waste into energy; and Arbor, whose plants are fueled by “overgrown brush, crop residues, and food waste.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t let waste go to waste&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notably, at least three of these projects rely on some form of waste, a category distinct from fresh-cut timber or crops grown for the purpose of fueling BECCS projects. Solid waste, agricultural residues, logging leftovers, and plant material removed from forests to prevent fires present some of the ripest opportunities for BECCS—as well as some difficult questions of carbon accounting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2019 report from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the US could achieve more than 500 million tons of carbon removal a year through BECCS by 2040, while the world could exceed 3.5 billion tons, by relying just on agricultural by-products, logging residues, and organic waste—without needing to grow crops dedicated to energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Roger Aines, chief scientist of the energy program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, argues we should at least be putting these sources to use rather than burning them or leaving them to decompose in fields. (Aines coauthored a similar analysis focused on California’s waste biomass and contributed to a 2022 lab report prepared for Microsoft to evaluate costs and options for carbon removal purchases.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He stresses that the BECCS sector can learn a lot from using that waste material. For example, it should help to provide a sharper sense of whether the carbon math will work if more land, forests, and crops are dedicated to these sorts of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The point is you won’t grow new material to do this in most cases, and won’t have to for a very long time, because there’s so much waste available,” Aines says. “If we get to that point, long into the future, we can address that then.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wonky accounting&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the critical question that emerges with waste is: Would it otherwise have been burned or allowed to decompose, or might some of it have been used in some other way that kept the carbon out of the atmosphere?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sugarcane bagasse, for instance, is or could also be used to produce recyclable packaging and paper, biodegradable food packaging and cutlery, building materials, or soil amendments that add nutrients back to agricultural fields.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of the time those materials are being used for something else already, so the accounting gets wonky really quickly,” Grubert says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some fear that the financial incentives to pursue BECCS could also compel companies to trim away more trees and plants than is truly necessary to, say, manage forests or prevent fires—particularly as more and more BECCS plants create greater and greater demand for the limited supplies of such materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Once you start capturing waste, you create an incentive to produce waste, so you have to be very careful about the perverse incentives,” says Danny Cullenward, a researcher and senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies carbon markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Due diligence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like other big tech companies, Microsoft has lost some momentum when it comes to its climate goals, in large part because of the surging energy demands of its AI data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the company has generally earned a reputation for striving to clean up its direct emissions where possible and for seeking out high-quality approaches to carbon removal. It has consulted extensively with critically minded researchers at advisory firms like Carbon Direct and demonstrated a willingness to pay higher prices to support more credible projects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Marrs says the company has extended that scrutiny to its BECCS deals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We want as much positive environmental impact as possible from every project,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We’re doing months and months of technical due diligence with teams that visit the site, that interview stakeholders, that produce a report for us that we go through in depth with a third-party engineering provider or technical perspective provider,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up statement, Microsoft stressed that it strives to validate that every BECCS project it supports will achieve negative emissions, whatever the fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Across all of these projects, we conducted substantial due diligence to ensure that BECCS feedstocks would otherwise return carbon to the atmosphere in a few years,” the company said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, Jonathan Rhone, the cofounder and chief executive of CO280, stresses that they’ve worked with consultants, carbon market registries, and pulp and paper mills “to make sure we’re adopting the best standards.” He says they strive to conservatively assess the release and uptake of greenhouse gases across the supply chain of the mills they work with, taking into account the type of biomass used by a given plant, the growth rate of the forests it’s harvested from, the distance trucks drive to ship the timber or sawmill residues, the total emissions of the facility, and more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rhone says its typical projects will capture and store away on the order of 850,000 to 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. How much that would make up of the plant’s total emissions would vary, based in part on how much of the facility’s energy comes from by-product biomatter and how much comes from fossil fuels. For its first projects, the company will aim to capture 50% to 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at the pulp and paper mills, but it eventually hopes to exceed 90%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up email, Rhone said the carbon capture equipment at the mills it works with will also prevent “substantial levels” of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions and might reduce emissions of other pollutants as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company is in active discussions with 10 pulp and paper mills in the Gulf Coast and Canada. Each carbon capture and storage project could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What we’re trying to do at CO280 is show and demonstrate that we can create a stable, repeatable playbook for developing projects that are low risk and provide the market with what it wants, with what it needs,” Rhone says.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Proponents of BECCS say we could leverage biomass to deliver substantial volumes of carbon removal, so long as appropriate industry standards are put in place to prevent, or at least minimize, bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question is whether that will be the case—or whether, as the BECCS sector matures, it will veer closer to the pattern of carbon offset markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Studies and investigations have consistently shown that loosely regulated or poorly designed carbon credit and offset programs have allowed, if not invited, companies to significantly exaggerate the climate benefits of tree planting, forest preservation, and similar projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It appears to me to be something that will be manageable but that we’ll always have to keep an eye on,” Aines says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Magic&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even with all these carbon accounting complexities, BECCS projects can often deliver climate benefits, particularly for existing plants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adding carbon capture to an operating paper and pulp mill, power plant, or refinery is at least an improvement over the status quo from a climate perspective, insofar as it prevents emissions that would otherwise have continued.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But ambitions for BECCS are already growing beyond existing plants: Last year Drax, the controversial UK power giant, announced plans to launch a Houston-based division tasked with developing enough new BECCS projects to deliver 6 million tons of carbon removal per year, in the US or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Numerous other companies have also built or proposed biomass power plants in recent years, with or without carbon capture systems—decisions driven in part by policies that classify them as carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if biomass &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;carbon neutral, as Searchinger and others argue it can’t be in many applications, then these new unfiltered power plants are just adding more emissions to the atmosphere—and BECCS projects aren’t drawing any out of the air. And if that’s the case, it raises tough questions about corporate climate claims that depend on its doing so and the societal trade-offs involved in building lots of new plants dedicated to these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s because crops grown for energy require land, fertilizer, insecticides, and human labor that might otherwise go toward producing food for an expanding global population. And greater demand for wood invites the timber industry to chop down more and more of the world’s forests, which are already sucking up and storing away vast amounts of carbon dioxide and providing homes for immense varieties of plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If these projects are merely preventing greenhouse gas from floating into the atmosphere but not drawing any down, we’re better off adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment to an existing natural-gas plant instead, Searchinger argues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Companies may think that harnessing nature to draw carbon dioxide out of the sky sounds better than cutting the emissions of a fossil-fuel turbine. But the electricity from the latter plant would cost dramatically less, the carbon capture system would reduce emissions more for the amount of same energy generated, and it would avoid the added pressures to cut down trees, he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“People think some magic happens—this magic combination of using biomass and CCS creates something bigger than its parts,” Searchinger says. “But it’s not magic; it’s simply the sum of the two.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/15/1125715/big-techs-big-bet-on-a-controversial-carbon-removal-tactic/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Dfinity launches Caffeine, an AI platform that builds production apps from natural language prompts (AI | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/dfinity-launches-caffeine-an-ai-platform-that-builds-production-apps-from</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dfinity.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday released &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to build and deploy web applications through natural language conversation alone, bypassing traditional coding entirely. The system, which became publicly available today, represents a fundamental departure from existing AI coding assistants by building applications on a specialized decentralized infrastructure designed specifically for autonomous AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cursor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or other &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; tools that help human developers write code faster, Caffeine positions itself as a complete replacement for technical teams. Users describe what they want in plain language, and an ensemble of AI models writes, deploys, and continually updates production-grade applications — with no human intervention in the codebase itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the future, you as a prospective app owner or service owner… will talk to AI. AI will give you what you want on a URL,&amp;quot; said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at the Dfinity Foundation, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;You will use that, completely interact productively, and you&amp;#x27;ll just keep talking to AI to evolve what that does. The AI, or an ensemble of AIs, will be your tech team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has attracted significant early interest: more than 15,000 alpha users tested Caffeine before its public release, with daily active users representing 26% of those who received access codes — &amp;quot;early Facebook kind of levels,&amp;quot; according to Williams. The foundation reports some users spending entire days building applications on the platform, forcing Dfinity to consider usage limits due to underlying AI infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Caffeine&amp;#x27;s custom programming language guarantees your data won&amp;#x27;t disappear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s most significant technical claim addresses a problem that has plagued AI-generated code: data loss during application updates. The platform builds applications using &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Motoko&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a programming language developed by Dfinity specifically for AI use, which provides mathematical guarantees that upgrades cannot accidentally delete user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When AI is updating apps and services in production, a mistake cannot lose data. That&amp;#x27;s a guarantee,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not like there are some safeguards to try and stop it losing data. This language framework gives it rails that guarantee if an upgrade, an update to its app&amp;#x27;s underlying logic, would cause data loss, the upgrade fails and the AI just tries again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This addresses what Williams characterizes as critical failures in competing platforms. User forums for tools like &lt;a href="https://lovable.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lovable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he notes, frequently report three major problems: applications that become irreparably broken as complexity increases, security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, and mysterious data loss during updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional tech stacks evolved to meet human developer needs — familiarity with SQL databases, preference for known programming languages, existing skill investments. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s how the traditional tech stacks evolved. It&amp;#x27;s really evolved to meet human needs,&amp;quot; Williams explained. &amp;quot;But in the future, it&amp;#x27;s going to be different. You&amp;#x27;re not going to care how the AI did it. Instead, for you, AI is the tech stack.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s architecture reflects this philosophy. Applications run entirely on the &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a blockchain-based network that Dfinity launched in May 2021 after raising over $100 million from investors including &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/dfinity/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/dfinity/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Polychain Capital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ICP uses what Dfinity calls &amp;quot;chain-key cryptography&amp;quot; to create what Williams describes as &amp;quot;tamper-proof&amp;quot; code — applications that are mathematically guaranteed to execute their written logic without interference from traditional cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The code can&amp;#x27;t be affected by ransomware, so you don&amp;#x27;t have to worry about malware in the same way you do,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;Configuration errors don&amp;#x27;t result in traditional cyber attacks. That passive traditional cyber attacks isn&amp;#x27;t something you need to worry about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;orthogonal persistence&amp;#x27; lets AI build apps without managing databases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Caffeine&amp;#x27;s technical approach is a concept called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/orthogonal-persistence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;orthogonal persistence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which fundamentally reimagines how applications store and manage data. In traditional development, programmers must write extensive code to move data between application logic and separate database systems — marshaling data in and out of SQL servers, managing connections, handling synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Motoko&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eliminates this entirely. Williams demonstrated with a simple example: defining a blog post data type and declaring a variable to store an array of posts requires just two lines of code. &amp;quot;This declaration is all that&amp;#x27;s necessary to have the blog maintain its list of posts,&amp;quot; he explained during a presentation on the technology. &amp;quot;Compare that to traditional IT where in order to persist the blog posts, you&amp;#x27;d have to marshal them in and out of a database server. This is quite literally orders of magnitude more simple.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This abstraction allows AI to work at a higher conceptual level, focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. &amp;quot;Logic and data are kind of the same,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;This is one of the things that enables AI to build far more complicated functionality than it could otherwise do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also employs what Dfinity calls &amp;quot;loss-safe data migration.&amp;quot; When AI needs to modify an application&amp;#x27;s data structure — adding a &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot; field to blog posts, for example — it must write migration logic in two passes. The framework automatically verifies that the transformation won&amp;#x27;t result in data loss, refusing to compile or deploy code that could delete information unless explicitly instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From million-dollar SaaS contracts to conversational app building in minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams positions &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as particularly transformative for enterprise IT, where he claims costs could fall to &amp;quot;1% of what they were before&amp;quot; while time-to-market shrinks to similar fractions. The platform targets a spectrum from individual creators to large corporations, all of whom currently face either expensive development teams or constraining low-code templates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A corporation or government department might want to create a corporate portal or CRM, ERP functionality,&amp;quot; Williams said, referring to customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. &amp;quot;They will otherwise have to obtain this by signing up for some incredibly expensive SaaS service where they become locked in, their data gets stuck, and they still have to spend a lot of money on consultants customizing the functionality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications built through &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are owned entirely by their creators and cannot be shut down by centralized parties — a consequence of running on the decentralized &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; network rather than traditional cloud providers like &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=48ebaf74-0ade-44c7-b8c2-12a0e7718d21&amp;amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751059777!e!!g!!amazon%20web%20services!19852662197!145019195737&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=19852662197&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp-sA3cSfcBU924i9KU_I-qMh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;When someone says built on the internet computer, it actually means built on the internet computer,&amp;quot; Williams emphasized, contrasting this with blockchain projects that merely host tokens while running actual applications on centralized infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform demonstrated this versatility during a July 2025 hackathon in San Francisco, where participants created applications ranging from a &amp;quot;Will Maker&amp;quot; tool for generating legal documents, to &amp;quot;Blue Lens,&amp;quot; a voice-AI water quality monitoring system, to &amp;quot;Road Patrol,&amp;quot; a gamified community reporting app for infrastructure problems. Critically, many of these came from non-technical participants with no coding background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m from a non-technical background, I&amp;#x27;m actually a quality assurance professional,&amp;quot; said the creator of Blue Lens in a video testimonial. &amp;quot;Through Caffeine I can build something really intuitive and next-gen to the public.&amp;quot; The application integrated multiple external services — Eleven Labs for voice AI, real-time government water data through retrieval-augmented generation, and Midjourney-generated visual assets — all coordinated through conversational prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What separates Caffeine from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and the &amp;#x27;vibe coding&amp;#x27; wave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://caffeine.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enters a crowded market of AI-assisted development tools, but Williams argues the competition isn&amp;#x27;t truly comparable. &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cursor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and similar tools serve human developers working with traditional technology stacks. Platforms like &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://lovable.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lovable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occupy a middle ground, offering &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; that mixes AI generation with human editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a Node.js developer, you know you&amp;#x27;re working with the traditional stack, and you might want to do your coding with Copilot or using Claude or using Cursor,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s a very different thing to what Caffeine is offering. There&amp;#x27;ll always be cases where you probably wouldn&amp;#x27;t want to hand over the logic of the control system for a new nuclear missile silo to AI. But there&amp;#x27;s going to be these holdout areas, right? And there&amp;#x27;s all the legacy stuff that has to be maintained.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key distinction, according to Williams, lies in production readiness. Existing AI coding tools excel at rapid prototyping but stumble when applications grow complex or require guaranteed reliability. Reddit forums for these platforms document users hitting insurmountable walls where applications break irreparably, or where AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As the demands and the requirements become more complicated, eventually you can hit a limit, and when you hit that limit, not only can you not go any further, but sometimes your app will get broken and there&amp;#x27;s no way of going back to where you were before,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;That can&amp;#x27;t happen with productive apps, and it also can&amp;#x27;t be the case that you&amp;#x27;re getting hacked and losing data, because once you go hands-free, if you like, and there&amp;#x27;s no tech team, there&amp;#x27;s no technical people involved, who&amp;#x27;s going to run the backups and restore your app?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Computer&amp;#x27;s architecture addresses this through Byzantine fault tolerance — even if attackers gain physical control over some network hardware, they cannot corrupt applications or their data. &amp;quot;This is the beginning of a compute revolution and it&amp;#x27;s also the perfect platform for AI to build on,&amp;quot; Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the vision: A web that programs itself through natural language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dfinity frames &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within a broader vision it calls the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;self-writing internet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; where the web literally programs itself through natural language interaction. This represents what Williams describes as a &amp;quot;seismic shift coming to tech&amp;quot; — from human developers selecting technology stacks based on their existing skills, to AI selecting optimal implementations invisible to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#x27;t care about whether some human being has learned all of the different platforms and Amazon Web Services or something like that. You don&amp;#x27;t care about that. You just care: Is it secure? Do you get security guarantees? Is it resilient? What&amp;#x27;s the level of resilience?&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;Those are the new parameters.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform demonstrated this during live demonstrations, including at the &lt;a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich. Williams created a talent recruitment application from scratch in under two minutes, then modified it in real-time while the application ran with users already interacting with it. &amp;quot;You will continue talking to the AI and just keep on refreshing the URL to see the changes,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capability extends to complex scenarios. During demonstrations, Williams showed building a tennis lesson booking system, an e-commerce platform, and an event registration system — all simultaneously, working on multiple applications in parallel. &amp;quot;We predict that as people get very proficient with &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they could be working on even 10 apps in parallel,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system writes substantial code: a simple personal blog generated 700 lines of code in a couple of minutes. More complex applications can involve thousands of lines across frontend and backend components, all abstracted away from the user who only describes desired functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The economics of cloning: How Caffeine&amp;#x27;s app market challenges traditional stores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s economic model differs fundamentally from traditional software-as-a-service platforms. Applications run on the &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a &amp;quot;reverse gas model&amp;quot; where developers pay for computation rather than users paying transaction fees. The platform includes an integrated App Market where creators can publish applications for others to clone and adapt — creating what Dfinity envisions as a new economic ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;App stores today obviously operate on gatekeeping,&amp;quot; said Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at Dfinity, during the World Computer Summit. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s going to erode.&amp;quot; Rather than purchasing applications, users can clone them and modify them for their own purposes — fundamentally different from Apple&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;App Store&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams acknowledges that &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; itself currently runs on centralized infrastructure, despite building applications on the decentralized Internet Computer. &amp;quot;Caffeine itself actually is centralized. It uses aspects of the Internet Computer. We want Caffeine itself to run on the Internet Computer in the future, but it&amp;#x27;s not there now,&amp;quot; he said. The platform leverages commercially available foundation models from companies like Anthropic, whose &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Sonnet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; model powers much of Caffeine&amp;#x27;s backend logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pragmatic approach reflects Dfinity&amp;#x27;s strategy of using best-in-class AI models while focusing its own development on the specialized infrastructure and programming language designed for AI use. &amp;quot;These content models have been developed by companies with enormous budgets, absolutely enormous budgets,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t think in the near future we&amp;#x27;ll run AI on the Internet Computer for that reason, unless there&amp;#x27;s a special case.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A decade in the making: From Ethereum roots to the self-writing internet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dfinity.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has pursued this vision since Williams began researching decentralized networks in late 2013. After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a &amp;quot;world computer&amp;quot;—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,&amp;quot; Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that &amp;quot;in the future, the tech stack will be AI,&amp;quot; according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&amp;#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&amp;#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the &lt;a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is &lt;a href="https://oc.app/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenChat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. &amp;quot;The community is actually controlling the source code updates,&amp;quot; Williams explained. &amp;quot;Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&amp;#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. &amp;quot;The Web3 industry&amp;#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,&amp;quot; he said during the World Computer Summit. &amp;quot;Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&amp;#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation&amp;#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&amp;#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/dfinity-icp-ico.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;crashed below $3 in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/icp-cryptocurrency-crash.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alleging misleading investors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/column-new-york-times-crypto-analyst-beat-dfinity-defamation-claims-2023-11-14/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity filed defamation claims&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against industry critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. &amp;quot;Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&amp;#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,&amp;quot; Williams explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform&amp;#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;When five billion smartphone users become developers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. &amp;quot;The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_JleruySc"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit demonstration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. &amp;quot;Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&amp;#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hackathon results suggest this isn&amp;#x27;t pure hyperbole. A dentist built &amp;quot;Dental Tracks&amp;quot; to help patients manage their dental records. A transportation industry professional created &amp;quot;Road Patrol&amp;quot; for gamified infrastructure reporting. A frustrated knitting student built &amp;quot;Skill Sprout,&amp;quot; a garden-themed app for learning new hobbies, complete with material checklists and step-by-step skill breakdowns—all without writing a single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was learning to knit. I got irritated because I had the wrong materials,&amp;quot; the creator explained in a video interview. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know how to do the stitches, so I have to individually search, and it&amp;#x27;s really intimidating when you&amp;#x27;re trying to learn something you don&amp;#x27;t—you don&amp;#x27;t even know what you don&amp;#x27;t know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; succeeds depends on factors still unknown: how production applications perform under real-world stress, whether the Internet Computer scales to millions of applications, whether enterprises can overcome their skepticism of blockchain-adjacent technology. But if Williams is right about the fundamental shift — that AI will be the tech stack, not just a tool for human developers — then someone will build what Caffeine promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn&amp;#x27;t whether the future looks like this. It&amp;#x27;s who gets there first, and whether they can do it without losing everyone&amp;#x27;s data along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dfinity.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday released &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to build and deploy web applications through natural language conversation alone, bypassing traditional coding entirely. The system, which became publicly available today, represents a fundamental departure from existing AI coding assistants by building applications on a specialized decentralized infrastructure designed specifically for autonomous AI development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cursor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or other &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; tools that help human developers write code faster, Caffeine positions itself as a complete replacement for technical teams. Users describe what they want in plain language, and an ensemble of AI models writes, deploys, and continually updates production-grade applications — with no human intervention in the codebase itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the future, you as a prospective app owner or service owner… will talk to AI. AI will give you what you want on a URL,&amp;quot; said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at the Dfinity Foundation, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;You will use that, completely interact productively, and you&amp;#x27;ll just keep talking to AI to evolve what that does. The AI, or an ensemble of AIs, will be your tech team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has attracted significant early interest: more than 15,000 alpha users tested Caffeine before its public release, with daily active users representing 26% of those who received access codes — &amp;quot;early Facebook kind of levels,&amp;quot; according to Williams. The foundation reports some users spending entire days building applications on the platform, forcing Dfinity to consider usage limits due to underlying AI infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Caffeine&amp;#x27;s custom programming language guarantees your data won&amp;#x27;t disappear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s most significant technical claim addresses a problem that has plagued AI-generated code: data loss during application updates. The platform builds applications using &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Motoko&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a programming language developed by Dfinity specifically for AI use, which provides mathematical guarantees that upgrades cannot accidentally delete user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When AI is updating apps and services in production, a mistake cannot lose data. That&amp;#x27;s a guarantee,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not like there are some safeguards to try and stop it losing data. This language framework gives it rails that guarantee if an upgrade, an update to its app&amp;#x27;s underlying logic, would cause data loss, the upgrade fails and the AI just tries again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This addresses what Williams characterizes as critical failures in competing platforms. User forums for tools like &lt;a href="https://lovable.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lovable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he notes, frequently report three major problems: applications that become irreparably broken as complexity increases, security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, and mysterious data loss during updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional tech stacks evolved to meet human developer needs — familiarity with SQL databases, preference for known programming languages, existing skill investments. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s how the traditional tech stacks evolved. It&amp;#x27;s really evolved to meet human needs,&amp;quot; Williams explained. &amp;quot;But in the future, it&amp;#x27;s going to be different. You&amp;#x27;re not going to care how the AI did it. Instead, for you, AI is the tech stack.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s architecture reflects this philosophy. Applications run entirely on the &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a blockchain-based network that Dfinity launched in May 2021 after raising over $100 million from investors including &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/dfinity/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/dfinity/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Polychain Capital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ICP uses what Dfinity calls &amp;quot;chain-key cryptography&amp;quot; to create what Williams describes as &amp;quot;tamper-proof&amp;quot; code — applications that are mathematically guaranteed to execute their written logic without interference from traditional cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The code can&amp;#x27;t be affected by ransomware, so you don&amp;#x27;t have to worry about malware in the same way you do,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;Configuration errors don&amp;#x27;t result in traditional cyber attacks. That passive traditional cyber attacks isn&amp;#x27;t something you need to worry about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How &amp;#x27;orthogonal persistence&amp;#x27; lets AI build apps without managing databases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Caffeine&amp;#x27;s technical approach is a concept called &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/orthogonal-persistence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;orthogonal persistence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which fundamentally reimagines how applications store and manage data. In traditional development, programmers must write extensive code to move data between application logic and separate database systems — marshaling data in and out of SQL servers, managing connections, handling synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Motoko&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eliminates this entirely. Williams demonstrated with a simple example: defining a blog post data type and declaring a variable to store an array of posts requires just two lines of code. &amp;quot;This declaration is all that&amp;#x27;s necessary to have the blog maintain its list of posts,&amp;quot; he explained during a presentation on the technology. &amp;quot;Compare that to traditional IT where in order to persist the blog posts, you&amp;#x27;d have to marshal them in and out of a database server. This is quite literally orders of magnitude more simple.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This abstraction allows AI to work at a higher conceptual level, focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. &amp;quot;Logic and data are kind of the same,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;This is one of the things that enables AI to build far more complicated functionality than it could otherwise do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also employs what Dfinity calls &amp;quot;loss-safe data migration.&amp;quot; When AI needs to modify an application&amp;#x27;s data structure — adding a &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot; field to blog posts, for example — it must write migration logic in two passes. The framework automatically verifies that the transformation won&amp;#x27;t result in data loss, refusing to compile or deploy code that could delete information unless explicitly instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;From million-dollar SaaS contracts to conversational app building in minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams positions &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as particularly transformative for enterprise IT, where he claims costs could fall to &amp;quot;1% of what they were before&amp;quot; while time-to-market shrinks to similar fractions. The platform targets a spectrum from individual creators to large corporations, all of whom currently face either expensive development teams or constraining low-code templates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A corporation or government department might want to create a corporate portal or CRM, ERP functionality,&amp;quot; Williams said, referring to customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. &amp;quot;They will otherwise have to obtain this by signing up for some incredibly expensive SaaS service where they become locked in, their data gets stuck, and they still have to spend a lot of money on consultants customizing the functionality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications built through &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are owned entirely by their creators and cannot be shut down by centralized parties — a consequence of running on the decentralized &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; network rather than traditional cloud providers like &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=48ebaf74-0ade-44c7-b8c2-12a0e7718d21&amp;amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751059777!e!!g!!amazon%20web%20services!19852662197!145019195737&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=19852662197&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp-sA3cSfcBU924i9KU_I-qMh&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;When someone says built on the internet computer, it actually means built on the internet computer,&amp;quot; Williams emphasized, contrasting this with blockchain projects that merely host tokens while running actual applications on centralized infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform demonstrated this versatility during a July 2025 hackathon in San Francisco, where participants created applications ranging from a &amp;quot;Will Maker&amp;quot; tool for generating legal documents, to &amp;quot;Blue Lens,&amp;quot; a voice-AI water quality monitoring system, to &amp;quot;Road Patrol,&amp;quot; a gamified community reporting app for infrastructure problems. Critically, many of these came from non-technical participants with no coding background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m from a non-technical background, I&amp;#x27;m actually a quality assurance professional,&amp;quot; said the creator of Blue Lens in a video testimonial. &amp;quot;Through Caffeine I can build something really intuitive and next-gen to the public.&amp;quot; The application integrated multiple external services — Eleven Labs for voice AI, real-time government water data through retrieval-augmented generation, and Midjourney-generated visual assets — all coordinated through conversational prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What separates Caffeine from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and the &amp;#x27;vibe coding&amp;#x27; wave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://caffeine.ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enters a crowded market of AI-assisted development tools, but Williams argues the competition isn&amp;#x27;t truly comparable. &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/copilot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cursor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and similar tools serve human developers working with traditional technology stacks. Platforms like &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://lovable.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lovable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occupy a middle ground, offering &amp;quot;vibe coding&amp;quot; that mixes AI generation with human editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a Node.js developer, you know you&amp;#x27;re working with the traditional stack, and you might want to do your coding with Copilot or using Claude or using Cursor,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s a very different thing to what Caffeine is offering. There&amp;#x27;ll always be cases where you probably wouldn&amp;#x27;t want to hand over the logic of the control system for a new nuclear missile silo to AI. But there&amp;#x27;s going to be these holdout areas, right? And there&amp;#x27;s all the legacy stuff that has to be maintained.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key distinction, according to Williams, lies in production readiness. Existing AI coding tools excel at rapid prototyping but stumble when applications grow complex or require guaranteed reliability. Reddit forums for these platforms document users hitting insurmountable walls where applications break irreparably, or where AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As the demands and the requirements become more complicated, eventually you can hit a limit, and when you hit that limit, not only can you not go any further, but sometimes your app will get broken and there&amp;#x27;s no way of going back to where you were before,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;That can&amp;#x27;t happen with productive apps, and it also can&amp;#x27;t be the case that you&amp;#x27;re getting hacked and losing data, because once you go hands-free, if you like, and there&amp;#x27;s no tech team, there&amp;#x27;s no technical people involved, who&amp;#x27;s going to run the backups and restore your app?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Computer&amp;#x27;s architecture addresses this through Byzantine fault tolerance — even if attackers gain physical control over some network hardware, they cannot corrupt applications or their data. &amp;quot;This is the beginning of a compute revolution and it&amp;#x27;s also the perfect platform for AI to build on,&amp;quot; Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the vision: A web that programs itself through natural language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dfinity frames &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within a broader vision it calls the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;self-writing internet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; where the web literally programs itself through natural language interaction. This represents what Williams describes as a &amp;quot;seismic shift coming to tech&amp;quot; — from human developers selecting technology stacks based on their existing skills, to AI selecting optimal implementations invisible to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#x27;t care about whether some human being has learned all of the different platforms and Amazon Web Services or something like that. You don&amp;#x27;t care about that. You just care: Is it secure? Do you get security guarantees? Is it resilient? What&amp;#x27;s the level of resilience?&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;Those are the new parameters.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform demonstrated this during live demonstrations, including at the &lt;a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich. Williams created a talent recruitment application from scratch in under two minutes, then modified it in real-time while the application ran with users already interacting with it. &amp;quot;You will continue talking to the AI and just keep on refreshing the URL to see the changes,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This capability extends to complex scenarios. During demonstrations, Williams showed building a tennis lesson booking system, an e-commerce platform, and an event registration system — all simultaneously, working on multiple applications in parallel. &amp;quot;We predict that as people get very proficient with &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they could be working on even 10 apps in parallel,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system writes substantial code: a simple personal blog generated 700 lines of code in a couple of minutes. More complex applications can involve thousands of lines across frontend and backend components, all abstracted away from the user who only describes desired functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The economics of cloning: How Caffeine&amp;#x27;s app market challenges traditional stores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine&amp;#x27;s economic model differs fundamentally from traditional software-as-a-service platforms. Applications run on the &lt;a href="https://internetcomputer.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet Computer Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a &amp;quot;reverse gas model&amp;quot; where developers pay for computation rather than users paying transaction fees. The platform includes an integrated App Market where creators can publish applications for others to clone and adapt — creating what Dfinity envisions as a new economic ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;App stores today obviously operate on gatekeeping,&amp;quot; said Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at Dfinity, during the World Computer Summit. &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s going to erode.&amp;quot; Rather than purchasing applications, users can clone them and modify them for their own purposes — fundamentally different from Apple&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;App Store&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams acknowledges that &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; itself currently runs on centralized infrastructure, despite building applications on the decentralized Internet Computer. &amp;quot;Caffeine itself actually is centralized. It uses aspects of the Internet Computer. We want Caffeine itself to run on the Internet Computer in the future, but it&amp;#x27;s not there now,&amp;quot; he said. The platform leverages commercially available foundation models from companies like Anthropic, whose &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claude Sonnet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; model powers much of Caffeine&amp;#x27;s backend logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pragmatic approach reflects Dfinity&amp;#x27;s strategy of using best-in-class AI models while focusing its own development on the specialized infrastructure and programming language designed for AI use. &amp;quot;These content models have been developed by companies with enormous budgets, absolutely enormous budgets,&amp;quot; Williams said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t think in the near future we&amp;#x27;ll run AI on the Internet Computer for that reason, unless there&amp;#x27;s a special case.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A decade in the making: From Ethereum roots to the self-writing internet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dfinity.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has pursued this vision since Williams began researching decentralized networks in late 2013. After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a &amp;quot;world computer&amp;quot;—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,&amp;quot; Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that &amp;quot;in the future, the tech stack will be AI,&amp;quot; according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&amp;#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&amp;#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the &lt;a href="https://worldcomputer.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is &lt;a href="https://oc.app/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenChat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. &amp;quot;The community is actually controlling the source code updates,&amp;quot; Williams explained. &amp;quot;Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&amp;#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. &amp;quot;The Web3 industry&amp;#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,&amp;quot; he said during the World Computer Summit. &amp;quot;Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&amp;#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation&amp;#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&amp;#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/dfinity-icp-ico.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;crashed below $3 in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/icp-cryptocurrency-crash.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alleging misleading investors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/column-new-york-times-crypto-analyst-beat-dfinity-defamation-claims-2023-11-14/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dfinity filed defamation claims&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against industry critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. &amp;quot;Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&amp;#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,&amp;quot; Williams explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform&amp;#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;When five billion smartphone users become developers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. &amp;quot;The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_JleruySc"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Computer Summit demonstration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. &amp;quot;Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&amp;#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hackathon results suggest this isn&amp;#x27;t pure hyperbole. A dentist built &amp;quot;Dental Tracks&amp;quot; to help patients manage their dental records. A transportation industry professional created &amp;quot;Road Patrol&amp;quot; for gamified infrastructure reporting. A frustrated knitting student built &amp;quot;Skill Sprout,&amp;quot; a garden-themed app for learning new hobbies, complete with material checklists and step-by-step skill breakdowns—all without writing a single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was learning to knit. I got irritated because I had the wrong materials,&amp;quot; the creator explained in a video interview. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know how to do the stitches, so I have to individually search, and it&amp;#x27;s really intimidating when you&amp;#x27;re trying to learn something you don&amp;#x27;t—you don&amp;#x27;t even know what you don&amp;#x27;t know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;a href="https://caffeine.ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Caffeine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; succeeds depends on factors still unknown: how production applications perform under real-world stress, whether the Internet Computer scales to millions of applications, whether enterprises can overcome their skepticism of blockchain-adjacent technology. But if Williams is right about the fundamental shift — that AI will be the tech stack, not just a tool for human developers — then someone will build what Caffeine promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn&amp;#x27;t whether the future looks like this. It&amp;#x27;s who gets there first, and whether they can do it without losing everyone&amp;#x27;s data along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Baird, a former nurse who was then the facility’s director of quality, describes it as “a tick‑box exercise where people weren’t truly considering pain indicators.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, agitated residents were assumed to have behavioral issues, since the scale does not always differentiate well between pain and other forms of suffering or distress. They were often prescribed psychotropic sedatives, while the pain itself went untreated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in January 2021, Orchard Care Homes began a trial of PainChek, a smartphone app that scans a resident’s face for microscopic muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output an expected pain score. Within weeks, the pilot unit saw fewer prescriptions and had calmer corridors. “We immediately saw the benefits: ease of use, accuracy, and identifying pain that wouldn’t have been spotted using the old scale,” Baird recalls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This kind of technology-assisted diagnosis hints at a bigger trend. In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain—medicine’s most subjective vital sign—into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure. The push has already produced PainChek, which has been cleared by regulators on three continents and has logged more than 10 million pain assessments. Other startups are beginning to make similar inroads in care settings.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The way we assess pain may finally be shifting, but when algorithms measure our suffering, does that change the way we understand and treat it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Science already understands certain aspects of pain. We know that when you stub your toe, for example, microscopic alarm bells called nociceptors send electrical impulses toward your spinal cord on “express” wires, delivering the first stab of pain, while a slower convoy follows with the dull throb that lingers. At the spinal cord, the signal meets a microscopic switchboard scientists call the gate. Flood that gate with friendly touches—say, by rubbing the bruise—or let the brain return an instruction born of panic or calm, and the gate might muffle or magnify the message before you even become aware of it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gate can either let pain signals pass through or block them, depending on other nerve activity and instructions from your brain. Only the signals that succeed in getting past this gate travel up to your brain’s sensory map to help locate the damage, while others branch out to emotion centers that decide how bad it feels. Within milliseconds, those same hubs in the brain shoot fresh orders back down the line, releasing built-in painkillers or stoking the alarm. In other words, pain isn’t a straightforward translation of damage or sensation but a live negotiation between the body and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But much of how that negotiation plays out is still a mystery. For instance, scientists cannot predict what causes someone to slip from a routine injury into years-long hypersensitivity; the molecular shift from acute to chronic pain is still largely unknown. Phantom-limb pain remains equally puzzling: About two-thirds of amputees feel agony in a part of their body that no longer exists, yet competing theories—cortical remapping, peripheral neuromas, body-schema mismatch—do not explain why they suffer while the other third feel nothing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first serious attempt at a system for quantifying pain was introduced in 1921. Patients marked their degree of pain as a point on a blank 10‑centimeter line and clinicians scored the distance in millimeters, converting lived experience into a 0–100 ladder. By 1975, psychologist Ronald Melzack’s McGill Pain Questionnaire offered 78 adjectives like “burning,” “stabbing,” and “throbbing,” so that pain’s texture could join intensity in the chart. Over the past few decades, hospitals have ultimately settled on the 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet pain is stubbornly subjective. Feedback from the brain in the form of your reaction can send instructions back down the spinal cord, meaning that expectation and emotion can change how much the same injury hurts. In one trial, volunteers who believed they had received a pain relief cream reported a stimulus as 22% less painful than those who knew the cream was inactive—and a functional magnetic resonance image of their brains showed that the drop corresponded with decreased activity in the parts of the brain that report pain, meaning they really did feel less hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, pain can also be affected by a slew of external factors. In one study, experimenters applied the same calibrated electrical stimulus to volunteers from Italy, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia, and the ratings varied dramatically. Italian women recorded the highest scores on the 0–10 scale, while Swedish and Saudi participants judged the identical burn several points lower, implying that culture can amplify or dampen the felt intensity of the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bias inside the clinic can drive different responses even to the same pain score. A 2024 analysis of discharge notes found that women’s scores were recorded 10% less often than men’s. At a large pediatric emergency department, Black children presenting with limb fractures were roughly 39% less likely to receive an opioid analgesic than their white non-Hispanic peers, even after the researchers controlled for pain score and other clinical factors. Together these studies make clear that an “8 out of 10” does not always result in the same reaction or treatment. And many patients cannot self-report their pain at all—for example, a review of bedside studies concludes that about 70% of intensive-care patients have pain that goes unrecognized or undertreated, a problem the authors link to their impaired communication due to sedation or intubation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These issues have prompted a search for a better, more objective way to understand and assess pain. Progress in artificial intelligence has brought a new dimension to that hunt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Research groups are pursuing two broad routes. The first listens underneath the skin. Electrophysiologists strap electrode nets to volunteers and look for neural signatures that rise and fall with administered stimuli. A 2024 machine-learning study reported that one such algorithm could tell with over 80% accuracy, using a few minutes of resting-state EEG, which subjects experienced chronic pain and which were pain-free control participants. Other researchers combine EEG with galvanic skin response and heart-rate variability, hoping a multisignal “pain fingerprint” will provide more robust measurements.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One example of this method is the PMD-200 patient monitor from Medasense, which uses AI-based tools to output pain scores. The device uses physiological patterns like heart rate, sweating, or peripheral temperature changes as the input and focuses on surgical patients, with the goal of helping anesthesiologists adjust doses during operations. In a 2022 study of 75 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of the monitor resulted in lower self-reported pain scores after the operation—a median score of 3 out of 10, versus 5 out of 10 in controls—without an increase in opioid use. The device is authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and is in use in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second path is behavioral. A grimace, a guarded posture, or a sharp intake of breath correlates with various levels of pain. Computer-vision teams have fed high-speed video of patients’ changing expressions into neural networks trained on the Face Action Coding System (FACS), which was introduced in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an objective and universal system to analyze such expressions—it’s the Rosetta stone of 44 facial micro-movements. In lab tests, those models can flag frames indicating pain from the data set with over 90% accuracy, edging close to the consistency of expert human assessors. Similar approaches mine posture and even sentence fragments in clinical notes, using natural-language processing, to spot phrases like “curling knees to chest” that often correlate with high pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PainChek is one of these behavioral models, and it acts like a camera‑based thermometer, but for pain: A care worker opens the app and holds a phone 30 centimeters from a person’s face. For three seconds, a neural network looks for nine particular microscopic movements—upper‑lip raise, brow pinch, cheek tension, and so on—that research has linked most strongly to pain. Then the screen flashes a score of 0 to 42. “There’s a catalogue of ‘action‑unit codes’—facial expressions common to all humans. Nine of those are associated with pain,” explains Kreshnik Hoti, a senior research scientist with PainChek and a co-inventor of the device. This system is built directly on the foundation of FACS. After the scan, the app walks the user through a yes‑or‑no checklist of other signs, like groaning, “guarding,” and sleep disruption, and stores the result on a cloud dashboard that can show trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Linking the scan to a human‑filled checklist was, Hoti admits, a late design choice. “Initially, we thought AI should automate everything, but now we see [that] hybrid use—AI plus human input—is our major strength,” he says. Care aides, not nurses, complete most assessments, freeing clinicians to act on the data rather than gather it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PainChek was cleared by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration in 2017, and national rollout funding from Canberra helped embed it in hundreds of nursing homes in the country. The system has also won authorization in the UK—where expansion began just before covid-19 started spreading and resumed as lockdowns eased—and in Canada and New Zealand, which are running pilot programs. In the US, it’s currently awaiting an FDA decision. Company‑wide data show “about a 25% drop in anti­psychotic use and, in Scotland, a 42% reduction in falls,” Hoti says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="a person holding a phone up in front of an elderly person, whose face is visible on the screen" class="wp-image-1125454" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PainChek-Montage-3.jpg?w=618" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;PainChek is a mobile app that estimates pain scores by applying artificial intelligence to facial scans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF PAINCHEK&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orchard Care Homes is one of its early adopters. Baird, then the facility’s director of quality, remembers the pre‑AI routine that was largely done “to prove compliance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PainChek added an algorithm to that workflow, and the hybrid approach has paid off. Orchard’s internal study of four care homes tracked monthly pain scores, behavioral incidents, and prescriptions. Within weeks, psychotropic scripts fell and residents’ behavior calmed. The ripple effects went beyond pharmacy tallies. Residents who had skipped meals because of undetected dental pain “began eating again,” Baird notes, and “those who were isolated due to pain began socializing.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inside Orchard facilities, a cultural shift is underway. When Baird trained new staff, she likened pain “to measuring blood pressure or oxygen,” she says. “We wouldn’t guess those, so why guess pain?” The analogy lands, but getting people fully on board is still a slog. Some nurses insist their clinical judgment is enough; others balk at another login and audit trail. “The sector has been slow to adopt technology, but it’s changing,” Baird says. That’s helped by the fact that administering a full Abbey Pain Scale takes 20 minutes, while a PainChek scan and checklist take less than five.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Engineers at PainChek are now adapting the code for the very youngest patients. PainChek Infant targets babies under one year, whose grimaces flicker faster than adults’. The algorithm, retrained on neonatal faces, detects six validated facial action units based on the well-established Baby Facial Action Coding System. PainChek Infant is starting limited testing in Australia while the company pursues a separate regulatory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skeptics raise familiar red flags about these devices. Facial‑analysis AI has a history of skin‑tone bias, for example. Facial analysis may also misread grimaces stemming from nausea or fear. The tool is only as good as the yes‑or‑no answers that follow the scan; sloppy data entry can skew results in either direction. Results lack the broader clinical and interpersonal context a caregiver is likely to have from interacting with individual patients regularly and understanding their medical history. It’s also possible that clinicians might defer too strongly to the algorithm, over-relying on outside judgment and eroding their own.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If PainChek is approved by the FDA this fall, it will be part of a broader effort to create a system of new pain measurement technology. Other startups are pitching EEG headbands for neuropathic pain, galvanic skin sensors that flag breakthrough cancer pain, and even language models that comb nursing notes for evidence of hidden distress. Still, quantifying pain with an external device could be rife with hidden issues, like bias or inaccuracies, that we will uncover only after significant use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Baird, the issue is fairly straightforward nonetheless. “I’ve lived with chronic pain and had a hard time getting people to believe me. [PainChek] would have made a huge difference,” she says. If artificial intelligence can give silent sufferers a numerical voice—and make clinicians listen—then adding one more line to the vital‑sign chart might be worth the screen time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deena Mousa is a researcher, grantmaker, and journalist focused on global health, economic development, and scientific and technological progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mousa is employed as lead researcher by Open Philanthropy, a funder and adviser focused on high-impact causes, including global health and the potential risks posed by AI.

Baird, a former nurse who was then the facility’s director of quality, describes it as “a tick‑box exercise where people weren’t truly considering pain indicators.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, agitated residents were assumed to have behavioral issues, since the scale does not always differentiate well between pain and other forms of suffering or distress. They were often prescribed psychotropic sedatives, while the pain itself went untreated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in January 2021, Orchard Care Homes began a trial of PainChek, a smartphone app that scans a resident’s face for microscopic muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output an expected pain score. Within weeks, the pilot unit saw fewer prescriptions and had calmer corridors. “We immediately saw the benefits: ease of use, accuracy, and identifying pain that wouldn’t have been spotted using the old scale,” Baird recalls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This kind of technology-assisted diagnosis hints at a bigger trend. In nursing homes, neonatal units, and ICU wards, researchers are racing to turn pain—medicine’s most subjective vital sign—into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure. The push has already produced PainChek, which has been cleared by regulators on three continents and has logged more than 10 million pain assessments. Other startups are beginning to make similar inroads in care settings.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The way we assess pain may finally be shifting, but when algorithms measure our suffering, does that change the way we understand and treat it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Science already understands certain aspects of pain. We know that when you stub your toe, for example, microscopic alarm bells called nociceptors send electrical impulses toward your spinal cord on “express” wires, delivering the first stab of pain, while a slower convoy follows with the dull throb that lingers. At the spinal cord, the signal meets a microscopic switchboard scientists call the gate. Flood that gate with friendly touches—say, by rubbing the bruise—or let the brain return an instruction born of panic or calm, and the gate might muffle or magnify the message before you even become aware of it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gate can either let pain signals pass through or block them, depending on other nerve activity and instructions from your brain. Only the signals that succeed in getting past this gate travel up to your brain’s sensory map to help locate the damage, while others branch out to emotion centers that decide how bad it feels. Within milliseconds, those same hubs in the brain shoot fresh orders back down the line, releasing built-in painkillers or stoking the alarm. In other words, pain isn’t a straightforward translation of damage or sensation but a live negotiation between the body and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But much of how that negotiation plays out is still a mystery. For instance, scientists cannot predict what causes someone to slip from a routine injury into years-long hypersensitivity; the molecular shift from acute to chronic pain is still largely unknown. Phantom-limb pain remains equally puzzling: About two-thirds of amputees feel agony in a part of their body that no longer exists, yet competing theories—cortical remapping, peripheral neuromas, body-schema mismatch—do not explain why they suffer while the other third feel nothing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first serious attempt at a system for quantifying pain was introduced in 1921. Patients marked their degree of pain as a point on a blank 10‑centimeter line and clinicians scored the distance in millimeters, converting lived experience into a 0–100 ladder. By 1975, psychologist Ronald Melzack’s McGill Pain Questionnaire offered 78 adjectives like “burning,” “stabbing,” and “throbbing,” so that pain’s texture could join intensity in the chart. Over the past few decades, hospitals have ultimately settled on the 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet pain is stubbornly subjective. Feedback from the brain in the form of your reaction can send instructions back down the spinal cord, meaning that expectation and emotion can change how much the same injury hurts. In one trial, volunteers who believed they had received a pain relief cream reported a stimulus as 22% less painful than those who knew the cream was inactive—and a functional magnetic resonance image of their brains showed that the drop corresponded with decreased activity in the parts of the brain that report pain, meaning they really did feel less hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, pain can also be affected by a slew of external factors. In one study, experimenters applied the same calibrated electrical stimulus to volunteers from Italy, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia, and the ratings varied dramatically. Italian women recorded the highest scores on the 0–10 scale, while Swedish and Saudi participants judged the identical burn several points lower, implying that culture can amplify or dampen the felt intensity of the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bias inside the clinic can drive different responses even to the same pain score. A 2024 analysis of discharge notes found that women’s scores were recorded 10% less often than men’s. At a large pediatric emergency department, Black children presenting with limb fractures were roughly 39% less likely to receive an opioid analgesic than their white non-Hispanic peers, even after the researchers controlled for pain score and other clinical factors. Together these studies make clear that an “8 out of 10” does not always result in the same reaction or treatment. And many patients cannot self-report their pain at all—for example, a review of bedside studies concludes that about 70% of intensive-care patients have pain that goes unrecognized or undertreated, a problem the authors link to their impaired communication due to sedation or intubation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These issues have prompted a search for a better, more objective way to understand and assess pain. Progress in artificial intelligence has brought a new dimension to that hunt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Research groups are pursuing two broad routes. The first listens underneath the skin. Electrophysiologists strap electrode nets to volunteers and look for neural signatures that rise and fall with administered stimuli. A 2024 machine-learning study reported that one such algorithm could tell with over 80% accuracy, using a few minutes of resting-state EEG, which subjects experienced chronic pain and which were pain-free control participants. Other researchers combine EEG with galvanic skin response and heart-rate variability, hoping a multisignal “pain fingerprint” will provide more robust measurements.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;One example of this method is the PMD-200 patient monitor from Medasense, which uses AI-based tools to output pain scores. The device uses physiological patterns like heart rate, sweating, or peripheral temperature changes as the input and focuses on surgical patients, with the goal of helping anesthesiologists adjust doses during operations. In a 2022 study of 75 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of the monitor resulted in lower self-reported pain scores after the operation—a median score of 3 out of 10, versus 5 out of 10 in controls—without an increase in opioid use. The device is authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration and is in use in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second path is behavioral. A grimace, a guarded posture, or a sharp intake of breath correlates with various levels of pain. Computer-vision teams have fed high-speed video of patients’ changing expressions into neural networks trained on the Face Action Coding System (FACS), which was introduced in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an objective and universal system to analyze such expressions—it’s the Rosetta stone of 44 facial micro-movements. In lab tests, those models can flag frames indicating pain from the data set with over 90% accuracy, edging close to the consistency of expert human assessors. Similar approaches mine posture and even sentence fragments in clinical notes, using natural-language processing, to spot phrases like “curling knees to chest” that often correlate with high pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PainChek is one of these behavioral models, and it acts like a camera‑based thermometer, but for pain: A care worker opens the app and holds a phone 30 centimeters from a person’s face. For three seconds, a neural network looks for nine particular microscopic movements—upper‑lip raise, brow pinch, cheek tension, and so on—that research has linked most strongly to pain. Then the screen flashes a score of 0 to 42. “There’s a catalogue of ‘action‑unit codes’—facial expressions common to all humans. Nine of those are associated with pain,” explains Kreshnik Hoti, a senior research scientist with PainChek and a co-inventor of the device. This system is built directly on the foundation of FACS. After the scan, the app walks the user through a yes‑or‑no checklist of other signs, like groaning, “guarding,” and sleep disruption, and stores the result on a cloud dashboard that can show trends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Linking the scan to a human‑filled checklist was, Hoti admits, a late design choice. “Initially, we thought AI should automate everything, but now we see [that] hybrid use—AI plus human input—is our major strength,” he says.

Libby Cowgill, an anthropologist in a furry parka, has wheeled me and my cot into a metal-walled room set to 40 °F. A loud fan pummels me from above and siphons the dregs of my body heat through the cot’s mesh from below. A large respirator fits snug over my nose and mouth. The device tracks carbon dioxide in my exhales—a proxy for how my metabolism speeds up or slows down throughout the experiment. Eventually Cowgill will remove my respirator to slip a wire-thin metal temperature probe several pointy inches into my nose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cowgill and a graduate student quietly observe me from the corner of their so-called “climate chamber.&lt;sup&gt;”&lt;/sup&gt; Just a few hours earlier I’d sat beside them to observe as another volunteer, a 24-year-old personal trainer, endured the cold. Every few minutes, they measured his skin temperature with a thermal camera, his core temperature with a wireless pill, and his blood pressure and other metrics that hinted at how his body handles extreme cold. He lasted almost an hour without shivering; when my turn comes, I shiver aggressively on the cot for nearly an hour straight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m visiting Texas to learn about this experiment on how different bodies respond to extreme climates. “What’s the record for fastest to shiver so far?” I jokingly ask Cowgill as she tapes biosensing devices to my chest and legs. After I exit the cold, she surprises me: “You, believe it or not, were not the worst person we’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change forces us to reckon with the knotty science of how our bodies interact with the environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cowgill is a 40-something anthropologist at the University of Missouri who powerlifts and teaches CrossFit in her spare time. She’s small and strong, with dark bangs and geometric tattoos. Since 2022, she’s spent the summers at the University of North Texas Health Science Center tending to these uncomfortable experiments. Her team hopes to revamp the science of thermoregulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;While we know in broad strokes how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. “We have the general picture. We don’t have a lot of the specifics for vulnerable groups,” says Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist with the University of Washington who has studied heat and health for over 30 years. “How does thermoregulation work if you’ve got heart disease?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologists have particular tools that they’re applying for this question,” Ebi continues. “But we do need more answers from other disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Climate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Extreme temperatures already threaten large stretches of the world. Populations across the Middle East, Asia, and sub-­Saharan Africa regularly face highs beyond widely accepted levels of human heat tolerance. Swaths of the southern US, northern Europe, and Asia now also endure unprecedented lows: The 2021 Texas freeze killed at least 246 people, and a 2023 polar vortex sank temperatures in China’s northernmost city to a hypothermic record of –63.4 °F.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This change is here, and more is coming. Climate scientists predict that limiting emissions can prevent lethal extremes from encroaching elsewhere. But if emissions keep course, fierce heat and even cold will reach deeper into every continent. About 2.5 billion people in the world’s hottest places don’t have air-­conditioning. When people do, it can make outdoor temperatures even worse, intensifying the heat island effect in dense cities. And neither AC nor radiators are much help when heat waves and cold snaps capsize the power grid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A thermal image shows a human male holding up peace signs during a test of extreme temperatures." class="wp-image-1125153" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Max.jpg?w=640" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF MAX G.

Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embodied change&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have known for some time that we once braved colder temperatures than anyone previously imagined. Humans pushed into Eurasia and North America well before the last glacial period ended about 11,700 years ago. We were the only hominins to make it out of this era. Neanderthals, Denisovans, and &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; all went extinct. We don’t know for certain what killed those species. But we do know that humans survived thanks to protection from clothing, large social networks, and physiological flexibility. Human resilience to extreme temperature is baked into our bodies, behavior, and genetic code. We wouldn’t be here without it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are constantly in communication with the environment,” says Cara Ocobock, an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame who studies how we expend energy in extreme conditions. She has worked closely with Finnish reindeer herders and Wyoming mountaineers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the relationship between bodies and temperature is surprisingly still a mystery to scientists. In 1847, the anatomist Carl Bergmann observed that animal species grow larger in cold climates. The zoologist Joel Asaph Allen noted in 1877 that cold-dwellers had shorter appendages. Then there’s the nose thing: In the 1920s, the British anthropologist Arthur Thomson theorized that people in cold places have relatively long, narrow noses, the better to heat and humidify the air they take in. These theories stemmed from observations of animals like bears and foxes, and others that followed stemmed from studies comparing the bodies of cold-accustomed Indigenous populations with white male control groups. Some, like those having to do with optimization of surface area, do make sense: It seems reasonable that a tall, thin body increases the amount of skin available to dump excess heat. The problem is, scientists have never actually tested this stuff in humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our bodies are constantly in communication with the environment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Cara Ocobock, anthropologist, University of Notre Dame&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of what we know about temperature tolerance thus far comes from century-old race science or assumptions that anatomy controls everything. But science has evolved. Biology has matured. Childhood experiences, lifestyles, fat cells, and wonky biochemical feedback loops can contribute to a picture of the body as more malleable than anything imagined before. And that’s prompting researchers to change how they study it.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“If you take someone who’s super long and lanky and lean and put them in a cold climate, are they gonna burn more calories to stay warm than somebody who’s short and broad?” Ocobock says. “No one’s looked at that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ocobock and Cowgill teamed up with Scott Maddux and Elizabeth Cho at the Center for Anatomical Sciences at the University of North Texas Health Fort Worth. All four are biological anthropologists who have also puzzled over whether the rules Bergmann, Allen, and Thomson proposed are actually true.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the past four years, the team has been studying how factors like metabolism, fat, sweat, blood flow, and personal history control thermoregulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your native climate, for example, may influence how you handle temperature extremes. In a unique study of mortality statistics from 1980s Milan, Italians raised in warm southern Italy were more likely to survive heat waves in the northern part of the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar trends have appeared in cold climes. Researchers often measure cold tolerance by a person’s “brown adipose,” a type of fat that is specialized for generating heat (unlike white fat, which primarily stores energy). Brown fat is a cold adaptation because it delivers heat without the mechanism of shivering. Studies have linked it to living in cold climates, particularly at young ages. Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt, the physiologist at Maastricht University who with colleagues discovered brown fat in adults, has shown that this tissue can further activate with cold exposure and even help regulate blood sugar and influence how the body burns other fat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That adaptability served as an early clue for the Texas team. They want to know how a person’s response to hot and cold correlates with height, weight, and body shape. What is the difference, Maddux asks, between “a male who’s 6 foot 6 and weighs 240 pounds” and someone else in the same environment “who’s 4 foot 10 and weighs 89 pounds”? But the team also wondered if shape was only part of the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their multi-year experiment uses tools that anthropologists couldn’t have imagined a century ago—devices that track metabolism in real time and analyze genetics. Each participant gets a CT scan (measuring body shape), a DEXA scan (estimating percentages of fat and muscle), high-resolution 3D scans, and DNA analysis from saliva to examine ancestry genetically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Volunteers lie on a cot in underwear, as I did, for about 45 minutes in each climate condition, all on separate days. There’s dry cold, around 40 °F, akin to braving a walk-in refrigerator. Then dry heat and humid heat: 112 °F with 15% humidity and 98&amp;nbsp;°F with 85% humidity. They call it “going to Vegas” and “going to Houston,” says Cowgill. The chamber session is long enough to measure an effect, but short enough to be safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Before I traveled to Texas, Cowgill told me she suspected the old rules would fall. Studies linking temperature tolerance to race and ethnicity, for example, seemed tenuous because biological anthropologists today reject the concept of distinct races. It’s a false premise, she told me: “No one in biological anthropology would argue that human beings do not vary across the globe—that’s obvious to anyone with eyes. [But] you can’t draw sharp borders around populations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She added, “I think there’s a substantial possibility that we spend four years testing this and find out that really, limb length, body mass, surface area […] are not the primary things that are predicting how well you do in cold and heat.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Adaptable to a degree&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July 1995, a week-long heat wave pushed Chicago above 100 °F, killing roughly 500 people. Thirty years later, Ollie Jay, a physiologist at the University of Sydney, can duplicate the conditions of that exceptionally humid heat wave in a climate chamber at his laboratory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can simulate the Chicago heat wave of ’95. The Paris heat wave of 2003. The heat wave [in early July of this year]&amp;nbsp; in Europe,” Jay says. “As long as we’ve got the temperature and humidity information, we can re-create those conditions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everybody has quite an intimate experience of feeling hot, so we’ve got 8 billion experts on how to keep cool,” he says. Yet our internal sense of when heat turns deadly is unreliable. Even professional athletes overseen by experienced medics have died after missing dangerous warning signs. And little research has been done to explore how vulnerable populations such as elderly people, those with heart disease, and low-income communities with limited access to cooling respond to extreme heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jay’s team researches the most effective strategies for surviving it. He lambastes air-conditioning, saying it demands so much energy that it can aggravate climate change in “a vicious cycle.” Instead, he has monitored people’s vital signs while they use fans and skin mists to endure three hours in humid and dry heat. In results published last year, his research found that fans reduced cardiovascular strain by 86% for people with heart disease in the type of humid heat familiar in Chicago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dry heat was a different story. In that simulation, fans not only didn’t help but actually doubled the rate at which core temperatures rose in healthy older people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Heat kills. But not without a fight. Your body must keep its internal temperature in a narrow window flanking 98 °F by less than two degrees. The simple fact that you’re alive means you are &lt;em&gt;producing&lt;/em&gt; heat. Your body needs to export that heat without amassing much more. The nervous system relaxes narrow blood vessels along your skin. Your heart rate increases, propelling more warm blood to your extremities and away from your organs. You sweat. And when that sweat evaporates, it carries a torrent of body heat away with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This thermoregulatory response can be trained. Studies by van Marken Lichtenbelt have shown that exposure to mild heat increases sweat capacity, decreases blood pressure, and drops resting heart rate. Long-term studies based on Finnish saunas suggest similar correlations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The body may adapt protectively to cold, too. In this case, body heat is your lifeline. Shivering and exercise help keep bodies warm. So can clothing. Cardiovascular deaths are thought to spike in cold weather. But people more adapted to cold seem better able to reroute their blood flow in ways that keep their organs warm without dropping their temperature too many degrees in their extremities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the biological anthropologist Stephanie B. Levy (no relation) reported that New Yorkers who experienced lower average temperatures had more productive brown fat, adding evidence for the idea that the inner workings of our bodies adjust to the climate throughout the year and perhaps even throughout our lives. “Do our bodies hold a biological memory of past seasons?” Levy wonders. “That’s still an open question. There’s some work in rodent models to suggest that that’s the case.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although people clearly acclimatize with enough strenuous exposures to either cold or heat, Jay says, “you reach a ceiling.” Consider sweat: Heat exposure can increase the amount you sweat only until your skin is completely saturated. It’s a non­negotiable physical limit. Any additional sweat just means leaking water without carrying away any more heat. “I’ve heard people say we’ll just find a way of evolving out of this—we’ll biologically adapt,” Jay says. “Unless we’re completely changing our body shape, then that’s not going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And body shape may not even sway thermoregulation as much as previously believed. The subject I observed, a personal trainer, appeared outwardly adapted for cold: his broad shoulders didn’t even fit in a single CT scan image. Cowgill supposed that this muscle mass insulated him. When he emerged from his session in the 40 °F environment, though, he had finally started shivering—intensely. The researchers covered him in a heated blanket. He continued shivering. Driving to lunch over an hour later in a hot car, he still mentioned feeling cold. An hour after that, a finger prick drew no blood, a sign that blood vessels in his extremities remained constricted. His body temperature fell about half a degree C in the cold session—a significant drop—and his wider build did not appear to shield him from the cold as well as my involuntary shivering protected me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Cowgill if perhaps there is no such thing as being uniquely predisposed to hot or cold. “Absolutely,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A hot mess&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if body shape doesn’t tell us much about how a person maintains body temperature, and acclimation also runs into limits, then how do we determine how hot is too hot?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2010 two climate change researchers, Steven Sherwood and Matthew Huber, argued that regions around the world become uninhabitable at wet-bulb temperatures of 35 °C, or 95 °F. (Wet-bulb measurements are a way to combine air temperature and relative humidity.) Above 35 °C, a person simply wouldn’t be able to dissipate heat quickly enough. But it turns out that their estimate was too optimistic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers “ran with” that number for a decade, says Daniel Vecellio, a bioclimatologist at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. “But the number had never been actually empirically tested.” In 2021 a Pennsylvania State University physiologist, W. Larry Kenney, worked with Vecellio and others to test wet-bulb limits in a climate chamber. Kenney’s lab investigates which combinations of temperature, humidity, and time push a person’s body over the edge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not long after, the researchers came up with their own wet-bulb limit of human tolerance: below 31 °C in warm, humid conditions for the youngest cohort, people in their thermoregulatory prime. Their research suggests that a day reaching 98 °F and 65% humidity, for example, poses danger in a matter of hours, even for healthy people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125253" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-307.jpg?w=2001" width="2001" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125256" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-433_f18271.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="three medical team members make preparations around a person on a gurney" class="wp-image-1125258" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-359-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Cowgill and her colleagues Elizabeth Cho (top) and Scott Maddux prepare graduate student Joanna Bui for a “room-temperature test.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Vecellio and Huber teamed up, combining the growing arsenal of lab data with state-of-the-art climate simulations to predict where heat and humidity most threatened global populations: first the Middle East and South Asia, then sub-Saharan Africa and eastern China. And assuming that warming reaches 3 to 4 °C over preindustrial levels this century, as predicted, parts of North America, South America, and northern and central Australia will be next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last June, Vecellio, Huber, and Kenney co-published an article revising the limits that Huber had proposed in 2010. “Why not 35 °C?” explained why the human limits have turned out to be lower than expected. Those initial estimates overlooked the fact that our skin temperature can quickly jump above 101 °F in hot weather, for example, making it harder to dump internal heat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Penn State team has published deep dives on how heat tolerance changes with sex and age. Older participants’ wet-bulb limits wound up being even lower—between 27 and 28 °C in warm, humid conditions—and varied more from person to person than they did in young people. “The conditions that we experience now—especially here in North America and Europe, places like that—are well below the limits that we found in our research,” Vecellio says. “We know that heat kills now.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What this fast-growing body of research suggests, Vecellio stresses, is that you can’t define heat risk by just one or two numbers. Last year, he and researchers at Arizona State University pulled up the hottest 10% of hours between 2005 and 2020 for each of 96 US cities. They wanted to compare recent heat-health research with historical weather data for a new perspective: How frequently is it so hot that people’s bodies can’t compensate for it? Over 88% of those “hot hours” met that criterion for people in full sun. In the shade, most of those heat waves became meaningfully less dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s really almost no one who ‘needs’ to die in a heat wave,” says Ebi, the epidemiologist. “We have the tools. We have the understanding. Essentially all [those] deaths are preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More than a number&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A year after visiting Texas, I called Cowgill to hear what she was thinking after four summers of chamber experiments. She told me that the only rule about hot and cold she currently stands behind is … well, none.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She recalled a recent participant—the smallest man in the study, weighing 114 pounds. “He shivered like a leaf on a tree,” Cowgill says. Normally, a strong shiverer warms up quickly. Core temperature may even climb a little. “This [guy] was just shivering and shivering and shivering and not getting any warmer,” she says. She doesn’t know why this happened. “Every time I think I get a picture of what’s going on in there, we’ll have one person come in and just kind of be a complete exception to the rule,” she says, adding that you can’t just gloss over how much human bodies vary inside and out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same messiness complicates physiology studies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jay looks to embrace bodily complexities by improving physiological simulations of heat and the human strain it causes. He’s piloted studies that input a person’s activity level and type of clothing to predict core temperature, dehydration, and cardiovascular strain based on the particular level of heat. One can then estimate the person’s risk on the basis of factors like age and health. He’s also working on physiological models to identify vulnerable groups, inform early-warning systems ahead of heat waves, and possibly advise cities on whether interventions like fans and mists can help protect residents. “Heat is an all-of-­society issue,” Ebi says. Officials could better prepare the public for cold snaps this way too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Death is not the only thing we’re concerned about,” Jay adds.&amp;nbsp; Extreme temperatures bring morbidity and sickness and strain hospital systems: “There’s all these community-level impacts that we’re just completely missing.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate change forces us to reckon with the knotty science of how our bodies interact with the environment. Predicting the health effects is a big and messy matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first wave of answers from Fort Worth will materialize next year. The researchers will analyze thermal images to crunch data on brown fat. They’ll resolve whether, as Cowgill suspects, your body shape may not sway temperature tolerance as much as previously assumed. “Human variation is the rule,” she says, “not the exception.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max G.

Libby Cowgill, an anthropologist in a furry parka, has wheeled me and my cot into a metal-walled room set to 40 °F. A loud fan pummels me from above and siphons the dregs of my body heat through the cot’s mesh from below. A large respirator fits snug over my nose and mouth. The device tracks carbon dioxide in my exhales—a proxy for how my metabolism speeds up or slows down throughout the experiment. Eventually Cowgill will remove my respirator to slip a wire-thin metal temperature probe several pointy inches into my nose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cowgill and a graduate student quietly observe me from the corner of their so-called “climate chamber.&lt;sup&gt;”&lt;/sup&gt; Just a few hours earlier I’d sat beside them to observe as another volunteer, a 24-year-old personal trainer, endured the cold. Every few minutes, they measured his skin temperature with a thermal camera, his core temperature with a wireless pill, and his blood pressure and other metrics that hinted at how his body handles extreme cold. He lasted almost an hour without shivering; when my turn comes, I shiver aggressively on the cot for nearly an hour straight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m visiting Texas to learn about this experiment on how different bodies respond to extreme climates. “What’s the record for fastest to shiver so far?” I jokingly ask Cowgill as she tapes biosensing devices to my chest and legs. After I exit the cold, she surprises me: “You, believe it or not, were not the worst person we’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change forces us to reckon with the knotty science of how our bodies interact with the environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cowgill is a 40-something anthropologist at the University of Missouri who powerlifts and teaches CrossFit in her spare time. She’s small and strong, with dark bangs and geometric tattoos. Since 2022, she’s spent the summers at the University of North Texas Health Science Center tending to these uncomfortable experiments. Her team hopes to revamp the science of thermoregulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;While we know in broad strokes how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. “We have the general picture. We don’t have a lot of the specifics for vulnerable groups,” says Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist with the University of Washington who has studied heat and health for over 30 years. “How does thermoregulation work if you’ve got heart disease?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologists have particular tools that they’re applying for this question,” Ebi continues. “But we do need more answers from other disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Climate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Extreme temperatures already threaten large stretches of the world. Populations across the Middle East, Asia, and sub-­Saharan Africa regularly face highs beyond widely accepted levels of human heat tolerance. Swaths of the southern US, northern Europe, and Asia now also endure unprecedented lows: The 2021 Texas freeze killed at least 246 people, and a 2023 polar vortex sank temperatures in China’s northernmost city to a hypothermic record of –63.4 °F.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This change is here, and more is coming. Climate scientists predict that limiting emissions can prevent lethal extremes from encroaching elsewhere. But if emissions keep course, fierce heat and even cold will reach deeper into every continent. About 2.5 billion people in the world’s hottest places don’t have air-­conditioning. When people do, it can make outdoor temperatures even worse, intensifying the heat island effect in dense cities. And neither AC nor radiators are much help when heat waves and cold snaps capsize the power grid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A thermal image shows a human male holding up peace signs during a test of extreme temperatures." class="wp-image-1125153" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Max.jpg?w=640" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;COURTESY OF MAX G.

Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Embodied change&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have known for some time that we once braved colder temperatures than anyone previously imagined. Humans pushed into Eurasia and North America well before the last glacial period ended about 11,700 years ago. We were the only hominins to make it out of this era. Neanderthals, Denisovans, and &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; all went extinct. We don’t know for certain what killed those species. But we do know that humans survived thanks to protection from clothing, large social networks, and physiological flexibility. Human resilience to extreme temperature is baked into our bodies, behavior, and genetic code. We wouldn’t be here without it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are constantly in communication with the environment,” says Cara Ocobock, an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame who studies how we expend energy in extreme conditions. She has worked closely with Finnish reindeer herders and Wyoming mountaineers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the relationship between bodies and temperature is surprisingly still a mystery to scientists. In 1847, the anatomist Carl Bergmann observed that animal species grow larger in cold climates. The zoologist Joel Asaph Allen noted in 1877 that cold-dwellers had shorter appendages. Then there’s the nose thing: In the 1920s, the British anthropologist Arthur Thomson theorized that people in cold places have relatively long, narrow noses, the better to heat and humidify the air they take in. These theories stemmed from observations of animals like bears and foxes, and others that followed stemmed from studies comparing the bodies of cold-accustomed Indigenous populations with white male control groups. Some, like those having to do with optimization of surface area, do make sense: It seems reasonable that a tall, thin body increases the amount of skin available to dump excess heat. The problem is, scientists have never actually tested this stuff in humans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our bodies are constantly in communication with the environment.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Cara Ocobock, anthropologist, University of Notre Dame&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of what we know about temperature tolerance thus far comes from century-old race science or assumptions that anatomy controls everything. But science has evolved. Biology has matured. Childhood experiences, lifestyles, fat cells, and wonky biochemical feedback loops can contribute to a picture of the body as more malleable than anything imagined before. And that’s prompting researchers to change how they study it.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“If you take someone who’s super long and lanky and lean and put them in a cold climate, are they gonna burn more calories to stay warm than somebody who’s short and broad?” Ocobock says. “No one’s looked at that.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ocobock and Cowgill teamed up with Scott Maddux and Elizabeth Cho at the Center for Anatomical Sciences at the University of North Texas Health Fort Worth. All four are biological anthropologists who have also puzzled over whether the rules Bergmann, Allen, and Thomson proposed are actually true.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the past four years, the team has been studying how factors like metabolism, fat, sweat, blood flow, and personal history control thermoregulation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your native climate, for example, may influence how you handle temperature extremes. In a unique study of mortality statistics from 1980s Milan, Italians raised in warm southern Italy were more likely to survive heat waves in the northern part of the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar trends have appeared in cold climes. Researchers often measure cold tolerance by a person’s “brown adipose,” a type of fat that is specialized for generating heat (unlike white fat, which primarily stores energy). Brown fat is a cold adaptation because it delivers heat without the mechanism of shivering. Studies have linked it to living in cold climates, particularly at young ages. Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt, the physiologist at Maastricht University who with colleagues discovered brown fat in adults, has shown that this tissue can further activate with cold exposure and even help regulate blood sugar and influence how the body burns other fat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That adaptability served as an early clue for the Texas team. They want to know how a person’s response to hot and cold correlates with height, weight, and body shape. What is the difference, Maddux asks, between “a male who’s 6 foot 6 and weighs 240 pounds” and someone else in the same environment “who’s 4 foot 10 and weighs 89 pounds”? But the team also wondered if shape was only part of the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their multi-year experiment uses tools that anthropologists couldn’t have imagined a century ago—devices that track metabolism in real time and analyze genetics. Each participant gets a CT scan (measuring body shape), a DEXA scan (estimating percentages of fat and muscle), high-resolution 3D scans, and DNA analysis from saliva to examine ancestry genetically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Volunteers lie on a cot in underwear, as I did, for about 45 minutes in each climate condition, all on separate days. There’s dry cold, around 40 °F, akin to braving a walk-in refrigerator. Then dry heat and humid heat: 112 °F with 15% humidity and 98&amp;nbsp;°F with 85% humidity. They call it “going to Vegas” and “going to Houston,” says Cowgill. The chamber session is long enough to measure an effect, but short enough to be safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Before I traveled to Texas, Cowgill told me she suspected the old rules would fall. Studies linking temperature tolerance to race and ethnicity, for example, seemed tenuous because biological anthropologists today reject the concept of distinct races. It’s a false premise, she told me: “No one in biological anthropology would argue that human beings do not vary across the globe—that’s obvious to anyone with eyes. [But] you can’t draw sharp borders around populations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She added, “I think there’s a substantial possibility that we spend four years testing this and find out that really, limb length, body mass, surface area […] are not the primary things that are predicting how well you do in cold and heat.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Adaptable to a degree&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In July 1995, a week-long heat wave pushed Chicago above 100 °F, killing roughly 500 people. Thirty years later, Ollie Jay, a physiologist at the University of Sydney, can duplicate the conditions of that exceptionally humid heat wave in a climate chamber at his laboratory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We can simulate the Chicago heat wave of ’95. The Paris heat wave of 2003. The heat wave [in early July of this year]&amp;nbsp; in Europe,” Jay says. “As long as we’ve got the temperature and humidity information, we can re-create those conditions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everybody has quite an intimate experience of feeling hot, so we’ve got 8 billion experts on how to keep cool,” he says. Yet our internal sense of when heat turns deadly is unreliable. Even professional athletes overseen by experienced medics have died after missing dangerous warning signs. And little research has been done to explore how vulnerable populations such as elderly people, those with heart disease, and low-income communities with limited access to cooling respond to extreme heat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jay’s team researches the most effective strategies for surviving it. He lambastes air-conditioning, saying it demands so much energy that it can aggravate climate change in “a vicious cycle.” Instead, he has monitored people’s vital signs while they use fans and skin mists to endure three hours in humid and dry heat. In results published last year, his research found that fans reduced cardiovascular strain by 86% for people with heart disease in the type of humid heat familiar in Chicago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dry heat was a different story. In that simulation, fans not only didn’t help but actually doubled the rate at which core temperatures rose in healthy older people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Heat kills. But not without a fight. Your body must keep its internal temperature in a narrow window flanking 98 °F by less than two degrees. The simple fact that you’re alive means you are &lt;em&gt;producing&lt;/em&gt; heat. Your body needs to export that heat without amassing much more. The nervous system relaxes narrow blood vessels along your skin. Your heart rate increases, propelling more warm blood to your extremities and away from your organs. You sweat. And when that sweat evaporates, it carries a torrent of body heat away with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This thermoregulatory response can be trained. Studies by van Marken Lichtenbelt have shown that exposure to mild heat increases sweat capacity, decreases blood pressure, and drops resting heart rate. Long-term studies based on Finnish saunas suggest similar correlations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The body may adapt protectively to cold, too. In this case, body heat is your lifeline. Shivering and exercise help keep bodies warm. So can clothing. Cardiovascular deaths are thought to spike in cold weather. But people more adapted to cold seem better able to reroute their blood flow in ways that keep their organs warm without dropping their temperature too many degrees in their extremities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the biological anthropologist Stephanie B. Levy (no relation) reported that New Yorkers who experienced lower average temperatures had more productive brown fat, adding evidence for the idea that the inner workings of our bodies adjust to the climate throughout the year and perhaps even throughout our lives. “Do our bodies hold a biological memory of past seasons?” Levy wonders. “That’s still an open question. There’s some work in rodent models to suggest that that’s the case.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although people clearly acclimatize with enough strenuous exposures to either cold or heat, Jay says, “you reach a ceiling.” Consider sweat: Heat exposure can increase the amount you sweat only until your skin is completely saturated. It’s a non­negotiable physical limit. Any additional sweat just means leaking water without carrying away any more heat. “I’ve heard people say we’ll just find a way of evolving out of this—we’ll biologically adapt,” Jay says. “Unless we’re completely changing our body shape, then that’s not going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;And body shape may not even sway thermoregulation as much as previously believed. The subject I observed, a personal trainer, appeared outwardly adapted for cold: his broad shoulders didn’t even fit in a single CT scan image. Cowgill supposed that this muscle mass insulated him. When he emerged from his session in the 40 °F environment, though, he had finally started shivering—intensely. The researchers covered him in a heated blanket. He continued shivering. Driving to lunch over an hour later in a hot car, he still mentioned feeling cold. An hour after that, a finger prick drew no blood, a sign that blood vessels in his extremities remained constricted. His body temperature fell about half a degree C in the cold session—a significant drop—and his wider build did not appear to shield him from the cold as well as my involuntary shivering protected me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Cowgill if perhaps there is no such thing as being uniquely predisposed to hot or cold. “Absolutely,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A hot mess&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if body shape doesn’t tell us much about how a person maintains body temperature, and acclimation also runs into limits, then how do we determine how hot is too hot?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 2010 two climate change researchers, Steven Sherwood and Matthew Huber, argued that regions around the world become uninhabitable at wet-bulb temperatures of 35 °C, or 95 °F. (Wet-bulb measurements are a way to combine air temperature and relative humidity.) Above 35 °C, a person simply wouldn’t be able to dissipate heat quickly enough. But it turns out that their estimate was too optimistic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers “ran with” that number for a decade, says Daniel Vecellio, a bioclimatologist at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. “But the number had never been actually empirically tested.” In 2021 a Pennsylvania State University physiologist, W. Larry Kenney, worked with Vecellio and others to test wet-bulb limits in a climate chamber. Kenney’s lab investigates which combinations of temperature, humidity, and time push a person’s body over the edge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not long after, the researchers came up with their own wet-bulb limit of human tolerance: below 31 °C in warm, humid conditions for the youngest cohort, people in their thermoregulatory prime. Their research suggests that a day reaching 98 °F and 65% humidity, for example, poses danger in a matter of hours, even for healthy people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125253" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-307.jpg?w=2001" width="2001" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="imageSet__wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__wrapper--07c4096a3b25e22dc82ee78b6368d947"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1125256" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-433_f18271.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;div class="columns__content--3becc448c76a1a5a553df1358f1eebf3"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="three medical team members make preparations around a person on a gurney" class="wp-image-1125258" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clemons-MIT-8-25-359-edited.jpg" /&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;JUSTIN CLEMONS&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt; &lt;p class="imageSet__caption"&gt;Cowgill and her colleagues Elizabeth Cho (top) and Scott Maddux prepare graduate student Joanna Bui for a “room-temperature test.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Vecellio and Huber teamed up, combining the growing arsenal of lab data with state-of-the-art climate simulations to predict where heat and humidity most threatened global populations: first the Middle East and South Asia, then sub-Saharan Africa and eastern China. And assuming that warming reaches 3 to 4 °C over preindustrial levels this century, as predicted, parts of North America, South America, and northern and central Australia will be next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last June, Vecellio, Huber, and Kenney co-published an article revising the limits that Huber had proposed in 2010. “Why not 35 °C?” explained why the human limits have turned out to be lower than expected. Those initial estimates overlooked the fact that our skin temperature can quickly jump above 101 °F in hot weather, for example, making it harder to dump internal heat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Penn State team has published deep dives on how heat tolerance changes with sex and age. Older participants’ wet-bulb limits wound up being even lower—between 27 and 28 °C in warm, humid conditions—and varied more from person to person than they did in young people. “The conditions that we experience now—especially here in North America and Europe, places like that—are well below the limits that we found in our research,” Vecellio says. “We know that heat kills now.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What this fast-growing body of research suggests, Vecellio stresses, is that you can’t define heat risk by just one or two numbers. Last year, he and researchers at Arizona State University pulled up the hottest 10% of hours between 2005 and 2020 for each of 96 US cities. They wanted to compare recent heat-health research with historical weather data for a new perspective: How frequently is it so hot that people’s bodies can’t compensate for it? Over 88% of those “hot hours” met that criterion for people in full sun. In the shade, most of those heat waves became meaningfully less dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s really almost no one who ‘needs’ to die in a heat wave,” says Ebi, the epidemiologist. “We have the tools. We have the understanding. Essentially all [those] deaths are preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More than a number&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A year after visiting Texas, I called Cowgill to hear what she was thinking after four summers of chamber experiments. She told me that the only rule about hot and cold she currently stands behind is … well, none.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She recalled a recent participant—the smallest man in the study, weighing 114 pounds. “He shivered like a leaf on a tree,” Cowgill says. Normally, a strong shiverer warms up quickly. Core temperature may even climb a little. “This [guy] was just shivering and shivering and shivering and not getting any warmer,” she says. She doesn’t know why this happened. “Every time I think I get a picture of what’s going on in there, we’ll have one person come in and just kind of be a complete exception to the rule,” she says, adding that you can’t just gloss over how much human bodies vary inside and out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same messiness complicates physiology studies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jay looks to embrace bodily complexities by improving physiological simulations of heat and the human strain it causes. He’s piloted studies that input a person’s activity level and type of clothing to predict core temperature, dehydration, and cardiovascular strain based on the particular level of heat. One can then estimate the person’s risk on the basis of factors like age and health. He’s also working on physiological models to identify vulnerable groups, inform early-warning systems ahead of heat waves, and possibly advise cities on whether interventions like fans and mists can help protect residents. “Heat is an all-of-­society issue,” Ebi says. Officials could better prepare the public for cold snaps this way too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Death is not the only thing we’re concerned about,” Jay adds.&amp;nbsp; Extreme temperatures bring morbidity and sickness and strain hospital systems: “There’s all these community-level impacts that we’re just completely missing.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate change forces us to reckon with the knotty science of how our bodies interact with the environment. Predicting the health effects is a big and messy matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first wave of answers from Fort Worth will materialize next year.

   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025 climate tech companies to watch: Kairos Power and its next-generation nuclear reactors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Like many new nuclear startups, Kairos promises a path to reliable, 24/7 decarbonized power. Unlike most, it already has prototypes under construction and permits for several reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company uses molten salt to cool its reactions and transfer heat, rather than the high-pressure water that’s used in existing fission reactors. It hopes its technology will enable commercial reactors that are cost-competitive with natural gas plants and boast safer operation than conventional reactors, even in the event of complete power loss. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Mark Harris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kairos Power is one of our 10 climate tech companies to watch—our annual list of some of the most promising climate tech firms on the planet. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the rest of the list here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Narrated: Inside the strange limbo facing millions of IVF embryos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Millions of embryos created through IVF sit frozen in time, stored in tanks around the world. The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. While these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them. What do these embryos mean to us? Who should be responsible for them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is American psychologist B.F. Skinner’s research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI.

It hopes its technology will enable commercial reactors that are cost-competitive with natural gas plants and boast safer operation than conventional reactors, even in the event of complete power loss. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Mark Harris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kairos Power is one of our 10 climate tech companies to watch—our annual list of some of the most promising climate tech firms on the planet. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the rest of the list here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Narrated: Inside the strange limbo facing millions of IVF embryos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Millions of embryos created through IVF sit frozen in time, stored in tanks around the world. The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. While these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them. What do these embryos mean to us? Who should be responsible for them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

But an equally important, if surprising and less appreciated, forerunner is American psychologist B.F. Skinner’s research with pigeons in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skinner believed that association—learning, through trial and error, to link an action with a punishment or reward—was the building block of every behavior, not just in pigeons but in all living organisms, including human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His “behaviorist” theories fell out of favor with psychologists and animal researchers in the 1960s but were taken up by computer scientists who eventually provided the foundation for many of the artificial-intelligence tools from leading firms like Google and OpenAI.
