The company may pay Google about $1 billion each year for access to technology that can create summaries and handle planning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple will run the custom model on its Private Cloud Compute servers, while still relying on its own systems for some parts of Siri. Gurman reports that the Gemini model uses 1.2 trillion parameters, far more than the 150 billion parameters behind the current cloud-based version of Apple Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is preparing to spend about $1 billion each year on a powerful Google-built artificial intelligence model with 1.2 trillion parameters, according to people familiar with the matter, as reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The system is expected to play a central role in a major update to Siri, a project the company has been working toward for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of testing, Apple and Google are close to a deal that would give Apple access to the technology. The people discussing the plans asked not to be named because the talks are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is turning to Google to help rebuild Siri’s core technology, laying the groundwork for a broad refresh of features planned for next year. The size of Google’s model would far exceed the AI systems Apple uses today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple tested other outside options — including Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Anthropic’s Claude — before deciding to move forward with Google earlier this year. The goal is to rely on Gemini as a temporary solution until Apple’s own work reaches the same level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Siri is planned for release next spring, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. Because months remain before launch, parts of the plan could still change. Apple and Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of both companies briefly rose after the news surfaced Wednesday. Apple’s stock gained less than 1% to $271.70, while Alphabet climbed as much as 3.2% to $286.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The custom Gemini model would be a major jump from the 150 billion parameter system Apple currently uses in the cloud for Apple Intelligence. The move is meant to increase Siri’s ability to process complex tasks and understand context at a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is known internally as Glenwood and is led by Vision Pro headset creator Mike Rockwell and software chief Craig Federighi. The refreshed voice assistant, set to appear in iOS 26.4, is code-named Linwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Google’s model will support Siri’s summarizer and planner features — the parts that help the assistant understand information and decide on action steps. Apple’s own models will still handle some tools and responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model will run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, keeping user data isolated from Google’s systems. Apple already set aside server hardware for the effort to support Siri’s new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the partnership is large, Apple is not expected to promote it to consumers. Google will act as a quiet technology provider, unlike the visible search agreement inside Safari. Siri’s improvements will likely appear without Google branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal is separate from earlier talks about placing Gemini directly inside Siri as a chatbot. Those conversations nearly turned into a product in both 2024 and again earlier this year, but never moved forward. The new agreement also does not place Google AI search features inside Apple’s operating systems, leaving Siri’s search behavior unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Apple’s most recent earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Siri may add more chatbot options in the future, beyond the current ChatGPT choice. Apple continues to look for ways to expand Siri without relying on one provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies are also adopting Gemini. Snap and several major firms are building products using Google’s Vertex AI platform. For Apple, the move reflects how far behind it has fallen in AI — and how willing the company is to use outside tools to improve Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Apple does not plan to use Gemini forever. The company has lost AI engineers in recent years, including the head of its models team, but Apple’s leadership still wants to develop its own technology and eventually replace Google’s system inside Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple’s internal team is building its own cloud-based model with up to 1 trillion parameters, which could be ready for consumer use as early as next year. That work is expected to support Siri’s growth in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives believe they can match Google’s quality over time. But Google continues to improve Gemini, making the gap harder to close. Its 2.5 Pro version ranks near the top of most large language model comparisons, which affects how Apple plans Siri’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple also wants to bring Apple Intelligence and the updated Siri to China. Because Google services are banned in the country, the system used there will not rely on Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Apple plans to use its own models along with a content filter built by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. That tool would adjust responses to meet government requirements. Apple has also explored a partnership with Baidu Inc. for AI features in the Chinese market, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by omid armin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Inside Tim Cook’s push to get Apple back in the AI race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-110383" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Look at the big picture instead. (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/06/1127579/ai-footprint/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mit_ai_papercut-final.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picture it: I’m minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). A friend of a friend wanders up, and we strike up a conversation. It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I’m a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: “Should I be using AI? I’ve heard it’s awful for the environment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This actually happens pretty often now. Generally, I tell people not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That response might surprise some people, but I promise I’m not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. (That’s roughly as much as Japan.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: “What should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;That one gets under my skin because of the context: BP helped popularize the concept of a carbon footprint in a marketing campaign in the early 2000s. That framing effectively shifts the burden of worrying about the environment from fossil-fuel companies to individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. We need companies to innovate and take decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Focusing too much on individuals is a distraction from the real solutions on the table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see something similar today with AI. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. A couple of recent reports put the electricity used to query a chatbot at about 0.3 watt-hours, the same as powering a microwave for about a second. That’s so small as to be virtually insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power—about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.&amp;nbsp; (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasingly, there’s no getting away from AI, and it’s not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider’s suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you’re shopping online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that’s changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there’s absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as long as you aren’t relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn’t be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power—about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.&amp;nbsp; (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasingly, there’s no getting away from AI, and it’s not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider’s suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you’re shopping online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that’s changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say there’s absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as long as you aren’t relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn’t be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

As part of the deal, Perplexity will pay Snap $400 million in cash and equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal gives Perplexity exposure to more than 940 million Snapchat users, who will get answers from its AI engine when they ask questions to the company’s My AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new feature will be integrated into the app’s interface early next year. Snap said it will start recording revenue from this deal from 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal was announced alongside Snap’s Q3 2025 results. The company reported revenue of $1.51 billion, up 10% from a year earlier, though it narrowed its loss to $104 million from $153 million a year ago. The company said its subscription tier, Snapchat+, now has more than 17 million users.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Snap-Inc-Perplexity-White-16x9-1.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Snap said on Thursday that it has signed a deal to integrate Perplexity’s AI search engine directly within Snapchat.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI integration, launched in the U.S. on Wednesday, brings hands-free AI assistance to Maps, as well as contextual suggestions while navigating and information about places of interest. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Miriam Daniel, vice president and head of Google Maps, said the rollout required significant localization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When we say localizing for India, it’s not just the language,” she said at a virtual briefing. “It’s also adapting to how Indians use the product, how Indians will talk, how they will ask for questions, how they will identify places, the geopolitical places, the street names, you know, everything is sort of different in India.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gemini in Maps will be available to all Android and iOS users in India in the coming weeks, Google said. At launch, Gemini will support nine Indian languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also adding a set of India-specific navigation and commuting updates. Drivers will now get visual and audio alerts when they’re passing accident-prone stretches. Google said it is working on these alerts with local authorities, and the feature will roll out to Android users in Gurugram, the Cyberabad region of Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Faridabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3065586" height="1400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-maps-accident-prone-alerts.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google has come under scrutiny in India over the reliability of some navigation routes, after a car drove off an unfinished bridge in Uttar Pradesh, killing three men, late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The real world conditions can keep changing, and it’s very dynamic, and sometimes it changes in an instant. Maps can’t be accurate 100% of the time,” said Anal Ghosh, senior program manager for Google Maps, when asked about warnings for incomplete roads or unfinished bridges. “So we would encourage users to ensure that they’re keeping their eyes on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google said it has partnered with the country’s highways regulator, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to receive near real-time data on road closures, diversions and repair work. The company said the partnership will also allow Maps to show wayside amenities such as public restrooms, restaurants and fuel stations along national highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other new features include proactive notifications about major disruptions or delays on routes, even when users are not navigating. These alerts are rolling out to Android users for highways and major roads in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app will also display speed limits during navigation, using data from local traffic authorities. This feature is rolling out to Android and iOS users in nine cities: Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Hyderabad (including the Cyberabad region), Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Noida.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building on the flyover navigation feature launched last year, Maps is now getting voice support for flyovers.
