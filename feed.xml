The group launched in September with more than $1 billion in commitments, timing that aligns with India’s new ₹1 trillion (around $12 billion) research and development initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;NVIDIA has joined the coalition as a strategic technical advisor, without any financial commitments, while Qualcomm Ventures has come on board alongside six Indian venture firms, bringing additional capital commitments totaling more than $850 million.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India is home to more than 180,000 startups and over 120 unicorns. In its early years, much of the ecosystem closely mirrored Western business models before evolving into SaaS companies that serve global clients, especially those in the U.S. In recent years, however, India’s focus has shifted to building ventures that tackle harder, infrastructure-scale problems — from launching satellites and electrifying transportation to designing semiconductors. The Indian government has sought to accelerate this shift as major economies race to secure technological sovereignty. Yet capital for such ventures remains scarce, as they require a longer gestation period than traditional sectors and most VCs favor proven, lower-risk models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In September, Silicon Valley- and India-based Celesta Capital spearheaded the launch of the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA) to bridge that gap, bringing together seven major U.S. and Indian investors — Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, Gaja Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Tenacity Ventures, and Venture Catalysts. The latest addition includes Indian venture firms Activate AI, Chiratae Ventures, InfoEdge Ventures, Kalaari Capital, Singularity Holdings, and YourNest Venture Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The coalition aims to invest capital and provide mentorship and network access to Indian deep-tech startups over the next five to ten years. It also plans to collaborate with the Indian government on its policy initiatives, including the recently introduced Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a coalition of the willing, wanting to support the development of the Indian deep tech ecosystem,” Sriram Viswanathan, founding managing partner of Celesta Capital and founding executive council member of the IDTA, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Approved by the Indian cabinet earlier this year and rolled out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, the ₹1 trillion RDI scheme will fund projects in areas such as energy security and transition, quantum computing, robotics, space tech, biotech, and AI through long-term loans, equity infusions, and allocations to deep-tech funds of funds. The venture firms participating in the alliance plan to leverage the initiative to back Indian-domiciled deep-tech startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is, in a way, the most seminal moment where the Indian government’s action will drive creation and the formation of many of these deep tech companies and will be supported by a number of VCs in India that are really looking at developing this ecosystem,” Viswanathan told TechCrunch. “There is a turning point in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem in favor of deep tech, and that’s what we’re all excited about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3065055" height="1099" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/india-deep-tech-alliance.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;IDTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance has brought in NVIDIA to provide strategic and technical guidance to its members and emerging startups. The U.S. chipmaker — whose market value has surged amid the global boom in AI — will advise on best practices for integrating NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing platforms, offer technical talks and training through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, and contribute to policy dialogues between industry and the government to advance India’s deep-tech capabilities, the alliance said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although NVIDIA will not participate financially, Vishal Dhupar, NVIDIA’s managing director for South Asia, said the company will share technical insights and scalable computing resources with Indian startups in the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“NVIDIA’s support is a pretty significant validation of the ecosystem, and them joining the IDTA is an endorsement of our collective objective that there is an opportunity for India to start seeing a burgeoning growth of this ecosystem,” Viswanathan told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike NVIDIA, Qualcomm is joining the alliance with an investment focus. The San Diego–based chipmaker made its first India investment in 2008, with early bets including Google Maps rival MapmyIndia, which went public in late 2021. Qualcomm and Celesta also backed Indian drone maker IdeaForge, which has been a publicly listed company since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Qualcomm’s participation will extend beyond capital, said Rama Bethmangalkar, India managing director at Qualcomm Ventures. The firm plans to help startups connect with its portfolio companies, partner networks, and internal teams within Qualcomm, he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you are like minded and other VCs have allocated certain portion of their resources, dollars, time, and network, it helps each other and then collectively to work with the government, to be aligned with what the government is thinking on certain areas, whether it is quantum, semiconductors, AI, or emerging technologies, it is very important to be part of that group,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That said, the success of the IDTA remains to be seen. Viswanathan described the alliance as a “loose coalition of the willing,” noting that participating investors continue to run their own programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re collaborating to share knowledge, to share deal flow, and all of that,” he said when asked about the progress since the alliance’s launch in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It is also unclear how much of the capital each participant will contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re just collectively estimating what the total commitment is to this ecosystem,” Viswanathan said. “This alliance is not a fund. There’s no obligation, no allocation, if you will, of any deal. If Rama finds a deal, he will do it. If Rama finds it appropriate to bring in other investors, he’ll share the deal with other investors that he thinks are relevant for that investment.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;India’s deep-tech funding rose 78% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in 2024, according to a report by IT industry body Nasscom and global consulting firm Zinnov released in April. While the growth is promising, the capital raised still trails far behind that in developed markets, especially the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The alliance may help increase that figure, but more importantly, it is expected to draw global attention — and, in turn, more investors and corporate venture funds — to India’s startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What we need are role models to begin with,” said Bethmangalkar. “People are going to jump in. Entrepreneurs are going to get the confidence capital… In ten years, you’ll start seeing these as the companies listed on the main boards of our exchanges — deeply science- and tech-oriented firms.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;NVIDIA and Qualcomm Ventures have joined a growing coalition of U.S. and Indian investors backing India’s deep tech startups.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;All told, $100 million in shares just traded hands, split roughly 60% primary and 40% secondary, as part of MoEngage’s Series F round. The funding marks the entry of Indian venture firm A91 Partners as a new investor co-leading the round with Goldman Sachs Alternatives. According to MoEngage, it has now raised $250 million in funding altogether.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As consumer brands increasingly rely on digital channels to reach customers, competition for attention has intensified. That’s pushed companies to use the customer data they already have to deliver more personalized marketing. While established marketing platforms continue to serve this space, brands are now seeking AI-driven tools that can automate decision-making and reduce manual labor. MoEngage positions itself in this segment with its Merlin AI suite, which helps marketing and product teams launch campaigns faster and improve targeting efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We help B2C brands engage more effectively with their customers by leveraging the first-party data they already have,” Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and CEO of MoEngage, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 11-year-old startup spent its first seven years focusing largely on India and Southeast Asia. Over the past four years, it has expanded its reach to new markets, particularly North America, which now contributes more than 30% of its revenue, Dodda told TechCrunch. About 25% of the business comes from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Goldman Sachs’ backing in the latest funding will help further bolster MoEngage’s global presence. The investment bank also co-led the startup’s Series E round of $77 million along with B Capital in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The current investors know the most about the company, in terms of how the company performs, and they know everything good and bad,” said Dodda. “[Goldman Sachs] leading the round is a strong validation of our fundamentals.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Over the past two to three years, MoEngage has invested heavily in generative AI and decisioning AI capabilities. These efforts are reflected in its Merlin AI suite, which Dodda said includes a range of AI agents built for marketing use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these agents act like copywriters, helping consumer brands draft marketing messages, create multiple variants of a campaign, or generate text in natural language along with relevant images. The suite also includes decisioning AI tools that help brands determine which customers should receive a particular message or offer, on which channel, and at what time, Dodda said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064885" height="1177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/moengage-merlin-ai.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;MoEngage’s Merlin AI suite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoEngage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage currently serves over 1,350 consumer brands worldwide, including SoundCloud, McAfee, Kayak, Domino’s, Deutsche Telekom, and Travelodge, as well as prominent Indian household names such as Swiggy, Flipkart, Ola, Airtel, and Tata. About 60% of the company’s business comes from traditional enterprises, while the remaining 40% is from internet-focused firms. The platform also works with more than 25 global banks and several large insurers, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and India’s largest insurer, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these brands previously used marketing platforms from incumbents such as Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce. MoEngage has since won over more than 300 of them, helping drive growth in North America and the EMEA regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one instance, SoundCloud migrated over 120 million users to MoEngage within 12 weeks, utilizing AI-driven insights to accelerate product launches and enhance retention among its paid users, said Hope Barrett, senior director of martech at SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several of MoEngage’s customers also relied on multiple point solutions to handle specific tasks. The company helped consolidate those tools into a unified platform to cut costs and streamline marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you look at all of our brands, whether it’s a bank or an e-commerce company, they leverage MoEngage to unify all their customer data from all the touchpoints. It could be their offline stores, website, mobile app [or other channels],” Dodda told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Without disclosing exact figures, Dodda said MoEngage grew about 40% year-over-year last year and aims to maintain a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three years. The company also expects to become adjusted EBITDA-positive on a quarterly basis by the end of the current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage sees companies such as Braze and CleverTap, as well as legacy marketing clouds by Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce, among its key competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has about 800 employees across its 15 offices worldwide. It plans to expand its workforce, particularly in North America and Europe, by scaling its customer success, support, sales, and marketing teams to deepen its presence in those markets. MoEngage also intends to build additional AI capabilities and hire more talent to support that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage plans to become IPO-ready within the next couple of years, Dodda told TechCrunch, without sharing a specific timeline for going public.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We see an opportunity to build a multi-billion dollar revenue company in our space,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;MoEngage, a customer engagement platform that works with consumer brands across 75 countries, says it has raised new funding led by its existing investor, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, to ramp up global growth and infuse more AI into its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064885" height="1177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/moengage-merlin-ai.jpg" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;MoEngage’s Merlin AI suite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;MoEngage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage currently serves over 1,350 consumer brands worldwide, including SoundCloud, McAfee, Kayak, Domino’s, Deutsche Telekom, and Travelodge, as well as prominent Indian household names such as Swiggy, Flipkart, Ola, Airtel, and Tata. About 60% of the company’s business comes from traditional enterprises, while the remaining 40% is from internet-focused firms. The platform also works with more than 25 global banks and several large insurers, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and India’s largest insurer, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of these brands previously used marketing platforms from incumbents such as Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce. MoEngage has since won over more than 300 of them, helping drive growth in North America and the EMEA regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In one instance, SoundCloud migrated over 120 million users to MoEngage within 12 weeks, utilizing AI-driven insights to accelerate product launches and enhance retention among its paid users, said Hope Barrett, senior director of martech at SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several of MoEngage’s customers also relied on multiple point solutions to handle specific tasks. The company helped consolidate those tools into a unified platform to cut costs and streamline marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you look at all of our brands, whether it’s a bank or an e-commerce company, they leverage MoEngage to unify all their customer data from all the touchpoints. It could be their offline stores, website, mobile app [or other channels],” Dodda told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Without disclosing exact figures, Dodda said MoEngage grew about 40% year-over-year last year and aims to maintain a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three years. The company also expects to become adjusted EBITDA-positive on a quarterly basis by the end of the current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage sees companies such as Braze and CleverTap, as well as legacy marketing clouds by Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce, among its key competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup has about 800 employees across its 15 offices worldwide. It plans to expand its workforce, particularly in North America and Europe, by scaling its customer success, support, sales, and marketing teams to deepen its presence in those markets. MoEngage also intends to build additional AI capabilities and hire more talent to support that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MoEngage plans to become IPO-ready within the next couple of years, Dodda told TechCrunch, without sharing a specific timeline for going public.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We see an opportunity to build a multi-billion dollar revenue company in our space,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/goldman-sachs-doubles-down-on-moengage-in-100m-round-to-fuel-global-expansion/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:20:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] From vibe coding to context engineering: 2025 in software development (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/05/1127477/from-vibe-coding-to-context-engineering-2025-in-software-development/</link><description>&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provided by&lt;/span&gt;Thoughtworks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, we’ve seen a real-time experiment playing out across the technology industry, one in which AI’s software engineering capabilities have been put to the test against human technologists. And although 2025 may have started with AI looking strong, the transition from vibe coding to what’s being termed context engineering shows that while the work of human developers is evolving, they nevertheless remain absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is captured in the latest volume of the “Thoughtworks Technology Radar,” a report on the technologies used by our teams on projects with clients. In it, we see the emergence of techniques and tooling designed to help teams better tackle the problem of managing context when working with LLMs and AI agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taken together, there’s a clear signal of the direction of travel in software engineering and even AI more broadly. After years of the industry assuming progress in AI is all about scale and speed, we’re starting to see that what matters is the ability to handle context effectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1127478" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TR33_MIT_inline_2.jpg?w=845" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vibes, antipatterns, and new innovations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy coined the term vibe coding. It took the industry by storm. It certainly sparked debate at Thoughtworks; many of us were skeptical. On an April episode of our technology podcast, we talked about our concerns and were cautious about how vibe coding might evolve.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly given the implied imprecision of vibe-based coding, antipatterns have been proliferating. We’ve once again noted, for instance, complacency with AI generated code&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the latest volume of the Technology Radar,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but it’s also worth pointing out that early ventures into vibe coding also exposed a degree of complacency about what AI models can actually handle — users demanded more and prompts grew larger, but model reliability started to falter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimenting with generative AI&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the drivers behind increasing interest in engineering context. We’re well aware of its importance, working with coding assistants like Claude Code and Augment Code.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Providing necessary context—or knowledge priming—is crucial. It ensures outputs are more consistent and reliable, which will ultimately lead to better software that needs less work — reducing rewrites and potentially driving productivity.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When effectively prepared, we’ve seen good results when using generative AI to understand legacy codebases. Indeed, done effectively with the appropriate context, it can even help when we don’t have full access to source code.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that context isn’t just about more data and more detail. This is one of the lessons we’ve taken from using generative AI for forward engineering. It might sound counterintuitive, but in this scenario, we’ve found AI to be more effective when it’s further abstracted from the underlying system — or, in other words, further removed from the specifics of the legacy code. This is because the solution space becomes much wider, allowing us to better leverage the generative and creative capabilities of the AI models we use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context is critical in the agentic era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The backdrop of changes that have happened over recent months is the growth of agents and agentic systems — both as products organizations want to develop and as technology they want to leverage. This has forced the industry to properly reckon with context and move away from a purely vibes-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Indeed, far from simply getting on with tasks they’ve been programmed to do, agents require significant human intervention to ensure they are equipped to respond to complex and dynamic contexts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of context-related technologies aimed at tackling this challenge, including agents.md, Context7, and Mem0. But it’s also a question of approach. For instance, we’ve found success with anchoring coding agents to a reference application&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— essentially providing agents with a contextual ground truth. We’re also experimenting with using teams of coding agents; while this might sound like it increases complexity, it actually removes some of the burden of having to give a single agent all the dense layers of context it needs to do its job successfully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward consensus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hopefully the space will mature as practices and standards embed. It would be remiss to not mention the significance of the Model Context Protocol, which has emerged as the go-to protocol for connecting LLMs or agentic AI to sources of context. Relatedly, the agent2agent (A2A) protocol leads the way with standardizing how agents interact with one another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether these standards win out. But in any case, it’s important to consider the day-to-day practices that allow us, as software engineers and technologists, to collaborate effectively even when dealing with highly complex and dynamic systems. Sure, AI needs context, but so do we. Techniques like curated shared instructions for software teams may not sound like the hottest innovation on the planet, but they can be remarkably powerful for helping teams work together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s perhaps also a conversation to be had about what these changes mean for agile software development. Spec-driven development is one idea that appears to have some traction, but there are still questions about how we remain adaptable and flexible while also building robust contextual foundations and ground truths for AI systems.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software engineers can solve the context challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clearly, 2025 has been a huge year in the evolution of software engineering as a practice. There’s a lot the industry needs to monitor closely, but it’s also an exciting time. And while fears about AI job automation may remain, the fact the conversation has moved from questions of speed and scale to context puts software engineers right at the heart of things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once again, it will be down to them to experiment, collaborate, and learn — the future depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This content was produced by Thoughtworks.

These include card-shaped devices from Plaud and Pocket; pendants from Friend, Limitless, and Taya; and a wristband from Bee, which is now part of Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, two former Meta employees who worked on interface design have launched Sandbar, a startup that has created a ring called Stream for similar purposes. The company calls the ring “a mouse for voice” because it can take notes, help you interact with an AI assistant, and also let you control music.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sandbar’s CEO, Mina Fahmi, has an extensive background in designing human-computer interfaces. He worked at Bryan Johnson’s Kernel and later at smart glasses startup Magic Leap. Kirak Hong, Sandbar’s CTO, worked at Google before joining CTRL-Labs, where the duo met. Meta acquired the startup in 2019, and its work eventually led to neural interfaces for the tech giant’s smart wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064971" height="453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SHINDELVERSE-143.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Sandbar co-founders Kirak Hong and Mina Fahmi Image Credits: Sandbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fahmi said that when large language models started emerging a few years ago, he built an experimental journaling app. However, he found that the app itself became a barrier to capturing his thoughts. Given his experience building hardware interfaces, he began exploring a conversational hardware interface instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of my ideas bubble up when I’m walking or when I’m commuting, and I don’t want to pull out my phone to interrupt that moment. I don’t want to shout into my earbuds where the world can hear me to talk through an idea. Kirak and I were trying to understand what it would take to actually capture a thought the moment it bubbles up. That’s how we came up with Stream,” Fahmi told TechCrunch in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064972" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/walk.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Sandbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ring, designed to be worn on your dominant hand’s index finger, has microphones and a touch pad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a virtual demo, Fahmi wore the Stream ring on his index finger and recorded his thoughts by pressing and holding the touchpad. By default, the microphone is off, activating only with this gesture. The microphone proved sensitive enough to pick up whispers and transcribe them in the companion iOS app. Other apps like Wispr Flow and Willow similarly allow people to capture their thoughts quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stream’s app includes an AI chatbot that converses with you as you record your thoughts. You can organize these into separate notes that either you or the AI can edit. The app also lets you pinch to zoom out and review what you have discussed over days or weeks. Sandbar has added a personalization layer so the assistant’s voice sounds somewhat similar to the user’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[embedded content]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fahmi said that in crowded spaces, users can wear headphones to converse privately with the assistant. Without headphones, the ring provides haptic feedback when it successfully registers a note, allowing you to add to-dos, take notes, or check items off a grocery list quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond voice functions, the ring’s flat surface doubles as a media controller, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust volume. While many headphones offer similar controls, the ring could prove useful when your hands are occupied or you’re in transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is opening up pre-orders for Stream on Wednesday at $249 for the silver version and $299 for gold. Sandbar aims to begin shipping next summer. A Pro subscription tier — free for three months for those who preorder, then $10 per month — offers unlimited chats, notes, and early access to new features.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fahmi said the company gives users full control over their data at any tier, with encryption both at rest and in transit. He added that Sandbar doesn’t believe in walled gardens and plans to support data exports to apps like Notion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sandbar has raised $13 million in funding from True Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Betaworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Toni Schneider, a partner at True Ventures, said he had been skeptical of AI devices, as demos he’d seen before Stream weren’t impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think a lot of people would agree that voice and AI go really well together. And [they also agree] that having a phone or even a laptop to interact with AI is kind of a lot when all you need is voice. So there should be some kind of new form factor out there. We looked at a lot of them, and a lot of them just didn’t quite hit the target. When Mina came in and showed us the demo, it made sense to us,” he told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Competition is fierce in the voice-AI hardware space, with many builders exploring rings as a form factor. Fahmi said he doesn’t want Stream to be an assistant or a companion, but rather an interface for users to express their ideas while maintaining full control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI hardware has yet to achieve mainstream success. Humane sold to HP, Rabbit is attempting to improve user experience and engagement through software updates, and Friend is trying to leverage user backlash to fuel growth. Sandbar will need to prove that its ring form factor offers genuine convenience and value that pendants, pins, or wristbands cannot.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A raft of voice-based hardware devices have emerged, aimed at companionship, productivity, or personal growth. These include card-shaped devices from Plaud and Pocket; pendants from Friend, Limitless, and Taya; and a wristband from Bee, which is now part of Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now, two former Meta employees who worked on interface design have launched Sandbar, a startup that has created a ring called Stream for similar purposes. The company calls the ring “a mouse for voice” because it can take notes, help you interact with an AI assistant, and also let you control music.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sandbar’s CEO, Mina Fahmi, has an extensive background in designing human-computer interfaces. He worked at Bryan Johnson’s Kernel and later at smart glasses startup Magic Leap. Kirak Hong, Sandbar’s CTO, worked at Google before joining CTRL-Labs, where the duo met. Meta acquired the startup in 2019, and its work eventually led to neural interfaces for the tech giant’s smart wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fahmi said that when large language models started emerging a few years ago, he built an experimental journaling app. However, he found that the app itself became a barrier to capturing his thoughts. Given his experience building hardware interfaces, he began exploring a conversational hardware interface instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A lot of my ideas bubble up when I’m walking or when I’m commuting, and I don’t want to pull out my phone to interrupt that moment. I don’t want to shout into my earbuds where the world can hear me to talk through an idea. Kirak and I were trying to understand what it would take to actually capture a thought the moment it bubbles up. That’s how we came up with Stream,” Fahmi told TechCrunch in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3064972" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/walk.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;Image Credits: Sandbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ring, designed to be worn on your dominant hand’s index finger, has microphones and a touch pad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a virtual demo, Fahmi wore the Stream ring on his index finger and recorded his thoughts by pressing and holding the touchpad. By default, the microphone is off, activating only with this gesture. The microphone proved sensitive enough to pick up whispers and transcribe them in the companion iOS app. Other apps like Wispr Flow and Willow similarly allow people to capture their thoughts quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Stream’s app includes an AI chatbot that converses with you as you record your thoughts. You can organize these into separate notes that either you or the AI can edit. The app also lets you pinch to zoom out and review what you have discussed over days or weeks. Sandbar has added a personalization layer so the assistant’s voice sounds somewhat similar to the user’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Fahmi said that in crowded spaces, users can wear headphones to converse privately with the assistant. Without headphones, the ring provides haptic feedback when it successfully registers a note, allowing you to add to-dos, take notes, or check items off a grocery list quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Beyond voice functions, the ring’s flat surface doubles as a media controller, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust volume. While many headphones offer similar controls, the ring could prove useful when your hands are occupied or you’re in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
