Adding others creates a copy of the original thread, preserving the source dialogue. Participants can join via a shareable link and are prompted to create a profile with a name, username, and photo. The feature supports 1 to 20 participants per group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each group chat is listed in a new section of the ChatGPT interface, and users can manage settings like naming the group, adding or removing participants, or muting notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Powered by GPT-5.1 with expanded tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new group chat feature runs on GPT-5.1 Auto, a backend setting that chooses the optimal model based on the user’s subscription tier and the prompt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionality such as search, image generation, file upload, and dictation is available inside group conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the system applies rate limits only when ChatGPT is producing responses. Direct messages between human users in the group do not count toward any plan’s message cap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has added new social features to ChatGPT in support of this group dynamic. The model can react with emojis, interpret conversational context to decide when to respond, and personalize generated content using members’ profile photos—such as inserting user likenesses into images when asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy by default, controls for younger users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI emphasized that privacy and user control are integral to group chat design. The feature operates independently of the user’s personalized ChatGPT memory, and no new memories are created from these interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participation requires an invitation link, and members are always able to see who is in a chat or leave at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users under the age of 18 are automatically shielded from sensitive content in group chats. Parents or guardians can disable group chat access altogether via built-in parental controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group creators retain special permissions, including immunity from being removed by others. All other participants can be added or removed by group members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A testbed for shared AI experiences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI frames group chats as an early step toward richer, multi-user applications of AI, hinting at broader ambitions for ChatGPT as a shared workspace. The company expects to expand access over time and refine the feature based on how early users engage with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyan Zhang’s post suggests that the underlying model capabilities are far ahead of the interfaces users currently interact with. This pilot, in OpenAI’s view, offers a new “container” where more of the model’s latent capacity can be surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our models have a lot more room to shine than today’s experiences show, and the current containers only use a fraction of their capabilities,” Zhang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this initial pilot focused on a limited set of markets, OpenAI is likely monitoring both usage patterns and cultural fit as it plans for broader deployment. For now, the group chat experiment offers a new way for users to interact with ChatGPT—and with each other—in real time, using a conversational interface that blends productivity and personalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer access: Still unclear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has not provided any indication that Group Chats will be accessible via the API or SDK. The current rollout is framed strictly within the ChatGPT product environment, with no mention of tool calls, developer hooks, or integration support for programmatic use. This absence of signaling leaves it unclear whether the company views group interaction as a future developer primitive or as a contained UX feature for end users only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise teams exploring how to replicate multi-user collaboration with generative models, any current implementation would require custom orchestration—such as managing multi-party context and prompts across separate API calls, and handling session state and response merging externally. Until OpenAI provides formal support, Group Chats remain a closed interface feature rather than a developer-accessible capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a standalone concluding subsection tailored for the article, focusing on what the ChatGPT Group Chat rollout means for enterprise decision makers in both pilot regions and globally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implications for enterprise AI and data leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise teams already leveraging AI platforms—or preparing to—OpenAI’s group chat feature introduces a new layer of multi-user collaboration that could shift how generative models are deployed across workflows. While the pilot is limited to users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, its design and roadmap offer key signals for AI engineers, orchestration specialists, and data leads globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI engineers managing large language model (LLM) deployments can now begin to conceptualize real-time, multi-user interfaces not just as support tools, but as collaborative environments for research, content generation, and ideation. This adds another front in model tuning: not just how models respond to individuals, but how they behave in live group settings with context shifts and varied user intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For AI orchestration leads, the ability to integrate ChatGPT into collaborative flows without exposing private memory or requiring custom builds may reduce friction in piloting generative AI in cross-functional teams. These group sessions could serve as lightweight alternatives to internal tools for brainstorming, prototyping, or knowledge sharing—useful for teams constrained by infrastructure, budget, or time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise data managers may also find use cases in structured group chat sessions for data annotation, taxonomy validation, or internal training support. The system’s lack of memory persistence adds a level of data isolation that aligns with standard security and compliance practices—though global rollout will be key to validating regional data handling standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As group chat capabilities evolve, decision makers should monitor how shared usage patterns might inform future model behaviors, auditing needs, and governance structures. In the long term, features like these will influence not just how organizations interact with generative AI, but how they design team-level interfaces around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;It was originally found in &lt;a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1988029080726630822?s=20"&gt;leaked code and publicized by AI influencers on X&lt;/a&gt;, but OpenAI has made it official: &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/group-chats-in-chatgpt/"&gt;ChatGPT now offers Group Chats,&lt;/a&gt; allowing multiple users to join the same, single ChatGPT conversation and send messages to each other and the underlying large language model (LLM), online and via its mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine adding ChatGPT as another member of your existing group chats, allowing you to text it as you would one of your friends or family members and have them respond as well, and you&amp;#x27;ll have an idea of the intriguing power and potential of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the feature is only available as a limited pilot for now to ChatGPT users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan (all tiers, including free usage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a shared space to collaborate and interact with others,” OpenAI wrote in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This development builds on internal experimentation at OpenAI, where technical staffer &lt;a href="https://x.com/keyanzhang/status/1989139444650373281"&gt;Keyan Zhang said in a post on X&lt;/a&gt; that OpenAI&amp;#x27;s team initially considered multiplayer ChatGPT to be “a wild, out-of-distribution idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Zhang, the model’s performance in those early tests demonstrated far more potential than existing interfaces typically allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move follows OpenAI investor yet competitor &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-copilot-gets-12-big-updates-for-fall-including-new-ai-assistant"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s update of its Copilot AI assistant to allow group chats last month&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Anthropic&amp;#x27;s introduction of shareable context and chat histories from its Claude AI models through its &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-ai-assistant-claude-just-got-a-massive-upgrade-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;Projects feature introduced summer 2024&lt;/a&gt;, though this is not a simultaneous, realtime group chat in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaborative functionality integrated into ChatGPT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group chats function as shared conversational spaces where users can plan events, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate on projects with the added support of ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conversations are distinct from individual chats and are excluded from ChatGPT’s memory system—meaning no data from these group threads is used to train or personalize future interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can initiate a group chat by selecting the people icon in a new or existing conversation.

By 2028, enterprises are projected to generate nearly 400 zettabytes of data annually, with 90% of new data being unstructured, comprising audio, video, PDFs, images and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This massive scale, combined with the need for data portability between on-premises infrastructure and the cloud, is pushing the AI industry to evaluate new storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter RDMA for S3-compatible storage — which uses remote direct memory access (RDMA) to accelerate the S3-application programming interface (API)-based storage protocol and is optimized for AI data and workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object storage has long been used as a lower-cost storage option for applications, such as archive, backups, data lakes and activity logs, that didn’t require the fastest performance. While some customers are already using object storage for AI training, they want more performance for the fast-paced world of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution, which incorporates NVIDIA networking, delivers faster and more efficient object storage by using RDMA for object data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers, this means higher throughput per terabyte of storage, higher throughput per watt, lower cost per terabyte and significantly lower latencies compared with TCP, the traditional network transport protocol for object storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower Cost:&lt;/b&gt; End users can lower the cost of their AI storage, which can also speed up project approval and implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workload Portability:&lt;/b&gt; Customers can run their AI workloads unmodified in both on premises and in cloud service provider and neocloud environments, using a common storage API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerated Storage: &lt;/b&gt;Faster data access and performance for AI training and inference — including vector databases and key-value cache storage for inference in AI factories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI data platform&lt;/b&gt; solutions gain faster storage object storage access and more metadata for content indexing and retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduced CPU Utilization:&lt;/b&gt; RDMA for S3-compatible storage doesn’t use the host CPU for data transfer, meaning this critical resource is available to deliver AI value for customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA has developed RDMA client and server libraries to accelerate object storage. Storage partners have integrated these server libraries into their storage solutions to enable RDMA data transfer for S3-API-based object storage, leading to faster data transfers and higher efficiency for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client libraries for RDMA for S3-compatible storage run on AI GPU compute nodes. This allows AI workloads to access object storage data much faster than traditional TCP access — improving AI workload performance and GPU utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the initial libraries are optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and networking, the architecture itself is open, because other vendors and customers can contribute to the client libraries and incorporate them into their software. They can also write their own software to support and use the RDMA for S3-compatible storage APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standardization, Availability and Adoption &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA is working with partners to standardize RDMA for S3-compatible storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several key object storage partners are already adopting the new technology. Cloudian, Dell Technologies and HPE are all incorporating RDMA for S3-compatible libraries into their high-performance object storage products: Cloudian HyperStore, Dell ObjectScale and the HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Object storage is the future of scalable data management for AI,” said Jon Toor, chief marketing officer at Cloudian. “Cloudian is leading efforts with NVIDIA to standardize RDMA for S3-compatible storage, which enables faster, more efficient object storage that helps scale AI solutions and reduce storage costs. Standardization and Cloudian’s S3-API compatibility will seamlessly bring scalability and performance to thousands of existing S3-based applications and tools, both on premises and in the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI workloads demand storage performance at scale with thousands of GPUs reading or writing data concurrently, and enterprise customers, with multiple AI factories — on premises and in the cloud — desire AI workload portability for objects,” said Rajesh Rajaraman, chief technology officer and vice president of Dell Technologies Storage, Data and Cyber Resilience. “Dell Technologies has collaborated with NVIDIA to integrate RDMA for S3-compatible storage acceleration into Dell ObjectScale, object storage that delivers unmatched scalability, performance and dramatically lower latency with end-to-end RDMA. The latest Dell ObjectScale software update will provide an excellent storage foundation for AI factories and AI data platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As AI workloads continue to grow in scale and intensity, NVIDIA’s innovations in RDMA for S3-compatible storage APIs and libraries are redefining how data moves at massive scale,” said Jim O’Dorisio, senior vice president and general manager of storage at HPE. “Working closely with NVIDIA, HPE has built a solution that accelerates throughput, reduces latency and lowers total cost of ownership. With RDMA for S3-compatible storage capabilities now integrated into HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000, we are extending our leadership in intelligent, scalable storage for unstructured and AI-driven workloads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA’s RDMA for S3-compatible storage libraries are now available to select partners and are expected to be generally available via the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; in January.

Cloudian, Dell Technologies and HPE are all incorporating RDMA for S3-compatible libraries into their high-performance object storage products: Cloudian HyperStore, Dell ObjectScale and the HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Object storage is the future of scalable data management for AI,” said Jon Toor, chief marketing officer at Cloudian. “Cloudian is leading efforts with NVIDIA to standardize RDMA for S3-compatible storage, which enables faster, more efficient object storage that helps scale AI solutions and reduce storage costs. Standardization and Cloudian’s S3-API compatibility will seamlessly bring scalability and performance to thousands of existing S3-based applications and tools, both on premises and in the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AI workloads demand storage performance at scale with thousands of GPUs reading or writing data concurrently, and enterprise customers, with multiple AI factories — on premises and in the cloud — desire AI workload portability for objects,” said Rajesh Rajaraman, chief technology officer and vice president of Dell Technologies Storage, Data and Cyber Resilience. “Dell Technologies has collaborated with NVIDIA to integrate RDMA for S3-compatible storage acceleration into Dell ObjectScale, object storage that delivers unmatched scalability, performance and dramatically lower latency with end-to-end RDMA. The latest Dell ObjectScale software update will provide an excellent storage foundation for AI factories and AI data platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As AI workloads continue to grow in scale and intensity, NVIDIA’s innovations in RDMA for S3-compatible storage APIs and libraries are redefining how data moves at massive scale,” said Jim O’Dorisio, senior vice president and general manager of storage at HPE. “Working closely with NVIDIA, HPE has built a solution that accelerates throughput, reduces latency and lowers total cost of ownership. With RDMA for S3-compatible storage capabilities now integrated into HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000, we are extending our leadership in intelligent, scalable storage for unstructured and AI-driven workloads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA’s RDMA for S3-compatible storage libraries are now available to select partners and are expected to be generally available via the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; in January.

The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Of course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it’s been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation.

In a post on X, Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em dashes have become what many believe to be a telltale sign of AI-generated text over the past few years. The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fact that it’s been 3 years since ChatGPT first launched, and you’ve only just now managed to make it obey this simple requirement, says a lot about how little control you have over it, and your understanding of its inner workings,” wrote one X user in a reply. “Not a good sign for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Altman likes to publicly talk about AGI (a hypothetical technology equivalent to humans in general learning ability), superintelligence (a nebulous concept for AI that is far beyond human intelligence), and “magic intelligence in the sky” (his term for AI cloud computing?) while raising funds for OpenAI, it’s clear that we still don’t have reliable artificial intelligence here today on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, what is an em dash anyway, and why does it matter so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI models love em dashes because we do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a hyphen, which is a short punctuation mark used to connect words or parts of words, that lives with a dedicated key on your keyboard (-), an em dash is a long dash denoted by a special character (—) that writers use to set off parenthetical information, indicate a sudden change in thought, or introduce a summary or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the age of AI language models, some writers frequently bemoaned the overuse of the em dash in modern writing. In a 2011 Slate article, writer Noreen Malone argued that writers used the em dash “in lieu of properly crafting sentences” and that overreliance on it “discourages truly efficient writing.” Various Reddit threads posted prior to ChatGPT’s launch featured writers either wrestling over the etiquette of proper em dash use or admitting to their frequent use as a guilty pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, one writer in the r/FanFiction subreddit wrote, “For the longest time, I’ve been addicted to Em Dashes. They find their way into every paragraph I write. I love the crisp straight line that gives me the excuse to shove details or thoughts into an otherwise orderly paragraph. Even after coming back to write after like two years of writer’s block, I immediately cram as many em dashes as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tendency for AI chatbots to overuse them, detection tools and human readers have learned to spot em dash use as a pattern, creating a problem for the small subset of writers who naturally favor the punctuation mark in their work. As a result, some journalists are complaining that AI is “killing” the em dash.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;No one knows precisely why LLMs tend to overuse em dashes. We’ve seen a wide range of speculation online that attempts to explain the phenomenon, from noticing that em dashes were more popular in 19th-century books used as training data (according to a 2018 study, dash use in the English language peaked around 1860 before declining through the mid-20th century) or perhaps AI models borrowed the habit from automatic em-dash character conversion on the blogging site Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we know for sure is that LLMs tend to output frequently seen patterns in their training data (fed in during the initial training process) and from a subsequent reinforcement learning process that often relies on human preferences. As a result, AI language models feed you a sort of “smoothed out” average style of whatever you ask them to provide, moderated by whatever they are conditioned to produce through user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the most plausible explanation is still that requests for professional-style writing from an AI model trained on vast numbers of examples from the Internet will lean heavily toward the prevailing style in the training data, where em dashes appear frequently in formal writing, news articles, and editorial content. It’s also possible that during training through human feedback (called RLHF), responses with em dashes, for whatever reason, received higher ratings. Perhaps it’s because those outputs appeared more sophisticated or engaging to evaluators, but that’s just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From em dashes to AGI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what Altman’s “win” really means, and what it says about the road to AGI, we need to understand how ChatGPT’s custom instructions actually work. They allow users to set persistent preferences that apply across all conversations by appending written instructions to the prompt that is fed into the model just before the chat begins. Users can specify tone, format, and style requirements without needing to repeat those requests manually in every new chat.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;However, the feature has not always worked reliably because LLMs do not work reliably (even OpenAI and Anthropic freely admit this). An LLM takes an input and produces an output, spitting out a statistically plausible continuation of a prompt (a system prompt, the custom instructions, and your chat history), and it doesn’t really “understand” what you are asking. With AI language model outputs, there is always some luck involved in getting them to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our informal testing of GPT-5.1 with custom instructions, ChatGPT did appear to follow our request not to produce em dashes. But despite Altman’s claim, the response from X users appears to show that experiences with the feature continue to vary, at least when the request is not placed in custom instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if LLMs are statistical text-generation boxes, what does “instruction following” even mean? That’s key to unpacking the hypothetical path from LLMs to AGI. The concept of following instructions for an LLM is fundamentally different from how we typically think about following instructions as humans with general intelligence, or even a traditional computer program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional computing, instruction following is deterministic. You tell a program “don’t include character X,” and it won’t include that character. The program executes rules exactly as written. With LLMs, “instruction following” is really about shifting statistical probabilities. When you tell ChatGPT “don’t use em dashes,” you’re not creating a hard rule. You’re adding text to the prompt that makes tokens associated with em dashes less likely to be selected during the generation process. But “less likely” isn’t “impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every token the model generates is selected from a probability distribution. Your custom instruction influences that distribution, but it’s competing with the model’s training data (where em dashes appeared frequently in certain contexts) and everything else in the prompt. Unlike code with conditional logic, there’s no separate system verifying outputs against your requirements. The instruction is just more text that influences the statistical prediction process.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Altman celebrates finally getting GPT to avoid em dashes, he’s really celebrating that OpenAI has tuned the latest version of GPT-5.1 (probably through reinforcement learning or fine-tuning) to weight custom instructions more heavily in its probability calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an irony about control here: Given the probabilistic nature of the issue, there’s no guarantee the issue will stay fixed. OpenAI continuously updates its models behind the scenes, even within the same version number, adjusting outputs based on user feedback and new training runs. Each update arrives with different output characteristics that can undo previous behavioral tuning, a phenomenon researchers call the “alignment tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely tuning a neural network’s behavior is not yet an exact science. Since all concepts encoded in the network are interconnected by values called weights, adjusting one behavior can alter others in unintended ways. Fix em dash overuse today, and tomorrow’s update (aimed at improving, say, coding capabilities) might inadvertently bring them back, not because OpenAI wants them there, but because that’s the nature of trying to steer a statistical system with millions of competing influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets to an implied question we mentioned earlier. If controlling punctuation use is still a struggle that might pop back up at any time, how far are we from AGI? We can’t know for sure, but it seems increasingly likely that it won’t emerge from a large language model alone. That’s because AGI, a technology that would replicate human general learning ability, would likely require true understanding and self-reflective intentional action, not statistical pattern matching that sometimes aligns with instructions if you happen to get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of getting lucky, some users still aren’t having luck with controlling em dash use outside of the “custom instructions” feature. Upon being told in-chat to not use em dashes within a chat, ChatGPT updated a saved memory and replied to one X user, “Got it—I’ll stick strictly to short hyphens from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em dashes have become what many believe to be a telltale sign of AI-generated text over the past few years. The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fact that it’s been 3 years since ChatGPT first launched, and you’ve only just now managed to make it obey this simple requirement, says a lot about how little control you have over it, and your understanding of its inner workings,” wrote one X user in a reply. “Not a good sign for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Altman likes to publicly talk about AGI (a hypothetical technology equivalent to humans in general learning ability), superintelligence (a nebulous concept for AI that is far beyond human intelligence), and “magic intelligence in the sky” (his term for AI cloud computing?) while raising funds for OpenAI, it’s clear that we still don’t have reliable artificial intelligence here today on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, what is an em dash anyway, and why does it matter so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI models love em dashes because we do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a hyphen, which is a short punctuation mark used to connect words or parts of words, that lives with a dedicated key on your keyboard (-), an em dash is a long dash denoted by a special character (—) that writers use to set off parenthetical information, indicate a sudden change in thought, or introduce a summary or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the age of AI language models, some writers frequently bemoaned the overuse of the em dash in modern writing. In a 2011 Slate article, writer Noreen Malone argued that writers used the em dash “in lieu of properly crafting sentences” and that overreliance on it “discourages truly efficient writing.” Various Reddit threads posted prior to ChatGPT’s launch featured writers either wrestling over the etiquette of proper em dash use or admitting to their frequent use as a guilty pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, one writer in the r/FanFiction subreddit wrote, “For the longest time, I’ve been addicted to Em Dashes. They find their way into every paragraph I write. I love the crisp straight line that gives me the excuse to shove details or thoughts into an otherwise orderly paragraph. Even after coming back to write after like two years of writer’s block, I immediately cram as many em dashes as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tendency for AI chatbots to overuse them, detection tools and human readers have learned to spot em dash use as a pattern, creating a problem for the small subset of writers who naturally favor the punctuation mark in their work. As a result, some journalists are complaining that AI is “killing” the em dash.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;No one knows precisely why LLMs tend to overuse em dashes. We’ve seen a wide range of speculation online that attempts to explain the phenomenon, from noticing that em dashes were more popular in 19th-century books used as training data (according to a 2018 study, dash use in the English language peaked around 1860 before declining through the mid-20th century) or perhaps AI models borrowed the habit from automatic em-dash character conversion on the blogging site Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we know for sure is that LLMs tend to output frequently seen patterns in their training data (fed in during the initial training process) and from a subsequent reinforcement learning process that often relies on human preferences. As a result, AI language models feed you a sort of “smoothed out” average style of whatever you ask them to provide, moderated by whatever they are conditioned to produce through user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the most plausible explanation is still that requests for professional-style writing from an AI model trained on vast numbers of examples from the Internet will lean heavily toward the prevailing style in the training data, where em dashes appear frequently in formal writing, news articles, and editorial content. It’s also possible that during training through human feedback (called RLHF), responses with em dashes, for whatever reason, received higher ratings. Perhaps it’s because those outputs appeared more sophisticated or engaging to evaluators, but that’s just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From em dashes to AGI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what Altman’s “win” really means, and what it says about the road to AGI, we need to understand how ChatGPT’s custom instructions actually work. They allow users to set persistent preferences that apply across all conversations by appending written instructions to the prompt that is fed into the model just before the chat begins. Users can specify tone, format, and style requirements without needing to repeat those requests manually in every new chat.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;However, the feature has not always worked reliably because LLMs do not work reliably (even OpenAI and Anthropic freely admit this). An LLM takes an input and produces an output, spitting out a statistically plausible continuation of a prompt (a system prompt, the custom instructions, and your chat history), and it doesn’t really “understand” what you are asking. With AI language model outputs, there is always some luck involved in getting them to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our informal testing of GPT-5.1 with custom instructions, ChatGPT did appear to follow our request not to produce em dashes. But despite Altman’s claim, the response from X users appears to show that experiences with the feature continue to vary, at least when the request is not placed in custom instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if LLMs are statistical text-generation boxes, what does “instruction following” even mean? That’s key to unpacking the hypothetical path from LLMs to AGI. The concept of following instructions for an LLM is fundamentally different from how we typically think about following instructions as humans with general intelligence, or even a traditional computer program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional computing, instruction following is deterministic. You tell a program “don’t include character X,” and it won’t include that character. The program executes rules exactly as written. With LLMs, “instruction following” is really about shifting statistical probabilities. When you tell ChatGPT “don’t use em dashes,” you’re not creating a hard rule. You’re adding text to the prompt that makes tokens associated with em dashes less likely to be selected during the generation process. But “less likely” isn’t “impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every token the model generates is selected from a probability distribution. Your custom instruction influences that distribution, but it’s competing with the model’s training data (where em dashes appeared frequently in certain contexts) and everything else in the prompt. Unlike code with conditional logic, there’s no separate system verifying outputs against your requirements. The instruction is just more text that influences the statistical prediction process.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;When Altman celebrates finally getting GPT to avoid em dashes, he’s really celebrating that OpenAI has tuned the latest version of GPT-5.1 (probably through reinforcement learning or fine-tuning) to weight custom instructions more heavily in its probability calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an irony about control here: Given the probabilistic nature of the issue, there’s no guarantee the issue will stay fixed. OpenAI continuously updates its models behind the scenes, even within the same version number, adjusting outputs based on user feedback and new training runs. Each update arrives with different output characteristics that can undo previous behavioral tuning, a phenomenon researchers call the “alignment tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely tuning a neural network’s behavior is not yet an exact science. Since all concepts encoded in the network are interconnected by values called weights, adjusting one behavior can alter others in unintended ways. Fix em dash overuse today, and tomorrow’s update (aimed at improving, say, coding capabilities) might inadvertently bring them back, not because OpenAI wants them there, but because that’s the nature of trying to steer a statistical system with millions of competing influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets to an implied question we mentioned earlier. If controlling punctuation use is still a struggle that might pop back up at any time, how far are we from AGI? We can’t know for sure, but it seems increasingly likely that it won’t emerge from a large language model alone. That’s because AGI, a technology that would replicate human general learning ability, would likely require true understanding and self-reflective intentional action, not statistical pattern matching that sometimes aligns with instructions if you happen to get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of getting lucky, some users still aren’t having luck with controlling em dash use outside of the “custom instructions” feature. Upon being told in-chat to not use em dashes within a chat, ChatGPT updated a saved memory and replied to one X user, “Got it—I’ll stick strictly to short hyphens from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-2025"&gt;November 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-1-with-advanced-reasoning-and-user-friendly-tone"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT‑5.1 with advanced reasoning and user-friendly tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-munich-court-says-chatgpt-violated-music-copyright-laws"&gt;Munich court says ChatGPT violated music copyright laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-eyes-consumer-health-market-with-ai-powered-tools"&gt;OpenAI eyes consumer health market with AI-powered tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is exploring the consumer health sector, developing AI tools like personal health assistants and data aggregators, according to a report by Business Insider. With new healthcare-focused hires, it aims to simplify access to fragmented medical data — an area where Big Tech has struggled — through its conversational AI approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-more-families-accuse-openai-of-negligence-over-chatgpt-related-suicides"&gt;Seven more families accuse OpenAI of negligence over ChatGPT-related suicides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reaches-1million-business-clients-in-record-time"&gt;OpenAI reaches 1million business clients in record time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On November 5, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally now use its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries like finance, healthcare, and retail, including Amgen, Booking.com, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, T-Mobile, Target, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, are using ChatGPT and OpenAI’s developer tools to enhance operations and customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-working-on-ai-that-create-music-from-text-and-audio"&gt;OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-atlas-to-make-chatgpt-your-main-search-tool"&gt;OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-chatgpt-go-plan-to-16-more-asian-countries"&gt;OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-surpasses-800-million-weekly-active-users"&gt;ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-can-now-build-apps-inside-chatgpt"&gt;Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="september2025"&gt;September 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-chatgpt-pulse-for-personalized-morning-briefs"&gt;OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-budget-friendly-chatgpt-go-to-indonesian-users"&gt;OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="august2025"&gt;August 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-strengthen-chatgpt-safeguards-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to strengthen ChatGPT safeguards after teen suicide lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xai-claims-apple-s-app-store-practices-give-openai-an-unfair-advantage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI claims Apple’s App Store practices give OpenAI an unfair advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-addresses-gpt-5-glitches-and-chart-crime-during-reddit-ama"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman addresses GPT-5 glitches and “chart crime” during Reddit AMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is continually updated with new information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2191707579.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-november-2025"&gt;November 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-1-with-advanced-reasoning-and-user-friendly-tone"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT‑5.1 with advanced reasoning and user-friendly tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-munich-court-says-chatgpt-violated-music-copyright-laws"&gt;Munich court says ChatGPT violated music copyright laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-eyes-consumer-health-market-with-ai-powered-tools"&gt;OpenAI eyes consumer health market with AI-powered tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is exploring the consumer health sector, developing AI tools like personal health assistants and data aggregators, according to a report by Business Insider. With new healthcare-focused hires, it aims to simplify access to fragmented medical data — an area where Big Tech has struggled — through its conversational AI approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-more-families-accuse-openai-of-negligence-over-chatgpt-related-suicides"&gt;Seven more families accuse OpenAI of negligence over ChatGPT-related suicides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reaches-1million-business-clients-in-record-time"&gt;OpenAI reaches 1million business clients in record time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On November 5, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally now use its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries like finance, healthcare, and retail, including Amgen, Booking.com, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, T-Mobile, Target, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, are using ChatGPT and OpenAI’s developer tools to enhance operations and customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-october-2025"&gt;October 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-handles-over-a-million-suicide-related-conversations-weekly"&gt;ChatGPT handles over a million suicide-related conversations weekly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-working-on-ai-that-create-music-from-text-and-audio"&gt;OpenAI reportedly working on AI that create music from text and audio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-gets-smarter-at-organizing-your-work-and-school-info"&gt;ChatGPT gets smarter at organizing your work and school info&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-atlas-to-make-chatgpt-your-main-search-tool"&gt;OpenAI launches Atlas to make ChatGPT your main search tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-app-growth-slows-but-still-draws-millions-of-daily-users"&gt;ChatGPT app growth slows, but still draws millions of daily users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walmart-shopping-comes-to-chatgpt"&gt;Walmart shopping comes to ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-chatgpt-go-plan-to-16-more-asian-countries"&gt;OpenAI brings ChatGPT Go plan to 16 more Asian countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-surpasses-800-million-weekly-active-users"&gt;ChatGPT surpasses 800 million weekly active users &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developers-can-now-build-apps-inside-chatgpt"&gt;Developers can now build apps inside ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="september2025"&gt;September 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-rolls-out-parental-controls-following-teen-suicide-case"&gt;ChatGPT rolls out parental controls following teen suicide case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-introduces-chatgpt-pulse-for-personalized-morning-briefs"&gt;OpenAI introduces ChatGPT Pulse for personalized morning briefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-moves-into-ai-powered-shopping-challenging-tech-giants"&gt;OpenAI moves into AI-Powered shopping, challenging tech giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-brings-budget-friendly-chatgpt-go-to-indonesian-users"&gt;OpenAI brings budget-friendly ChatGPT Go to Indonesian users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tightens-chatgpt-rules-for-teens-amid-safety-concerns"&gt;OpenAI tightens ChatGPT rules for teens amid safety concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-rolls-out-gpt-5-codex-to-power-smarter-ai-coding"&gt;OpenAI rolls out GPT-5-Codex to power smarter AI coding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reshuffles-team-behind-chatgpt-s-personality"&gt;OpenAI reshuffles team behind ChatGPT’s personality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="august2025"&gt;August 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-strengthen-chatgpt-safeguards-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to strengthen ChatGPT safeguards after teen suicide lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xai-claims-apple-s-app-store-practices-give-openai-an-unfair-advantage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xAI claims Apple’s App Store practices give OpenAI an unfair advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-targets-india-with-cheaper-monthly-chatgpt-subscription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI targets India with cheaper monthly ChatGPT subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-mobile-app-hits-2b-in-revenue-2-91-earned-per-install"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT mobile app hits $2B in revenue, $2.91 earned per install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-keeps-multiple-gpt-models-despite-gpt-5-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI keeps multiple GPT models despite GPT-5 launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-5-a-smarter-task-ready-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-5, a smarter, task-ready ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-enterprise-to-federal-agencies-for-just-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-returns-to-open-source-with-new-ai-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI returns to open source with new AI models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-nears-700m-weekly-users-quadruples-growth-in-a-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT nears 700M weekly users, quadruples growth in a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-has-study-mode"&gt;ChatGPT now has study mode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altman-warns-that-chatgpt-therapy-isn-t-confidential"&gt;Altman warns that ChatGPT therapy isn’t confidential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-hits-2-5b-prompts-daily"&gt;ChatGPT hits 2.5B prompts daily&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt"&gt;OpenAI launches a general-purpose agent in ChatGPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-warns-of-major-risks-with-ai-therapy-chatbots"&gt;Study warns of major risks with AI therapy chatbots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-delays-releasing-its-open-model-again"&gt;OpenAI delays releasing its open model again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) July 12, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-is-testing-a-mysterious-new-feature-called-study-together"&gt;ChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called “study together”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-referrals-from-chatgpt-to-news-sites-are-rising-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are rising but not enough to offset search declines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="june2025"&gt;June 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-uses-google-s-ai-chips-to-power-its-products"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-Nvidia chips in an important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-mit-study-suggests-that-chatgpt-might-be-harming-critical-thinking-skills"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-was-downloaded-30-million-times-last-month"&gt;ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-energy-needed-for-an-average-chatgpt-query-can-power-a-lightbulb-for-a-couple-of-minutes"&gt;The energy needed for an average ChatGPT query can power a lightbulb for a couple of minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o3-pro-an-upgraded-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an upgraded version of its o3 AI reasoning model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…&lt;/p&gt;— OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-conversational-voice-mode-has-been-upgraded"&gt;ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode has been upgraded&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-added-new-features-like-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT has added new features like meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cfo-says-hardware-will-drive-chatgpt-s-growth"&gt;OpenAI CFO says hardware will drive ChatGPT’s growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-chatgpt-unveils-its-ai-coding-agent-codex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT unveils its AI coding agent, Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-altman-aims-to-make-chatgpt-more-personalized-by-tracking-every-aspect-of-a-person-s-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Altman aims to make ChatGPT more personalized by tracking every aspect of a person’s life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-releases-its-gpt-4-1-and-gpt-4-1-mini-ai-models-in-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI releases its GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini AI models in ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
 &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks &amp;amp; instruction following.

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-deep-research-now-connects-with-github-in-beta-to-answer-code-related-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT deep research now connects with GitHub (in beta) to answer code-related questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-a-new-data-residency-program-in-asia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches a new data residency program in Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-to-introduce-a-program-to-grow-ai-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI to introduce a program to grow AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-promises-to-make-changes-to-prevent-future-chatgpt-sycophancy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-april-2025"&gt;April 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-clarifies-the-reason-chatgpt-became-overly-flattering-and-agreeable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-to-fix-a-bug-that-let-minors-engage-in-inappropriate-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-helps-users-by-giving-recommendations-showing-images-and-reviewing-products-for-online-shopping"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-wants-its-ai-model-to-access-cloud-models-for-assistance"&gt;OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-aims-to-make-its-new-open-ai-model-the-best-on-the-market"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-gpt-4-1-may-be-less-aligned-than-earlier-models"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company&amp;nbsp;skipped that step — sending safety cards&amp;nbsp;for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-ai-model-scored-lower-than-expected-on-a-benchmark"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-latest-ai-models-now-have-a-safeguard-against-biorisks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-its-latest-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-added-a-new-section-to-chatgpt-to-offer-easier-access-to-ai-generated-images-for-all-user-tiers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-adjust-its-safeguards-if-rivals-release-high-risk-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-building-its-own-social-media-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is building its own social media network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-remove-its-largest-ai-model-gpt-4-5-from-the-api-in-july"&gt;OpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-gpt-4-1-ai-models-that-focus-on-coding-capabilities"&gt;OpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-will-discontinue-chatgpt-s-gpt-4-at-the-end-of-april"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-could-release-gpt-4-1-soon"&gt;OpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-updated-chatgpt-to-use-information-from-your-previous-conversations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-is-working-on-watermarks-for-images-made-with-chatgpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-offers-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-u-s-canadian-college-students"&gt;OpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-users-have-generated-over-700m-images-nbsp-so-far"&gt;ChatGPT users have generated over 700M images&amp;nbsp;so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-o3-model-could-cost-more-to-run-than-initial-estimate"&gt;OpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-ceo-says-capacity-issues-will-cause-product-delays"&gt;OpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-march-2025"&gt;March 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-plans-to-release-a-new-open-ai-language-model"&gt;OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-removes-chatgpt-s-restrictions-on-image-generation"&gt;OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-adopts-anthropic-s-standard-for-linking-ai-models-with-data"&gt;OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-viral-studio-ghibli-style-images-could-raise-ai-copyright-concerns"&gt;OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-expects-revenue-to-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year"&gt;OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-has-upgraded-its-image-generation-feature"&gt;ChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-announces-leadership-updates"&gt;OpenAI announces leadership updates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-ai-voice-assistant-now-has-advanced-feature"&gt;OpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-meta-in-talks-with-reliance-in-india"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-faces-privacy-complaint-in-europe-for-chatbot-s-defamatory-hallucinations"&gt;OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at&amp;nbsp;Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models"&gt;OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-has-launched-o1-pro-a-more-powerful-version-of-its-o1"&gt;OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-research-lead-noam-brown-thinks-ai-reasoning-models-could-ve-arrived-decades-ago"&gt;OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-that-s-really-good-at-creative-writing"&gt;OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a&amp;nbsp;post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet wp-block-html"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please write a metafictional literary short story…&lt;/p&gt;— Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20-000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents"&gt;OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-can-directly-edit-your-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT can directly edit your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-weekly-active-users-doubled-in-less-than-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases"&gt;ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-february-2025"&gt;February 2025 &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release"&gt;OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-may-not-be-as-power-hungry-as-once-assumed"&gt;ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-now-reveals-more-of-its-o3-mini-model-s-thought-process"&gt;OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-now-use-chatgpt-web-search-without-logging-in"&gt;You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research"&gt;OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-january-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion"&gt;OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model"&gt;OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says"&gt;ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies"&gt;OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults"&gt;More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days"&gt;OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously"&gt;OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-may-preview-its-agent-tool-for-users-on-the-200-per-month-pro-plan"&gt;OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups"&gt;OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks"&gt;ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z"&gt;New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faqs"&gt;FAQs:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is ChatGPT? How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When did ChatGPT get released?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the latest version of ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can I use ChatGPT for free?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who uses ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What companies use ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp; And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT write essays?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT commit libel?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the ChatGPT character limit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Does ChatGPT have an API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How good is ChatGPT at writing code?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can you save a ChatGPT chat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out&amp;nbsp;this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here&amp;nbsp;for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can ChatGPT be detected?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are ChatGPT chats public?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.&lt;/p&gt;

Konwinski is a Databricks co-founder and the co-founder of the AI research and venture capital firm Laude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they’ll tell you that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,” Konwinski said onstage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit this week. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to investing through Laude, the venture fund he launched last year with NEA veteran Pete Sonsini and Antimatter CEO Andrew Krioukov, Konwinski also runs the Laude Institute, an accelerator that offers grants to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Major AI labs, including OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, continue to innovate significantly, yet their innovations remain largely proprietary rather than open source. Moreover, these companies are sucking up top academic talent by offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf what these experts can earn in universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Konwinski argued that for ideas to truly flourish, they need to be freely exchanged and discussed with the larger academic community. He pointed out that generative AI emerged as a direct result of the Transformer architecture, a pivotal training technique introduced in a freely available research paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The first nation that makes the next ‘Transformer architectural level’ breakthrough will have the advantage,” Konwinski said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Konwinski argues that in China, the government supports and encourages AI innovation, whether from labs like DeepSeek or Alibaba’s Qwen, to be open sourced, which allows others to build upon them and which, he contends, will inevitably lead to more breakthroughs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Experiments show that SRL not only excels on math reasoning benchmarks but also generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRL is a versatile training framework that can elevate smaller and less expensive models to higher reasoning abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The limits of current LLM reasoning training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning have largely been driven by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a method where a model is rewarded based on the correctness of its final answer. By repeatedly trying to solve problems and getting feedback on the final outcome, the model gradually learns effective problem-solving strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the success of this outcome-based approach depends on the model&amp;#x27;s ability to discover a correct solution within a limited number of attempts, or &amp;quot;rollouts.&amp;quot; Since each rollout is computationally expensive, models can&amp;#x27;t try indefinitely. This method hits a wall when problems are so difficult that the model rarely, if ever, finds the right answer within its budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a critical learning bottleneck. In many multi-step reasoning problems, a model might correctly solve several steps but get derailed by a single mistake, leading to an incorrect answer. With RLVR, this entire effort receives a negative reward, and the model learns nothing from its partially correct work. It’s an all-or-nothing approach that fails to provide granular feedback and provides sparse rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative method is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model learns from examples containing the full reasoning process laid out by experts. While SFT can instill reasoning abilities, it often leads to overfitting (the model simply learns to imitate the trajectories in the training data instead of learning to generalize to problems beyond the examples it has seen). This issue is made worse by the fact that high-quality, human-created training data is both scarce and expensive to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the paper notes, these limitations leave &amp;quot;a critical gap for training small open-source models to effectively learn difficult problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How supervised reinforcement learning works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRL introduces a framework that reformulates problem-solving as a &amp;quot;sequential decision-making process,&amp;quot; striking a balance between pure outcome-based RL and pure imitation learning. Instead of optimizing only for the final answer or forcing the model to imitate an expert&amp;#x27;s entire thought process, SRL teaches the model to reproduce a sequence of key actions that form the backbone of expert reasoning. This allows the model to learn to take actions similar to an expert while developing its own internal reasoning style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the SRL framework, expert demonstrations are broken down into a series of intermediate, concrete actions, each representing a meaningful step. For a math problem, an action might be an algebraic manipulation. For a software engineering agent, it could be a command executed in a code repository. To generate training data, SRL uses a powerful teacher model to create solution trajectories, which are then used to train a smaller model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to I-Hung Hsu, a research scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this middle-ground approach is key to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. &amp;quot;SRL sits in the middle: It captures the structured flexibility of real-world problem solving, where there are multiple valid strategies but also clear notions of what ‘good reasoning’ looks like at each step,&amp;quot; Hsu told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;This makes SRL suitable for domains like data science automation or probably supply chain optimization — tasks that reward sound intermediate reasoning rather than mere final answers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, the model first generates an &amp;quot;inner monologue&amp;quot; (its internal reasoning process, enclosed in &amp;lt;think&amp;gt; tags) before committing to an action. At each step, SRL provides a reward based on the similarity between the model&amp;#x27;s predicted action and the expert&amp;#x27;s action. This step-wise reward system provides dense, fine-grained feedback, allowing the model to learn and improve even if its overall solution isn&amp;#x27;t perfect. This solves the sparse reward problem RLVR faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SRL in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers&amp;#x27; experiments show that SRL significantly outperforms strong baselines in both challenging mathematical reasoning and agentic software engineering benchmarks. They also observed that SRL encourages more flexible and sophisticated reasoning patterns in models, such as interleaved planning and self-verification, which improve solution quality without just making the outputs longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, performance gains are only valuable if they don&amp;#x27;t come with runaway costs. Hsu clarifies that SRL-trained models are more efficient in their reasoning. &amp;quot;The gains come from better reasoning quality and structure, not from verbosity,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;In terms of efficiency, SRL-trained models are roughly on par with the base model in token usage... while SRL isn’t designed to reduce inference cost, it achieves stronger reasoning performance without increasing it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the math tests, the team fine-tuned &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a dataset of 1,000 difficult math questions. They compared its performance against models trained with SFT and RLVR (using the GRPO algorithm common in models like &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DeepSeek-R1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on four competition-level math benchmarks. The SRL-trained model achieved a substantial 3.0% average performance boost over other methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team extended SRL to agentic software engineering, a domain critical for enterprise automation. They trained a coding-specialized model, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-new-ai-can-code-in-92-languages-and-its-completely-free"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on 5,000 expert trajectories of agents interacting with a coding environment. The SRL-trained model was benchmarked against the original base model and SWE-Gym-7B, a strong baseline fine-tuned with SFT. SRL achieved a 14.8% task resolve rate, representing a 74% relative improvement over the SFT-based model. This shows SRL&amp;#x27;s ability to train more competent AI agents for complex, real-world programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new standard for high-stakes AI?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper&amp;#x27;s strongest results came from combining methods: First, using SRL to teach foundational reasoning, then using RLVR to refine that skill. In their experiments, when the researchers used SRL as a pre-training and applied RLVR in post-training, they observed a 3.7% average increase, demonstrating a powerful curriculum learning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of whether this could become a new blueprint for building specialized AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We view SRL as a strong foundation,&amp;quot; Hsu said. &amp;quot;In a sense, SRL provides a curriculum — teaching models to think and act step by step — before we refine those behaviors with outcome-based reinforcement learning. This SRL-first approach not only stabilizes the later RL stage but also makes reasoning more interpretable and generalizable, which is critical for high-stakes applications.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Hsu acknowledges that scaling this pipeline still faces challenges, particularly the high cost and complexity of end-to-end RLVR for agentic tasks. However, he is optimistic about the path forward. &amp;quot;While high-quality expert trajectories remain important,&amp;quot; he concluded, &amp;quot;we think the next big leap will come from automating their generation and filtering — leveraging strong teacher models or even self-improving student models to bootstrap new data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai-research/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu/"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; have proposed a new reinforcement learning framework that significantly improves the ability of language models to learn very challenging multi-step reasoning tasks. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Supervised Reinforcement Learning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SRL) reformulates problem-solving as a sequence of logical “actions,” providing rich learning signals during the training process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach enables smaller models to learn complex problems that were previously out of reach for other common training techniques.

Hsu clarifies that SRL-trained models are more efficient in their reasoning. &amp;quot;The gains come from better reasoning quality and structure, not from verbosity,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;In terms of efficiency, SRL-trained models are roughly on par with the base model in token usage... while SRL isn’t designed to reduce inference cost, it achieves stronger reasoning performance without increasing it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the math tests, the team fine-tuned &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a dataset of 1,000 difficult math questions. They compared its performance against models trained with SFT and RLVR (using the GRPO algorithm common in models like &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DeepSeek-R1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on four competition-level math benchmarks. The SRL-trained model achieved a substantial 3.0% average performance boost over other methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team extended SRL to agentic software engineering, a domain critical for enterprise automation. They trained a coding-specialized model, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-new-ai-can-code-in-92-languages-and-its-completely-free"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on 5,000 expert trajectories of agents interacting with a coding environment. The SRL-trained model was benchmarked against the original base model and SWE-Gym-7B, a strong baseline fine-tuned with SFT. SRL achieved a 14.8% task resolve rate, representing a 74% relative improvement over the SFT-based model. This shows SRL&amp;#x27;s ability to train more competent AI agents for complex, real-world programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new standard for high-stakes AI?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper&amp;#x27;s strongest results came from combining methods: First, using SRL to teach foundational reasoning, then using RLVR to refine that skill. In their experiments, when the researchers used SRL as a pre-training and applied RLVR in post-training, they observed a 3.7% average increase, demonstrating a powerful curriculum learning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of whether this could become a new blueprint for building specialized AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We view SRL as a strong foundation,&amp;quot; Hsu said. &amp;quot;In a sense, SRL provides a curriculum — teaching models to think and act step by step — before we refine those behaviors with outcome-based reinforcement learning. This SRL-first approach not only stabilizes the later RL stage but also makes reasoning more interpretable and generalizable, which is critical for high-stakes applications.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Hsu acknowledges that scaling this pipeline still faces challenges, particularly the high cost and complexity of end-to-end RLVR for agentic tasks. However, he is optimistic about the path forward. &amp;quot;While high-quality expert trajectories remain important,&amp;quot; he concluded, &amp;quot;we think the next big leap will come from automating their generation and filtering — leveraging strong teacher models or even self-improving student models to bootstrap new data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-new-ai-training-method-helps-small-models-tackle-complex-reasoning</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Leaked documents shed light into how much OpenAI pays Microsoft (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/leaked-documents-shed-light-into-how-much-openai-pays-microsoft/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2214107176.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;After a year of frenzied dealmaking and rumors of an upcoming IPO, the financial scrutiny into OpenAI is intensifying. Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI’s financials — specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Zitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;back&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI’s models to developers and businesses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft’s net revenue share, not the gross revenue share. In other words, they don’t include whatever Microsoft paid to OpenAI from Bing and Azure OpenAI royalties. Microsoft deducts those figures from its internally reported revenue share numbers, according to this person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t break out how much it makes from Bing and Azure OpenAI in its financial statements, so it’s difficult to estimate how much the tech giant is kicking back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nevertheless, the leaked documents provide a window into the hottest company on the private markets today — and not just how much it makes in revenue, but also how much it’s spending in comparison to that revenue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, based on that widely reported 20% revenue-share statistic, we can infer that OpenAI’s revenue was at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 — but very likely to be more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Previous reports from The Information put OpenAI’s 2024 revenue at around $4 billion, and its revenue from the first half of 2025 at $4.3 billion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Altman also recently said OpenAI’s revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, will end the year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate (which is a projection, not guidance on actual revenue), and that the company could even hit $100 billion by 2027.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Per Zitron’s analysis, OpenAI may have spent roughly $3.8 billion on inference in 2024. That spend increased to roughly $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference is the compute used to run a trained AI model to generate responses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI has historically almost exclusively relied on Microsoft Azure to provide compute access, though it has also struck deals with CoreWeave and Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Previous reports put OpenAI’s entire compute spend at roughly $5.6 billion for 2024 and its “cost of revenue” at $2.5 billion for the first half of 2025.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that while OpenAI’s training spend is mostly non-cash — meaning, paid by credits Microsoft awarded OpenAI as part of its investment — the firm’s inference spend is largely cash. (Training refers to the compute resources needed to initially train a model.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While not a complete picture, these numbers imply that OpenAI could be spending&amp;nbsp;more on inference costs than it is earning in revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And those implications promise to add to the incessant AI bubble chatter that has seeped into every conversation from New York City to Silicon Valley. If model giant OpenAI really still is in the red running its models, what might this mean for the massive investments at jaw-dropping valuations for the rest of the AI world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;OpenAI declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
