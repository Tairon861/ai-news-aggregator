&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PitchBook reports that VCs have poured $192.7 billion into the industry so far this year, out of a total $366.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. In the most recent quarter, AI accounted for 62.7% of the money invested by U.S. VCs, and for 53.2% of money invested by global firms.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most of that money is going to marquee names like Anthropic, which announced a $13 billion Series F in September. Meanwhile, the number of startups and venture funds successfully raising money are at their lowest levels in years — PitchBook says that 823 funds have been raised globally so far in 2025, compared to 4,430 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PitchBook’s director of research Kyle Sanford told Bloomberg that the market is becoming “bifurcated,” where “you’re in AI, or you’re not” and “you’re a big firm, or you’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-941290532.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;New PitchBook data illustrates how dramatically AI is dominating startup investment, with 2025 on-track to become the first year when AI accounts for more than half of all VC money invested.&lt;/p&gt;
