&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday urging the Trump administration to reverse its recent decision to let Nvidia resume selling its H20 AI chips in China.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter called the Trump administration’s recent decision a “strategic misstep” that will have detrimental effects on the U.S.’s AI “edge” for both military and civilian use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter specifically called out H20’s AI inference, the process of using a trained AI model to make decisions on unseen data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The H20 is a potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip,” the letter stated. “Designed specifically to work around export control thresholds, the H20 is optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter also claimed that selling the H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the U.S.; that these chips could be used to support China’s military; and that this decision will weaken overall chip export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one,” the letter said. “We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The letter’s signatories include Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term; Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and David Feith, a former member of the National Security Council, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This letter comes two weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China again in relation to ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare earth elements. At the time, Lutnick tried to downplay the decision and said Nvidia’s H20 was the company’s “fourth best” AI chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last week, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, which highlighted the need for U.S. AI chip export restrictions but was light on the details of what those export controls would look like.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1246479507.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Not everyone is happy that the Trump administration gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its H20 advanced AI chips in China again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Samsung’s giant new Texas fab will be dedicated to making Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip,” Elon Musk posted on X late Sunday evening. “The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla’s AI6 (AKA Hardware 6) chip is the company’s bet on an all-in-one chip design that can scale from powering its driver assistance system known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots, all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Musk noted Tesla is working with TSMC to make AI5 chips, which just finished the design. The AI5, a generation that is primarily built for FSD, will initially be made in TSMC’s Taiwan factory and then at its Arizona facility.&amp;nbsp;Samsung already makes the AI4 chip, according to Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal is a boost for Samsung, which struggled to get its chip-making project off the ground after failing to attract and retain major clients. Musk said in another post that Tesla may end up spending more than $16.5 billion on Samsung chips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Actual output is likely to be several times higher,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In a later post, Musk said Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress. And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house,” Musk wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tesla switched over from Nvidia’s Drive platform to its own custom chip in 2019. That chip, known as the FSD Computer (FSDC) or Hardware 3, launched that year in all of its EVs. The FSDC, made by Samsung, consists of two duplicate systems right next to each other on one board — a design choice meant to create redundancy required for any automated driving system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since then, the company’s attention to its custom chips has expanded along with its ambitions. The AI chips are the centerpiece of Tesla’s push to move from an automaker to an AI and robotics company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2158243805.jpg?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Tesla has signed a $16.5 billion deal to get its next-generation chips from Samsung.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a digital Tower of Babel, and it’s holding back the true potential of what AI can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward, we need a common tongue; a universal translator that will allow these different systems to connect and collaborate. Several contenders have stepped up to the plate, each with their own ideas about how to solve this communication puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is one of the big names in the ring. It attempts to create a secure and organised way for AI models to use external tools and data. MCP has become popular because it’s relatively simple and has the backing of a major AI player. However, it’s really designed for a single AI to use different tools, not for a team of AIs to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s where other protocols like the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACP, an open-source project from IBM, is all about enabling AI agents to communicate as peers. It’s built on familiar web technologies that developers are already comfortable with, which makes it easy to adopt. It’s a flexible and powerful solution that allows for a more decentralised and collaborative approach to AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s A2A protocol, meanwhile, takes a slightly different tack. It’s designed to work alongside MCP, rather than replace it. A2A is focused on how a team of AIs can work together on complex tasks, passing information and responsibilities back and forth. It uses a system of ‘Agent Cards,’ like digital business cards, to help AIs find and understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real difference between these protocols is their vision for the future of how AI agents communicate. MCP is for a world where a single, powerful AI is at the centre, using a variety of tools to get things done. ACP and A2A are designed for distributed intelligence, where teams of specialised AIs work together to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal language for AI would open the door to a whole new world of possibilities. Imagine a team of AIs working together to design a new product, with one agent handling the market research, another the design, and a third the manufacturing process. Or a network of medical AIs collaborating to analyse patient data and develop personalised treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’re not there yet. The “protocol wars” are in full swing, and there’s a real risk that we could end up with even more fragmentation than we have now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the future of how AI communicates won’t be a one-size-fits-all solution. We may see different protocols, each used for what it does best.

&lt;p&gt;Porn sites may have blown up Meta's key defense in a copyright fight with book authors who earlier this year said that Meta torrented "at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries" to train its AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta has defeated most of the authors' claims and claimed there is no proof that Meta ever uploaded pirated data through seeding or leeching on the BitTorrent network used to download training data. But authors still have a chance to prove that Meta may have profited off its massive piracy, and a new lawsuit filed by adult sites last week appears to contain evidence that could help authors win their fight, TorrentFreak reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new lawsuit was filed last Friday in a US district court in California by Strike 3 Holdings—which says it attracts "over 25 million monthly visitors" to sites that serve as "ethical sources" for adult videos that "are famous for redefining adult content with Hollywood style and quality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After authors revealed Meta's torrenting, Strike 3 Holdings checked its proprietary BitTorrent-tracking tools designed to detect infringement of its videos and alleged that the company found evidence that Meta has been torrenting and seeding its copyrighted content for years—since at least 2018. Some of the IP addresses were clearly registered to Meta, while others appeared to be "hidden," and at least one was linked to a Meta employee, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta’s AI training tactics may have harmed minors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Strike 3 Holdings, Meta "willfully and intentionally" infringed "at least 2,396 movies" as part of a strategy to download terabytes of data as fast as possible by seeding popular high-quality porn. Supposedly, Meta continued seeding the content "sometimes for days, weeks, or even months" after downloading them, and these movies may also have been secretly used to train Meta's AI models, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;The porn site operator explained to the court that BitTorrent's protocol establishes a "tit-for-tat" mechanism that "rewards users who distribute the most desired content." It alleged that Meta took advantage of this system by "often" pirating adult videos that are "often within the most infringed files on BitTorrent websites" on "the very same day the motion pictures are released."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tactics allegedly gave Meta several advantages, making it harder for Strike 3 Holdings' sites to compete, including potentially distributing the videos to minors for free without age checks in states that now require them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta specifically targeted Plaintiffs’ content for distribution in order to accelerate its downloads of vast amounts of other content," the lawsuit said. And while Meta claimed that it "wrote a script to intentionally limit distributing popular books on BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings believes "discovery will likely show" Meta "continuously" distributed its adult videos specifically as a strategy to get around the BitTorrent protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Strike 3 Holdings says it has documented at least five episodes in which Meta "hand-picked" adult videos from a specific site for "intense periods of distribution" to avoid seeding other content it was sourcing through BitTorrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only reason to incur the server and bandwidth expense of remaining in a swarm for these long durations is to leverage the extended distribution as tit-for-tat currency in order to efficiently download millions of other files from BitTorrent," Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strike 3 Holdings is seeking extensive damages and an injunction to permanently stop Meta from pirating its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also wants Meta to delete any stolen videos from its AI training data and existing AI models. The company alleged that Meta could use its high-quality copyrighted works—which provide rare long cuts of "natural, human-centric imagery" showing "parts of the body not found in regular videos" and "unique" forms "of human interactions and facial expressions"—to create a rival adult video generator that could "eventually create identical content for little to no cost."&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs cannot compete against Meta when it ignores federal and state laws and offers Plaintiffs’ works for free," Strike 3 Holdings alleged. "This will effectively eliminate Plaintiffs’ future ability to compete in the marketplace" as well as its brands' "hard-earned reputations as respected and ethical sources for high-quality adult motion pictures by potentially allowing minors unfettered access to Plaintiffs’ content against Plaintiffs’ consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment on the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson told Ars, "We're reviewing the complaint, but don't believe Strike's claims are accurate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach Strike 3 Holdings' in-house lawyer, or book authors' lawyers for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidence may prove Meta seeded more content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking evidence to back its own copyright infringement claims, Strike 3 Holdings searched "its archive of recorded infringement captured by its VXN Scan and Cross Reference tools" and found 47 "IP addresses identified as owned by Facebook infringing its copyright protected Works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data allegedly demonstrates a "continued unauthorized distribution" over "several years." And Meta allegedly did not stop its seeding after Strike 3 Holdings confronted the tech giant with this evidence—despite the IP data supposedly being verified through an industry-leading provider called Maxmind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta also allegedly attempted to "conceal its BitTorrent activities" through "six Virtual Private Clouds" that formed a "stealth network" of "hidden IP addresses," the lawsuit alleged, which seemingly implicated a "major third-party data center provider" as a partner in Meta's piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of these IP addresses allegedly found "data patterns that matched infringement patterns seen on Meta’s corporate IP Addresses" and included "evidence of other activity on the BitTorrent network including ebooks, movies, television shows, music, and software." The seemingly non-human patterns documented on both sets of IP addresses suggest the data was for AI training and not for personal use, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most shockingly, considering that a Meta employee joked "torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right," Strike 3 Holdings further alleged that it found "at least one residential IP address of a Meta employee" infringing its copyrighted works. That suggests Meta may have directed an employee to torrent pirated data outside the office to obscure the data trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult site operator did not identify the employee or the major data center discussed in its complaint, noting in a subsequent filing that it recognized the risks to Meta's business and its employees' privacy of sharing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the company alleged that evidence shows "well over 100,000 unauthorized distribution transactions" linked to Meta's corporate IPs. Strike 3 Holdings is hoping the evidence will lead a jury to find Meta liable for direct copyright infringement or charge Meta with secondary and vicarious copyright infringement if the jury finds that Meta successfully distanced itself by using the third-party data center or an employee's home IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta has the right and ability to supervise and/or control its own corporate IP addresses, as well as the IP addresses hosted in off-infra data centers, and the acts of its employees and agents infringing Plaintiffs’ Works through their residential IPs by using Meta’s AI script to obtain content through BitTorrent," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs cannot compete against Meta when it ignores federal and state laws and offers Plaintiffs’ works for free," Strike 3 Holdings alleged. "This will effectively eliminate Plaintiffs’ future ability to compete in the marketplace" as well as its brands' "hard-earned reputations as respected and ethical sources for high-quality adult motion pictures by potentially allowing minors unfettered access to Plaintiffs’ content against Plaintiffs’ consent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment on the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson told Ars, "We're reviewing the complaint, but don't believe Strike's claims are accurate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars could not immediately reach Strike 3 Holdings' in-house lawyer, or book authors' lawyers for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidence may prove Meta seeded more content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking evidence to back its own copyright infringement claims, Strike 3 Holdings searched "its archive of recorded infringement captured by its VXN Scan and Cross Reference tools" and found 47 "IP addresses identified as owned by Facebook infringing its copyright protected Works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data allegedly demonstrates a "continued unauthorized distribution" over "several years." And Meta allegedly did not stop its seeding after Strike 3 Holdings confronted the tech giant with this evidence—despite the IP data supposedly being verified through an industry-leading provider called Maxmind.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta also allegedly attempted to "conceal its BitTorrent activities" through "six Virtual Private Clouds" that formed a "stealth network" of "hidden IP addresses," the lawsuit alleged, which seemingly implicated a "major third-party data center provider" as a partner in Meta's piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of these IP addresses allegedly found "data patterns that matched infringement patterns seen on Meta’s corporate IP Addresses" and included "evidence of other activity on the BitTorrent network including ebooks, movies, television shows, music, and software." The seemingly non-human patterns documented on both sets of IP addresses suggest the data was for AI training and not for personal use, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most shockingly, considering that a Meta employee joked "torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right," Strike 3 Holdings further alleged that it found "at least one residential IP address of a Meta employee" infringing its copyrighted works. That suggests Meta may have directed an employee to torrent pirated data outside the office to obscure the data trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult site operator did not identify the employee or the major data center discussed in its complaint, noting in a subsequent filing that it recognized the risks to Meta's business and its employees' privacy of sharing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the company alleged that evidence shows "well over 100,000 unauthorized distribution transactions" linked to Meta's corporate IPs. Strike 3 Holdings is hoping the evidence will lead a jury to find Meta liable for direct copyright infringement or charge Meta with secondary and vicarious copyright infringement if the jury finds that Meta successfully distanced itself by using the third-party data center or an employee's home IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Meta has the right and ability to supervise and/or control its own corporate IP addresses, as well as the IP addresses hosted in off-infra data centers, and the acts of its employees and agents infringing Plaintiffs’ Works through their residential IPs by using Meta’s AI script to obtain content through BitTorrent," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature, which is currently available only in English, will generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings, ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, and others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feature will initially be available to Chrome on the desktop. When reached for comment, Google could not confirm if or when AI summaries would come to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="an example of the store reviews feature in Google Chrome, seen inside the browser window" class="wp-image-3031554" height="802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chrome-store-summaries.png" width="1080" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google says the goal with the summaries is to provide a safer and more efficient shopping experience. However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to summarize product ratings and reviews, help customers find clothes that fit, get product recommendations and comparisons, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New AI-powered browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera Neon, and perhaps a challenger from OpenAI have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able to take control of Chrome for you to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome for Gemini subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers locate the products they’re interested in, get personalized product recommendations, and virtually try on clothes, and it has been developing tools for better price tracking, shopping in Google’s AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It all started, incongruously, with a few op-eds he wrote for TechCrunch about anti-trust enforcement in social media.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The commentaries apparently caught the attention of some folks in Washington, D.C., Liss told TechCrunch, and resulted in him being invited to guest judge a war game capstone exercise in spring 2023 hosted by the National War College. The war game was very &lt;em&gt;au courant&lt;/em&gt;, running a scenario in which the U.S. and China fought for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liss’ take away from the exercise? “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don’t have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don’t have the steel to make it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At that point, Liss said he became “really interested — obsessed, even” with the steel supply chain. “That was really the birth of Nemo Industries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The basic pitch for Nemo Industries, Liss’ latest startup, appears&amp;nbsp;as though it were drawn from a Venn diagram of two very American anxieties, steelmaking and AI. The company, until now, has been operating in stealth, but Liss gave TechCrunch a peek behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, the obvious part: Nemo will use AI to optimize the production of pig iron, modernizing an industry that Liss said is woefully outdated. “These plants are run on, at best, Excel spreadsheets. At worst, clipboard technology,” he said. The people who run them have “unbelievable expertise,” he added, but that’s the sort of thing that doesn’t scale well.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Liss isn’t pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Rather, Nemo is planning to build its own furnaces. The decision was driven by Liss’ conviction that companies that use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In steelmaking, such conviction doesn’t come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product that steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces’ carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liss’ partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1474110149.jpeg?resize=1200,985" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Daniel Liss, co-founder of the social network Dispo and the dating app Teaser AI, is convinced he’s onto the next big thing: steelmaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The decision was driven by Liss’ conviction that companies that use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In steelmaking, such conviction doesn’t come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product that steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces’ carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Liss’ partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/why-dispos-co-founder-made-the-leap-from-social-media-to-steelmaking/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:08:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Anthropic unveils new rate limits to curb Claude Code power users (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/YouTube-Thumb-Text-2-3.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic says its rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude to curb usage among subscribers who are running its AI coding tool, Claude Code, “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Anthropic says the rate limits also aim to stop a handful of users who are violating Claude’s usage policy by sharing accounts and reselling access to Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new rate limits will go into effect August 28 for subscribers to Anthropic’s $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100- and $200-per-month Max plans, the company said Monday in an email to subscribers and a post on X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;We’re rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude Pro and Max in late August. We estimate they’ll apply to less than 5% of subscribers based on current usage. pic.twitter.com/X8FAss3jIC&lt;/p&gt;— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) July 28, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic says its existing usage limits, which reset every five hours, will remain in place. The company is also introducing two new weekly rate limits that reset every seven days; one is an overall usage limit, whereas the other is specific to Anthropic’s most advanced AI model, Claude Opus 4. Anthropic says Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The announcement comes just weeks after Anthropic quietly introduced rate limits for Claude Code. The company said at the time it was aware of the issues but declined to elaborate further. While Anthropic’s AI coding tool has been a hit with developers, the company seems to be having a difficult time serving it broadly. Anthropic’s status page shows that Claude Code has experienced a partial or major outage at least seven times in the last month — perhaps because some power users seem to be running Claude Code nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch,” said Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham in an email to TechCrunch about the weekly rate limits. Rotherham notes that “most users won’t notice a difference,” and that this limit will affect less than 5% of subscribers, based on their current usage patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic tells TechCrunch that most Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 through Claude Code within their weekly rate limits. Subscribers to Anthropic’s $100-per-month Max plan can expect 140 to 280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15 to 35 hours of Opus 4. And subscribers to Anthropic’s $200-per-month Max plan can expect 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4 and 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company notes that usage may vary based on codebase size and other factors, however, it’s somewhat unclear how Anthropic is measuring usage here. Anthropic claims that the $200 Max plan offers 20x more usage than the Pro plan — but based on the updated figures, subscribers now get only about 6x as many Claude Code hours as Pro users.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s possible the 20x figure still applies when measured in tokens or compute, but the company didn’t immediately clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anthropic has said before that it’s very constrained when it comes to computational resources, which seems to be the case for most AI model providers today. Most AI companies are racing to bring new AI data centers online to meet the massive demands of serving and training their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several providers of AI coding tools are revisiting the pricing strategy around their products. In June, the company behind Cursor, Anysphere, changed the way it priced usage for its $20-per-month Pro plan to limit power users from abusing the plan. However, Anysphere later apologized for poorly communicating those changes, leading to some users paying more than they expected. Another AI coding tool provider, Replit, made similar pricing changes in June as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In an email to Claude subscribers, Anthropic says it’s committed to “supporting long-running use cases through other options in the future.” However, the company claims these rate limits will help them maintain reliable service broadly in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 4:45 p.m. PT: This story was updated to include comments from an Anthropic spokesperson and more details about Anthropic’s weekly rate limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/YouTube-Thumb-Text-2-3.png?resize=1200,675" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Anthropic says its rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude to curb usage among subscribers who are running its AI coding tool, Claude Code, “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Anthropic says the rate limits also aim to stop a handful of users who are violating Claude’s usage policy by sharing accounts and reselling access to Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It’s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with access to Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot’s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the “life story” that now accompanies so many online recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3031678" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user’s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This “agentic” use of the web is the next big leap in the AI browser race, but it’s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, Copilot does allow for voice input, which could be handy for people who aren’t as tech-savvy when it comes to booking things online, or for those who have limited mobility. (Later on, Microsoft says users will be able to give Copilot the additional context it needs, like credentials or history, to manage more advanced actions, like bookings. For now, it’s a bit more manual.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What’s more interesting, perhaps, is Copilot’s ability to be a research companion. With the user’s permission, Copilot can view all open tabs to understand what the person is browsing. This could be useful if they’re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites. Again, these are use cases for AI chatbots, but baking it into the browser could speed up the process of translating the user’s needs to the digital helper.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the future, Copilot will also prompt people to pick up where they left off on a project or something they’re researching, by recommending next steps, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company stresses that Copilot will only be able to access someone’s browsing content when they choose to allow it, and this will be made transparent to the end user with visual cues. However, the idea that you can now toggle on or off a feature that’s able to view and listen to you while you search could leave some people unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;With demand for AI-powered browsers on the rise, Microsoft on Monday launched a new feature in its Edge browser called Copilot Mode, which allows users to browse the web while being assisted by AI.

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, OpenAI's new ChatGPT Agent, which can perform multistep tasks for users, proved it can pass through one of the Internet's most common security checkpoints by clicking Cloudflare's anti-bot verification—the same checkbox that's supposed to keep automated programs like itself at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence came from Reddit, where a user named "logkn" of the r/OpenAI community posted screenshots of the AI agent effortlessly clicking through the screening step before it would otherwise present a CAPTCHA (short for "Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart") while completing a video conversion task—narrating its own process as it went.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenshots shared on Reddit capture the agent navigating a two-step verification process: first clicking the "Verify you are human" checkbox, then proceeding to click a "Convert" button after the Cloudflare challenge succeeds. The agent provides real-time narration of its actions, stating "The link is inserted, so now I'll click the 'Verify you are human' checkbox to complete the verification on Cloudflare. This step is necessary to prove I'm not a bot and proceed with the action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absurdity of an AI agent declaring it needs to prove it's "not a bot" while clicking through anti-bot measures has not been lost on observers. "In all fairness, it’s been trained on human data why would it identify as a bot? We should respect that choice," joked one Reddit user in a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;The CAPTCHA arms race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the agent didn't face an actual CAPTCHA puzzle with images in this case, successfully passing Cloudflare's behavioral screening that determines whether to present such challenges demonstrates sophisticated browser automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of this capability, it's important to know that CAPTCHA systems have served as a security measure on the web for decades. Computer researchers invented the technique in the 1990s to screen bots from entering information into websites, originally using images with letters and numbers written in wiggly fonts, often obscured with lines or noise to foil computer vision algorithms. The assumption is that the task will be easy for humans but difficult for machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's screening system, called Turnstile, often precedes actual CAPTCHA challenges and represents one of the most widely deployed bot-detection methods today. The checkbox analyzes multiple signals, including mouse movements, click timing, browser fingerprints, IP reputation, and JavaScript execution patterns to determine if the user exhibits human-like behavior. If these checks pass, users proceed without seeing a CAPTCHA puzzle. If the system detects suspicious patterns, it escalates to visual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability for an AI model to defeat a CAPTCHA isn't entirely new (although having one narrate the process feels fairly novel). AI tools have been able to defeat certain CAPTCHAs for a while, which has led to an arms race between those that create them and those that defeat them. OpenAI's Operator, an experimental web-browsing AI agent launched in January, faced difficulty clicking through some CAPTCHAs (and was also trained to stop and ask a human to complete them), but the latest ChatGPT Agent tool has seen a much wider release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to say that the ability of AI agents to pass these tests puts the future effectiveness of CAPTCHAs into question, but for as long as there have been CAPTCHAs, there have been bots that could later defeat them. As a result, recent CAPTCHAs have become more of a way to slow down bot attacks or make them more expensive rather than a way to defeat them entirely. Some malefactors even hire out farms of humans to defeat them in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHAs also have unexpected benefits for those who run them. Since 2007, the reCAPTCHA project began using its tests as a form of free labor for tasks like digitizing books and training machine-learning algorithms. Google acquired reCAPTCHA in 2009 and expanded its use to decode Google Street View addresses, extracting vision knowledge from human users solving challenges. Today's reCAPTCHA challenges help Google train AI models for image recognition—creating an ironic cycle where humans proving they're not robots are actually helping to make AI better at defeating future CAPTCHAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, that future may have arrived. ChatGPT Agent's demonstration showcases the agent tool's ability to process visual context and navigate multi-step processes that would typically require human judgment. In the screenshots, the agent recognizes when verification is needed and completes it as part of a larger workflow—behavior that goes beyond simple scripted automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHAs are just one example of the complex tasks ChatGPT Agent can handle. For example, another Reddit user showed off a photo of a load of groceries that Agent apparently purchased. "I had agent mode order me some groceries from a local supermarket while I worked yesterday for pickup this morning," the Reddit user wrote. "It actually worked without any issue and did an okay job making a grocery list that works for me. I gave it barely any detail in my instructions other than to avoid red meat, prioritize health and keep it under $150."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT Agent isn't perfect. Some terrible website user interfaces are apparently better than CAPTCHA checkpoints at foiling the new bot. "Your agent did way better than mine," wrote one Reddit reply. "Mine couldn’t figure out how to get to the stop and shop website."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, that future may have arrived. ChatGPT Agent's demonstration showcases the agent tool's ability to process visual context and navigate multi-step processes that would typically require human judgment. In the screenshots, the agent recognizes when verification is needed and completes it as part of a larger workflow—behavior that goes beyond simple scripted automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPTCHAs are just one example of the complex tasks ChatGPT Agent can handle. For example, another Reddit user showed off a photo of a load of groceries that Agent apparently purchased. "I had agent mode order me some groceries from a local supermarket while I worked yesterday for pickup this morning," the Reddit user wrote. "It actually worked without any issue and did an okay job making a grocery list that works for me. I gave it barely any detail in my instructions other than to avoid red meat, prioritize health and keep it under $150."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT Agent isn't perfect. Some terrible website user interfaces are apparently better than CAPTCHA checkpoints at foiling the new bot. "Your agent did way better than mine," wrote one Reddit reply. "Mine couldn’t figure out how to get to the stop and shop website."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;

          &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next front in Donald Trump's trade war will be chip tariffs—which could come by next month—but national security experts are warning that the president may have already made a huge misstep that threatens to disrupt both US trade and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter Monday to Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, 20 policymakers and professionals with a background in national security policy urged Trump to reverse course and block exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, the Trump administration decided against imposing additional export curbs on H20 chips after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang paid $1 million for a seat at a Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR reported. Apparently, Nvidia's promise to invest $500 billion in AI data centers helped persuade Trump to change course, as did the terms of a temporary truce with China, in which the US promised to halt H20 chip controls in exchange for China restoring imports of rare earth minerals into the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their letter, national security experts expressed "deep concern" that Trump may not have considered how Nvidia's H20 chips could endanger the US military's "edge in artificial intelligence" while serving as a "potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these chips can't be used for AI training like the Blackwell and H100 chips still restricted by export curbs, they're "optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models," experts warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, China will use the chips for AI models deployed by its military to "enable autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and rapid advances in battlefield decision-making," experts said. In that way, "by supplying China with these chips, we are fueling the very infrastructure that will be used to modernize and expand the Chinese military," they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is notably investigating how chip tariffs and imports could harm national security, with a report due out in two weeks, Lutnick announced today. That report will supposedly help Trump determine if relying too much on other countries for chips poses a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;But experts seem to fear that Trump isn't paying enough attention to how exports of US technology could threaten to not only supercharge China's military and AI capabilities but also drain supplies that US firms need to keep the US at the forefront of AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More chips for China means fewer chips for the US," experts said, noting that "China’s biggest tech firms, including Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba," have spent $16 billion on bulk-ordered H20 chips over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, "projected data center demand from the US power market would require 90 percent of global chip supply through 2030, an unlikely scenario even without China joining the rush to buy advanced AI chips," experts said. If Trump doesn't intervene, one of America's biggest AI rivals could even end up driving up costs of AI chips for US firms, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urge you to reverse course," the letter concluded. "This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump says he never heard of Nvidia before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger problem for Trump, national security experts suggest, would be if China or other trade partners perceive the US resolve to wield export controls as a foreign policy tool to be "weakened" by Trump reversing course on H20 controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested that Trump caving on H20 controls could even "embolden China to seek additional access concessions" at a time when some analysts suggest that China may already have an upper hand in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China are largely expected to extend a 90-day truce following recent talks in Stockholm, Reuters reported. Anonymous sources told the South China Morning Post that the US may have already agreed to not impose any new tariffs or otherwise ratchet up the trade war during that truce, but that remains unconfirmed, as Trump continues to warn that chip tariffs are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently claimed that he thinks he may be close to cementing a deal with China, but it appears likely that talks will continue well into the fall. A meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping probably won't be scheduled until late October or early November, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Trump, appearing weak on export controls could give China leverage. China's sticking point in negotiations is seemingly that the US is trying to stunt its growth through the trade war, Reuters noted. And a recent editorial in the People's Daily, "the mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party" insisted that China remains "firmly opposed to any attempt to undermine the multilateral trading system through unilateralism and protectionism" like US export curbs, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Trump already backed down from export curbs once, experts fear he may never revive the H20 curbs, possibly choosing to prioritize closing a potential trade deal with China over safeguarding national security. If other countries perceive that "tension"—that Trump will sacrifice national security priorities for trade war wins—it could result in more unfavorable outcomes, heightening national security risks in Trump's other trade deals, experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For national security experts, it seems the time has come to scrutinize just how much Trump knows about AI or else risk "a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge" in AI—"an area increasingly seen as decisive in 21st-century global leadership."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their doubts about Trump's understanding of the AI industry may be warranted, given an eyebrow-raising admission Trump made while unveiling his AI Action Plan last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech, Trump confessed that he had threatened to break up Nvidia before he even knew what one of the world's most valuable AI companies even did, Tom's Hardware reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Nvidia's Huang an "amazing" AI industry leader, Trump said he made the threat "before I learned the facts of life"—basically that a breakup would be "very hard" since Nvidia has somewhere between 70 to 95 percent of the market share for AI chips. Since Trump campaigned on using tariffs to strong-arm tech companies into diverting manufacturing into the US—partly to win the AI race—it seems surprising that he wouldn't be aware of the leading AI chip firm that depends heavily on both US and Chinese markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I said, 'What the hell is Nvidia?' I've never heard of it before," Trump said just days ago. "I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit, get them a little competition, and I found it's not easy in that business."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But experts seem to fear that Trump isn't paying enough attention to how exports of US technology could threaten to not only supercharge China's military and AI capabilities but also drain supplies that US firms need to keep the US at the forefront of AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More chips for China means fewer chips for the US," experts said, noting that "China’s biggest tech firms, including Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba," have spent $16 billion on bulk-ordered H20 chips over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, "projected data center demand from the US power market would require 90 percent of global chip supply through 2030, an unlikely scenario even without China joining the rush to buy advanced AI chips," experts said. If Trump doesn't intervene, one of America's biggest AI rivals could even end up driving up costs of AI chips for US firms, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urge you to reverse course," the letter concluded. "This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump says he never heard of Nvidia before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger problem for Trump, national security experts suggest, would be if China or other trade partners perceive the US resolve to wield export controls as a foreign policy tool to be "weakened" by Trump reversing course on H20 controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested that Trump caving on H20 controls could even "embolden China to seek additional access concessions" at a time when some analysts suggest that China may already have an upper hand in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China are largely expected to extend a 90-day truce following recent talks in Stockholm, Reuters reported. Anonymous sources told the South China Morning Post that the US may have already agreed to not impose any new tariffs or otherwise ratchet up the trade war during that truce, but that remains unconfirmed, as Trump continues to warn that chip tariffs are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently claimed that he thinks he may be close to cementing a deal with China, but it appears likely that talks will continue well into the fall. A meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping probably won't be scheduled until late October or early November, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;
        
                  &lt;div class="ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;
            &lt;div class="ad ad--mid-content"&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
          
    
    &lt;div class="mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0"&gt;
      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;For Trump, appearing weak on export controls could give China leverage. China's sticking point in negotiations is seemingly that the US is trying to stunt its growth through the trade war, Reuters noted. And a recent editorial in the People's Daily, "the mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party" insisted that China remains "firmly opposed to any attempt to undermine the multilateral trading system through unilateralism and protectionism" like US export curbs, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Trump already backed down from export curbs once, experts fear he may never revive the H20 curbs, possibly choosing to prioritize closing a potential trade deal with China over safeguarding national security. If other countries perceive that "tension"—that Trump will sacrifice national security priorities for trade war wins—it could result in more unfavorable outcomes, heightening national security risks in Trump's other trade deals, experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For national security experts, it seems the time has come to scrutinize just how much Trump knows about AI or else risk "a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge" in AI—"an area increasingly seen as decisive in 21st-century global leadership."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their doubts about Trump's understanding of the AI industry may be warranted, given an eyebrow-raising admission Trump made while unveiling his AI Action Plan last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech, Trump confessed that he had threatened to break up Nvidia before he even knew what one of the world's most valuable AI companies even did, Tom's Hardware reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Nvidia's Huang an "amazing" AI industry leader, Trump said he made the threat "before I learned the facts of life"—basically that a breakup would be "very hard" since Nvidia has somewhere between 70 to 95 percent of the market share for AI chips. Since Trump campaigned on using tariffs to strong-arm tech companies into diverting manufacturing into the US—partly to win the AI race—it seems surprising that he wouldn't be aware of the leading AI chip firm that depends heavily on both US and Chinese markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I said, 'What the hell is Nvidia?' I've never heard of it before," Trump said just days ago. "I figured we could go in and we could sort of break them up a little bit, get them a little competition, and I found it's not easy in that business."&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  
          &lt;div class="-mx-2.5 sm:mx-0"&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic announced today it would introduce weekly rate limits for Claude subscribers, claiming that some users have been running Claude 24/7, with the majority of usage centered around its Claude Code product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall weekly limits will begin on August 28 and will be in conjunction with the current 5-hour limits. Anthropic said the throttling will only affect 5% of its total users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, many developers and other users reacted negatively to the news, claiming that the move unfairly punishes more people for the actions of a few.&amp;nbsp;The move also raises the question of how enterprises hoping to run more long-running projects could reach their usage limits much faster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch. We designed our plans to give developers generous access to Claude, and while most users operate within normal patterns, we’ve also seen policy violations like account sharing and reselling access, which affects performance for everyone,” Anthropic said in a statement sent to VentureBeat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added in an email sent to Claude subscribers that it also noticed “advanced usage patterns like running Claude 24/7 in the background that are impacting system capacity for all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic added that it continues to support “long running use cases through other options in the future, but until then, weekly limits will help us maintain reliable service for everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-new-rate-limits"&gt;The new rate limits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic did not specify what the rate limits are, but said most Claude Max 20x users “can expect 240-480 hours of Sonnet 4 and 24-40 hours of Opus 4 within their weekly rate limits.” Heavy users of the Opus model or those who run multiple instances of Claude Code simultaneously can reach these limits sooner. The company insisted that “most users won’t notice any difference, the weekly limits are designed to support typical daily use across your projects.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For users that do hit the weekly usage limit, they can buy more usage “at standard API rates to continue working without interruption.” Many enterprises may already have an agreement with Anthropic around rate limits, but some organizations may be using one of the subscription tiers with Claude. This could mean companies needing to buy more usage access to run some projects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The additional rate limits come as users experienced reliability issues with Claude, which Anthropic acknowledged. The company stated that it is working on addressing any remaining issues over the next few days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has been making waves in the developer community, even helping push for the ubiquity of AI coding tools. In June, the company transformed the Claude AI assistant into a no-code platform for all users and launched a financial services-specific version of Claude for the Enterprise tier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rate limits exist to ensure that model providers and chat platforms have the bandwidth to respond to user prompts. Although some companies, such as Google, have slowly removed limits for specific models, others, including OpenAI and Anthropic, offer different tiers of rate limits to their users. The idea is that power users will pay more for the compute power they need, while users who use these platforms less will not have to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, rate limits may limit the use cases people can perform, especially for those experimenting with long-running agents or working on larger coding projects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-backlash-already"&gt;Backlash already&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understandably, many paying Claude users found the decision to throttle their usage limits distasteful, decrying that Anthropic is penalizing power users for the actions of a few who are abusing the system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this launch, the company aims to broaden access to Aristotle, which Harmonic claims to offer “hallucination-free” answers for questions involving mathematical reasoning — a bold claim given the reliability problems of today’s AI models. Harmonic is focused on creating “mathematical superintelligence” or MSI; the startup eventually wants to help users with all fields that rely on math, including physics, statistics, and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“[Aristotle] is the first product available to people that does reasoning and formally verifies the output,” said Harmonic CEO and co-founder Tudor Achim in an interview with TechCrunch. “Within the domains that Aristotle supports, which are quantitative reasoning domains, we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Eventually, Harmonic says it also plans to release an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Harmonic says Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO) through a formal test (meaning the problems were translated into a machine‑readable format). Google and OpenAI also developed AI models that achieved gold medal performance on this year’s IMO, but through informal tests taken in natural language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Harmonic says it’s not releasing other benchmarks for Aristotle at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The beta launch of Aristotle comes just a few weeks since Harmonic raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins at an $875 million valuation. Achim claims that Harmonic is “advancing very rapidly along” its path to achieving MSI and that investors believed that was a fair valuation given the scope of his startup’s ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several leading tech companies are focused on training their AI models to solve math problems. AI that can do math is valuable in its own right, but math is also considered a uniquely verifiable domain that demands core reasoning skills. Systems that develop these capabilities may prove useful in other domains as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Achim says that Harmonic achieves its hyper-accurate solutions by having Aristotle produce responses in the open source programming language Lean. Before Aristotle gives an answer to users, he says the model double-checks that the solution is correct through an algorithmic process that doesn’t involve AI. Harmonic’s CEO notes that similar technology is used to verify outputs in high-stakes fields such as medical devices and aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even in a narrow domain, achieving hallucination-free performance from an AI model is an incredibly difficult task. Studies have found that even leading AI models hallucinate a lot, and the problem doesn’t appear to be getting better.

&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably, OpenAI’s goal is to keep users inside GPT-like interfaces as long as possible. A dedicated browser would allow the company to directly integrate products such as Operator, which handles repetitive browser tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latter, ultimately, is the future of AI-powered search, experts say: Agents that fetch information for users and get to know their habits, interests and goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re moving into an era where the browser doesn’t just respond, it anticipates,” said Duane. “The future of search is not about finding, it’s about fulfilling.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-current-gen-ai-powered-search-landscape-nbsp"&gt;The current gen AI-powered search landscape&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever OpenAI enters the gen AI-powered search space, it will face a slate of competition, including from Perplexity, Dia, Arc, Andi, Bagoodex, Komo You.com and others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, Perplexity’s Comet was launched earlier this month, but is currently only available to customers on the $200-per-month tier. The company says it will roll out the browser to additional users on an invite-only basis, and eventually make it free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perplexity is “excellent for deep research,” noted Wyatt Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting, but its current price tag gears it toward power users, not the mass market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perplexity is “fast, task-oriented” and being increasingly adopted in knowledge work, noted Johnny Hughes, co-founder and CMO at marketing and advertising firm Avenue Z. “The issue? Source transparency and trust are still hit or miss,” he said. You.com, Arc and others also have good user interface (UI) experimentation, but “lack scale, funding or core differentiators.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dia, meanwhile, as Mayham put it, is “rethinking the browser from scratch with modular AI features, but faces the uphill battle of adoption in a space dominated by incumbents.” And, its intent-sensitive automation is also more constrained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incumbents have also taken steps to compete. Chrome has introduced AI Mode and Bing offers Copilot search, while Firefox, DuckDuckGo and others have incorporated AI chatbots and sidebars, as well as integrated AI summaries into search results. Still, these are more conservative and remain closer to traditional assistive search, and are beholden to ad revenue models and legacy UX.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-potential-advantage-in-search"&gt;OpenAI’s potential advantage in search&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What could set ChatGPT apart from the others is its strong market share, deep industry partnerships — and the fact that it has 500 million weekly active users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say one advantage is its task-oriented nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of giving you a list of links, their upcoming browser agent aims to complete actions (book a flight, order groceries, handle forms),” said Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting. “That’s a different model than Google’s ad-driven approach and has major implications for how discovery happens online.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is indeed a “big shift in mental models,” agreed Hughes of Avenue Z. Google was built to index and rank, while OpenAI is engineered to understand, synthesize and serve intent-based outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re not trying to ‘crawl the web,’ they’re trying to comprehend it,” he said, emphasizing that today’s users are searching for direct answers, not just links.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s advantage over rivals is its massive developer ecosystem, built-in user behavior via ChatGPT and direct feedback loops from billions of prompts. Where Perplexity functions as a powerful agentic assistant, and Gemini augments search with context and extensions, “OpenAI is positioned to become the OS layer of the internet,” said Hughes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-can-openai-really-topple-google-nbsp"&gt;But can OpenAI really topple Google?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The browser wars have been ongoing for years, and Chrome remains the far-and-away dominant player.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to marketing intelligence firm Datos, the tech giant maintained a 90.15% share of the U.S. user base and 92.49% in Europe between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. By contrast, ChatGPT accounted for just 0.29% of desktop events in the U.S. and 0.32% in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Short of a miracle, I have a hard time seeing any new browser having any kind of material impact on Google’s browser dominance for quite some time, if at all,” said Eli Goodman, Datos’ CEO and co-founder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI tools will show value in areas including summarization, research acceleration and “mitigating tab fatigue,” he said. “But an existential threat to Google? Not yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For AI browsers to truly disrupt the market, they’ll need to prove that their end-to-end experience is not just faster or smarter, but consistently more useful than what users already know, he noted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is strong at answering well-formed questions using its internal knowledge and language reasoning, but it lacks access to real-time, long-tail and less-indexed web content, said Vladyslav Hamolia, AI product lead at Mac app builder MacPaw.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is where a traditional browser-plus-search engine still plays a key role, surfacing newly published pages, live prices, event-specific updates or in-depth technical documentation,” said Hamolia. “The browser is not just a UI layer; it’s a gateway to navigating and filtering a vast, dynamic web that models alone cannot fully absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google remains dominant in crawling depth (with two decades of crawling infrastructure), semantic understanding of web structure (sitemaps, structured data) and personalized relevance, he noted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, pointed out that Chrome users also likely use Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and other Google platforms. “OpenAI and Perplexity don’t have that same gamut of services.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if their AI agents can begin replacing more Google tools beyond search, they can win some market share.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We also have to consider what strategy OpenAI and Perplexity take with their browsers,” said Jackson. “Right now, Perplexity makes Comet available only for its paying users, so at the moment, it’s more of an added value to draw in subscribers rather than trying to win browser market share.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ai-web-browsers"&gt;Advantages and disadvantages of AI web browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advantages of AI search may not be truly seen for some time, said Info-Tech’s Jackson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Comet touts its ability to summarize and translate every page instantly, that’s not so different from what can be accomplished with Chrome — especially once you consider its extensive library of available extensions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These AI browsers will literally be trying to interpret the goal of users,” he said. “They will make suggestions, offer to automate routine tasks, find product comparisons or source multiple quotes for services. “Browsers could transition from being mere windows to web content to agentic assistants that help users achieve their digital goals.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, resistance to new technology is always a factor, he pointed out. Users who reject the AI summaries they see in core search will likely also reject the notion that AI should be at the forefront of browsing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The early days of user experience will be important here, and if we see browsers recommending that users put glue on pizza or other silly things like that, it won’t help with adoption,” said Jackson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another distinguishing factor with AI search is models’ ability to persist memory across sessions and assist with task execution in-browser.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The risk, however, is user trust,” said Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president at fractional CMO agency RiseOpp. “A browser that thinks and remembers raises legitimate privacy concerns unless boundaries are clearly defined.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving from static search bars to dynamic AI interfaces that learn, adapt and integrate with internal systems also introduces new exposure points, especially when proprietary data is surfaced by models operating across public and private content, he noted. Enterprises must be prepared to revisit access controls and ensure AI agents align with governance and compliance standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These tools are converging in functionality but diverging in user control,” said Vahdat. “The key differentiator may not be capability, but how well each platform balances autonomy with transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-enterprises-should-do-now"&gt;What enterprises should do now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether sooner or later, how should enterprises prepare for a new search environment where SEO is no longer relevant?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think of your site as a reference point for AI systems, advised Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting. Content should be clear, factual and structured so AI tools can easily surface information. Also, prepare for conversational commerce by ensuring product data and checkout flows are API-friendly and that AI agents can complete transactions without friction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, invest in brand authority; if AI cites sources, it’ll use a brand name, not just keywords. “Brand trust is critical,” said Mayham, and is achieved by being featured on other authoritative websites or reviewed well on review platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises should stop thinking in blue links and start building content that answers, reasons and resonates,” agreed Avenue Z’s Hughes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring content with AI comprehension in mind (schema, embeddings, FAQs)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Prioritizing expert-driven, evergreen content that large language models (LLMs) trust&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diversifying beyond Google (social search, TikTok SEO, YouTube, voice)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Training internal teams on prompt engineering and AI integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is critical to make the customer experience interoperable with agentic AI, emphasized Brown University’s Duane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Soon, users won’t be browsing; they’ll be delegating,” she said. “You need to prepare your systems not just to be found, but to be understood by AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re moving into an era where the browser doesn’t just respond, it anticipates,” said Duane. “The future of search is not about finding, it’s about fulfilling.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-current-gen-ai-powered-search-landscape-nbsp"&gt;The current gen AI-powered search landscape&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever OpenAI enters the gen AI-powered search space, it will face a slate of competition, including from Perplexity, Dia, Arc, Andi, Bagoodex, Komo You.com and others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, Perplexity’s Comet was launched earlier this month, but is currently only available to customers on the $200-per-month tier. The company says it will roll out the browser to additional users on an invite-only basis, and eventually make it free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perplexity is “excellent for deep research,” noted Wyatt Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting, but its current price tag gears it toward power users, not the mass market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perplexity is “fast, task-oriented” and being increasingly adopted in knowledge work, noted Johnny Hughes, co-founder and CMO at marketing and advertising firm Avenue Z. “The issue? Source transparency and trust are still hit or miss,” he said. You.com, Arc and others also have good user interface (UI) experimentation, but “lack scale, funding or core differentiators.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dia, meanwhile, as Mayham put it, is “rethinking the browser from scratch with modular AI features, but faces the uphill battle of adoption in a space dominated by incumbents.” And, its intent-sensitive automation is also more constrained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incumbents have also taken steps to compete. Chrome has introduced AI Mode and Bing offers Copilot search, while Firefox, DuckDuckGo and others have incorporated AI chatbots and sidebars, as well as integrated AI summaries into search results. Still, these are more conservative and remain closer to traditional assistive search, and are beholden to ad revenue models and legacy UX.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-potential-advantage-in-search"&gt;OpenAI’s potential advantage in search&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What could set ChatGPT apart from the others is its strong market share, deep industry partnerships — and the fact that it has 500 million weekly active users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say one advantage is its task-oriented nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of giving you a list of links, their upcoming browser agent aims to complete actions (book a flight, order groceries, handle forms),” said Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting. “That’s a different model than Google’s ad-driven approach and has major implications for how discovery happens online.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is indeed a “big shift in mental models,” agreed Hughes of Avenue Z. Google was built to index and rank, while OpenAI is engineered to understand, synthesize and serve intent-based outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re not trying to ‘crawl the web,’ they’re trying to comprehend it,” he said, emphasizing that today’s users are searching for direct answers, not just links.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s advantage over rivals is its massive developer ecosystem, built-in user behavior via ChatGPT and direct feedback loops from billions of prompts. Where Perplexity functions as a powerful agentic assistant, and Gemini augments search with context and extensions, “OpenAI is positioned to become the OS layer of the internet,” said Hughes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-can-openai-really-topple-google-nbsp"&gt;But can OpenAI really topple Google?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The browser wars have been ongoing for years, and Chrome remains the far-and-away dominant player.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to marketing intelligence firm Datos, the tech giant maintained a 90.15% share of the U.S. user base and 92.49% in Europe between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. By contrast, ChatGPT accounted for just 0.29% of desktop events in the U.S. and 0.32% in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Short of a miracle, I have a hard time seeing any new browser having any kind of material impact on Google’s browser dominance for quite some time, if at all,” said Eli Goodman, Datos’ CEO and co-founder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI tools will show value in areas including summarization, research acceleration and “mitigating tab fatigue,” he said. “But an existential threat to Google? Not yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For AI browsers to truly disrupt the market, they’ll need to prove that their end-to-end experience is not just faster or smarter, but consistently more useful than what users already know, he noted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is strong at answering well-formed questions using its internal knowledge and language reasoning, but it lacks access to real-time, long-tail and less-indexed web content, said Vladyslav Hamolia, AI product lead at Mac app builder MacPaw.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is where a traditional browser-plus-search engine still plays a key role, surfacing newly published pages, live prices, event-specific updates or in-depth technical documentation,” said Hamolia. “The browser is not just a UI layer; it’s a gateway to navigating and filtering a vast, dynamic web that models alone cannot fully absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google remains dominant in crawling depth (with two decades of crawling infrastructure), semantic understanding of web structure (sitemaps, structured data) and personalized relevance, he noted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, pointed out that Chrome users also likely use Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and other Google platforms. “OpenAI and Perplexity don’t have that same gamut of services.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if their AI agents can begin replacing more Google tools beyond search, they can win some market share.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We also have to consider what strategy OpenAI and Perplexity take with their browsers,” said Jackson. “Right now, Perplexity makes Comet available only for its paying users, so at the moment, it’s more of an added value to draw in subscribers rather than trying to win browser market share.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ai-web-browsers"&gt;Advantages and disadvantages of AI web browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advantages of AI search may not be truly seen for some time, said Info-Tech’s Jackson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Comet touts its ability to summarize and translate every page instantly, that’s not so different from what can be accomplished with Chrome — especially once you consider its extensive library of available extensions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These AI browsers will literally be trying to interpret the goal of users,” he said. “They will make suggestions, offer to automate routine tasks, find product comparisons or source multiple quotes for services. “Browsers could transition from being mere windows to web content to agentic assistants that help users achieve their digital goals.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, resistance to new technology is always a factor, he pointed out. Users who reject the AI summaries they see in core search will likely also reject the notion that AI should be at the forefront of browsing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The early days of user experience will be important here, and if we see browsers recommending that users put glue on pizza or other silly things like that, it won’t help with adoption,” said Jackson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another distinguishing factor with AI search is models’ ability to persist memory across sessions and assist with task execution in-browser.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The risk, however, is user trust,” said Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president at fractional CMO agency RiseOpp. “A browser that thinks and remembers raises legitimate privacy concerns unless boundaries are clearly defined.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving from static search bars to dynamic AI interfaces that learn, adapt and integrate with internal systems also introduces new exposure points, especially when proprietary data is surfaced by models operating across public and private content, he noted. Enterprises must be prepared to revisit access controls and ensure AI agents align with governance and compliance standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These tools are converging in functionality but diverging in user control,” said Vahdat. “The key differentiator may not be capability, but how well each platform balances autonomy with transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-enterprises-should-do-now"&gt;What enterprises should do now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether sooner or later, how should enterprises prepare for a new search environment where SEO is no longer relevant?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think of your site as a reference point for AI systems, advised Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting. Content should be clear, factual and structured so AI tools can easily surface information. Also, prepare for conversational commerce by ensuring product data and checkout flows are API-friendly and that AI agents can complete transactions without friction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, invest in brand authority; if AI cites sources, it’ll use a brand name, not just keywords. “Brand trust is critical,” said Mayham, and is achieved by being featured on other authoritative websites or reviewed well on review platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises should stop thinking in blue links and start building content that answers, reasons and resonates,” agreed Avenue Z’s Hughes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring content with AI comprehension in mind (schema, embeddings, FAQs)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Prioritizing expert-driven, evergreen content that large language models (LLMs) trust&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diversifying beyond Google (social search, TikTok SEO, YouTube, voice)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Training internal teams on prompt engineering and AI integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is critical to make the customer experience interoperable with agentic AI, emphasized Brown University’s Duane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Soon, users won’t be browsing; they’ll be delegating,” she said. “You need to prepare your systems not just to be found, but to be understood by AI.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its lighter-weight sibling, GLM-4.5-Air, also performs within the top six, offering strong results relative to its smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both models feature dual operation modes: a thinking mode for complex reasoning and tool use, and a non-thinking mode for instant response scenarios. They can a&lt;strong&gt;utomatically generate complete PowerPoint presentations from a single title or prompt,&lt;/strong&gt; making them useful for meeting preparation, education, and internal reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They further offer creative writing, emotionally aware copywriting, and script generation to create branded content for social media and the web. Moreover, z.ai says they support virtual character development and turn-based dialogue systems for customer support, roleplaying, fan engagement, or digital persona storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both models support reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities, GLM-4.5-Air is designed for teams seeking a lighter-weight, more cost-efficient alternative with faster inference and lower resource requirements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai also lists several specialized models in the GLM-4.5 family on its API, including &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-X&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-AirX&lt;/strong&gt; for ultra-fast inference, and &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Flash&lt;/strong&gt;, a free variant optimized for coding and reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’re available now to use directly on Z.ai and through the Z.ai application programming interface (API) for developers to connect to third-party apps, and their code is available on HuggingFace and ModelScope. The company also provides multiple integration routes, including support for inference via vLLM and SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-licensing-and-api-pricing"&gt;Licensing and API pricing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are released under the &lt;strong&gt;Apache 2.0 license&lt;/strong&gt;, a permissive and commercially friendly open-source license. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows developers and organizations to freely &lt;strong&gt;use, modify, self-host, fine-tune, and redistribute&lt;/strong&gt; the models for both research and commercial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t want to download the model code or weights and self-host or deploy on their own, z.ai’s cloud-based API offers the model for the following prices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.60&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;$2.20 per 1 million input/output tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Air&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.20 /&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;$1.10 per 1M input/output tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A CNBC article on the models reported that z.ai would charge only $0.11 / $0.28 per million input/output tokens, which is also supported by a Chinese graphic the company posted on its API documentation for the “Air model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014808" height="289" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/benchmark2-1.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this appears to be the case only for inputting up to 32,000 tokens and outputting 200 tokens at a single time. (Recall tokens are the numerical designations the LLM uses to represent different semantic concepts and word components, the LLM’s native language, with each token translating to a word or portion of a word). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Chinese graphic reveals far more detailed pricing for both models per batches of tokens inputted/outputted. I’ve tried to translate it below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014815" height="315" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/glm-4-5-table-2.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another note: since z.ai is based in China, those in the West who are focused on data sovereignty will want to due diligence through internal policies to pursue using the API, as it may be subject to Chinese content restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competitive-performance-on-third-party-benchmarks-approaching-that-of-leading-closed-proprietary-llms"&gt;Competitive performance on third-party benchmarks, approaching that of leading closed/proprietary LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014793" height="549" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bench.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 ranks third across 12 industry benchmarks measuring agentic, reasoning, and coding performance—trailing only OpenAI’s GPT-4 and xAI’s Grok 4. GLM-4.5-Air, its more compact sibling, lands in sixth position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In agentic evaluations, GLM-4.5 matches Claude 4 Sonnet in performance and exceeds Claude 4 Opus in web-based tasks. It achieves a 26.4% accuracy on the BrowseComp benchmark, compared to Claude 4 Opus’s 18.8%. In the reasoning category, it scores competitively on tasks such as MATH 500 (98.2%), AIME24 (91.0%), and GPQA (79.1%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For coding, GLM-4.5 posts a 64.2% success rate on SWE-bench Verified and 37.5% on Terminal-Bench. In pairwise comparisons, it outperforms Qwen3-Coder with an 80.8% win rate and beats Kimi K2 in 53.9% of tasks. Its agentic coding ability is enhanced by integration with tools like Claude Code, Roo Code, and CodeGeex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model also leads in tool-calling reliability, with a success rate of 90.6%, edging out Claude 4 Sonnet and the new-ish Kimi K2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-part-of-the-wave-of-open-source-chinese-llms"&gt;Part of the wave of open source Chinese LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release of GLM-4.5 arrives amid a surge of competitive open-source model launches in China, most notably from &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba’s Qwen Team&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the span of a single week, Qwen released &lt;strong&gt;four new open-source LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;, including the reasoning-focused &lt;strong&gt;Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507&lt;/strong&gt;, which now tops or matches leading models such as OpenAI’s o4-mini and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro on reasoning benchmarks like AIME25, LiveCodeBench, and GPQA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Alibaba continued the trend with the release of Wan 2.2, a powerful new open source video model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s new models are, like z.ai, licensed under &lt;strong&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing commercial usage, self-hosting, and integration into proprietary systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The broad availability and permissive licensing of Alibaba’s offerings and Chinese startup Moonshot before it with its Kimi K2 model reflects an ongoing strategic effort by Chinese AI companies to position open-source infrastructure as a viable alternative to closed U.S.-based models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also places pressure on the U.S.-based model provider efforts to compete in open source. Meta has been on a hiring spree after its Llama 4 model family debuted earlier this year to a mixed response from the AI community, including a hefty dose of criticism for what some AI power users saw as benchmark gaming and inconsistent performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman recently announced that OpenAI’s long-awaited and much-hyped frontier open source LLM — its first since before ChatGPT launched in late 2022 — would be delayed from its originally planned July release to an as-yet unspecified later date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-architecture-and-training-lessons-revealed"&gt;Architecture and training lessons revealed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 is built with 355 billion total and 32 billion active parameters. Its counterpart, GLM-4.5-Air, offers a lighter-weight design at 106 billion total and 12 billion active parameters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, optimized with loss-free balance routing, sigmoid gating, and increased depth for enhanced reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The self-attention block includes Grouped-Query Attention and a higher number of attention heads. A Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) layer enables speculative decoding during inference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pre-training spans 22 trillion tokens split between general-purpose and code/reasoning corpora. Mid-training adds 1.1 trillion tokens from repo-level code data, synthetic reasoning inputs, and long-context/agentic sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai’s post-training process for GLM-4.5 relied upon a reinforcement learning phase powered by its in-house RL infrastructure, &lt;em&gt;slime&lt;/em&gt;, which separates data generation and model training processes to optimize throughput on agentic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the techniques they used were mixed-precision rollouts and adaptive curriculum learning.&lt;br /&gt;The former help the model train faster and more efficiently by using lower-precision math when generating data, without sacrificing much accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, adaptive curriculum learning means the model starts with easier tasks and gradually moves to harder ones, helping it learn more complex tasks gradually over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5’s architecture prioritizes computational efficiency. According to CNBC, Z.ai CEO &lt;strong&gt;Zhang Peng&lt;/strong&gt; stated that the model runs on just eight &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia H20 GPUs&lt;/strong&gt; — custom silicon designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. That’s roughly half the hardware requirement of DeepSeek’s comparable models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interactive-demos"&gt;Interactive demos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai highlights full-stack development, slide creation, and interactive artifact generation as demonstration areas on its blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examples include a Flappy Bird clone, Pokémon Pokédex web app, and slide decks built from structured documents or web queries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014798" height="600" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-6.22.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=754" width="754" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can interact with these features on the Z.ai chat platform or through API integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-company-background-and-market-position"&gt;Company background and market position&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai was founded in 2019 under the name Zhipu, and has since grown into one of China’s most prominent AI startups, according to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has raised over $1.5 billion from investors including Alibaba, Tencent, Qiming Venture Partners, and municipal funds from Hangzhou and Chengdu, with additional backing from Aramco-linked Prosperity7 Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its GLM-4.5 launch coincides with the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, where multiple Chinese firms showcased advancements. Z.ai was also named in a June OpenAI report highlighting Chinese progress in AI, and has since been added to a U.S. entity list limiting business with American firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-means-for-enterprise-technical-decision-makers"&gt;What it means for enterprise technical decision-makers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For senior AI engineers, data engineers, and AI orchestration leads tasked with building, deploying, or scaling language models in production, the GLM-4.5 family’s release under the &lt;strong&gt;Apache 2.0 license&lt;/strong&gt; presents a meaningful shift in options. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model offers performance that rivals top proprietary systems across reasoning, coding, and agentic benchmarks — yet comes with full weight access, commercial usage rights, and flexible deployment paths, including cloud, private, or on-prem environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those managing LLM lifecycles — whether leading model fine-tuning, orchestrating multi-stage pipelines, or integrating models with internal tools — GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air reduce barriers to testing and scaling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The models support standard OpenAI-style interfaces and tool-calling formats, making it easier to evaluate in sandboxed environments or drop into existing agent frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 also supports &lt;strong&gt;streaming output, context caching, and structured JSON responses&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling smoother integration with enterprise systems and real-time interfaces. For teams building autonomous tools, its deep thinking mode provides more precise control over multi-step reasoning behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For teams under budget constraints or those seeking to avoid vendor lock-in, the pricing structure undercuts major proprietary alternatives like DeepSeek and Kimi K2. This matters for organizations where usage volume, long-context tasks, or data sensitivity make open deployment a strategic necessity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For professionals in AI infrastructure and orchestration, such as those implementing CI/CD pipelines, monitoring models in production, or managing GPU clusters, GLM-4.5’s support for vLLM, SGLang, and mixed-precision inference aligns with current best practices in efficient, scalable model serving. Combined with open-source RL infrastructure (slime) and a modular training stack, the model’s design offers flexibility for tuning or extending in domain-specific environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, GLM-4.5’s launch gives enterprise teams a viable, high-performing foundation model they can &lt;strong&gt;control, adapt, and scale&lt;/strong&gt;, without being tied to proprietary APIs or pricing structures. It’s a compelling option for teams balancing innovation, performance, and operational constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:shortcode --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Another week in the summer of 2025 has begun, and in a continuation of the trend from last week, with it arrives more powerful Chinese open source AI models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little-known (at least to us here in the West) Chinese startup Z.ai has introduced two new open source LLMs — &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Air&lt;/strong&gt; — casting them as go-to solutions for AI reasoning, agentic behavior, and coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to Z.ai’s blog post, the models perform near the top of the pack of other proprietary LLM leaders in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the flagship GLM-4.5 matches or outperforms leading proprietary models like &lt;strong&gt;Claude 4 Sonnet&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Claude 4 Opus&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong&gt; on evaluations such as &lt;strong&gt;BrowseComp&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AIME24&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;SWE-bench Verified&lt;/strong&gt;, while ranking third overall across a dozen competitive tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="id"&gt;&lt;div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-speedbump" id="boilerplate_2803147"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its lighter-weight sibling, GLM-4.5-Air, also performs within the top six, offering strong results relative to its smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both models feature dual operation modes: a thinking mode for complex reasoning and tool use, and a non-thinking mode for instant response scenarios. They can a&lt;strong&gt;utomatically generate complete PowerPoint presentations from a single title or prompt,&lt;/strong&gt; making them useful for meeting preparation, education, and internal reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They further offer creative writing, emotionally aware copywriting, and script generation to create branded content for social media and the web. Moreover, z.ai says they support virtual character development and turn-based dialogue systems for customer support, roleplaying, fan engagement, or digital persona storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both models support reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities, GLM-4.5-Air is designed for teams seeking a lighter-weight, more cost-efficient alternative with faster inference and lower resource requirements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai also lists several specialized models in the GLM-4.5 family on its API, including &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-X&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-AirX&lt;/strong&gt; for ultra-fast inference, and &lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Flash&lt;/strong&gt;, a free variant optimized for coding and reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’re available now to use directly on Z.ai and through the Z.ai application programming interface (API) for developers to connect to third-party apps, and their code is available on HuggingFace and ModelScope. The company also provides multiple integration routes, including support for inference via vLLM and SGLang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-licensing-and-api-pricing"&gt;Licensing and API pricing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are released under the &lt;strong&gt;Apache 2.0 license&lt;/strong&gt;, a permissive and commercially friendly open-source license. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows developers and organizations to freely &lt;strong&gt;use, modify, self-host, fine-tune, and redistribute&lt;/strong&gt; the models for both research and commercial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t want to download the model code or weights and self-host or deploy on their own, z.ai’s cloud-based API offers the model for the following prices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.60&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;$2.20 per 1 million input/output tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLM-4.5-Air&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$0.20 /&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;$1.10 per 1M input/output tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A CNBC article on the models reported that z.ai would charge only $0.11 / $0.28 per million input/output tokens, which is also supported by a Chinese graphic the company posted on its API documentation for the “Air model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014808" height="289" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/benchmark2-1.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this appears to be the case only for inputting up to 32,000 tokens and outputting 200 tokens at a single time. (Recall tokens are the numerical designations the LLM uses to represent different semantic concepts and word components, the LLM’s native language, with each token translating to a word or portion of a word). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Chinese graphic reveals far more detailed pricing for both models per batches of tokens inputted/outputted. I’ve tried to translate it below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014815" height="315" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/glm-4-5-table-2.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another note: since z.ai is based in China, those in the West who are focused on data sovereignty will want to due diligence through internal policies to pursue using the API, as it may be subject to Chinese content restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competitive-performance-on-third-party-benchmarks-approaching-that-of-leading-closed-proprietary-llms"&gt;Competitive performance on third-party benchmarks, approaching that of leading closed/proprietary LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014793" height="549" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bench.png?w=800" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 ranks third across 12 industry benchmarks measuring agentic, reasoning, and coding performance—trailing only OpenAI’s GPT-4 and xAI’s Grok 4. GLM-4.5-Air, its more compact sibling, lands in sixth position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In agentic evaluations, GLM-4.5 matches Claude 4 Sonnet in performance and exceeds Claude 4 Opus in web-based tasks. It achieves a 26.4% accuracy on the BrowseComp benchmark, compared to Claude 4 Opus’s 18.8%. In the reasoning category, it scores competitively on tasks such as MATH 500 (98.2%), AIME24 (91.0%), and GPQA (79.1%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For coding, GLM-4.5 posts a 64.2% success rate on SWE-bench Verified and 37.5% on Terminal-Bench. In pairwise comparisons, it outperforms Qwen3-Coder with an 80.8% win rate and beats Kimi K2 in 53.9% of tasks. Its agentic coding ability is enhanced by integration with tools like Claude Code, Roo Code, and CodeGeex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model also leads in tool-calling reliability, with a success rate of 90.6%, edging out Claude 4 Sonnet and the new-ish Kimi K2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-part-of-the-wave-of-open-source-chinese-llms"&gt;Part of the wave of open source Chinese LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release of GLM-4.5 arrives amid a surge of competitive open-source model launches in China, most notably from &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba’s Qwen Team&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the span of a single week, Qwen released &lt;strong&gt;four new open-source LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;, including the reasoning-focused &lt;strong&gt;Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507&lt;/strong&gt;, which now tops or matches leading models such as OpenAI’s o4-mini and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro on reasoning benchmarks like AIME25, LiveCodeBench, and GPQA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Alibaba continued the trend with the release of Wan 2.2, a powerful new open source video model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s new models are, like z.ai, licensed under &lt;strong&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing commercial usage, self-hosting, and integration into proprietary systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The broad availability and permissive licensing of Alibaba’s offerings and Chinese startup Moonshot before it with its Kimi K2 model reflects an ongoing strategic effort by Chinese AI companies to position open-source infrastructure as a viable alternative to closed U.S.-based models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also places pressure on the U.S.-based model provider efforts to compete in open source. Meta has been on a hiring spree after its Llama 4 model family debuted earlier this year to a mixed response from the AI community, including a hefty dose of criticism for what some AI power users saw as benchmark gaming and inconsistent performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman recently announced that OpenAI’s long-awaited and much-hyped frontier open source LLM — its first since before ChatGPT launched in late 2022 — would be delayed from its originally planned July release to an as-yet unspecified later date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-architecture-and-training-lessons-revealed"&gt;Architecture and training lessons revealed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5 is built with 355 billion total and 32 billion active parameters. Its counterpart, GLM-4.5-Air, offers a lighter-weight design at 106 billion total and 12 billion active parameters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, optimized with loss-free balance routing, sigmoid gating, and increased depth for enhanced reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The self-attention block includes Grouped-Query Attention and a higher number of attention heads. A Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) layer enables speculative decoding during inference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pre-training spans 22 trillion tokens split between general-purpose and code/reasoning corpora. Mid-training adds 1.1 trillion tokens from repo-level code data, synthetic reasoning inputs, and long-context/agentic sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai’s post-training process for GLM-4.5 relied upon a reinforcement learning phase powered by its in-house RL infrastructure, &lt;em&gt;slime&lt;/em&gt;, which separates data generation and model training processes to optimize throughput on agentic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the techniques they used were mixed-precision rollouts and adaptive curriculum learning.&lt;br /&gt;The former help the model train faster and more efficiently by using lower-precision math when generating data, without sacrificing much accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, adaptive curriculum learning means the model starts with easier tasks and gradually moves to harder ones, helping it learn more complex tasks gradually over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLM-4.5’s architecture prioritizes computational efficiency. According to CNBC, Z.ai CEO &lt;strong&gt;Zhang Peng&lt;/strong&gt; stated that the model runs on just eight &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia H20 GPUs&lt;/strong&gt; — custom silicon designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. That’s roughly half the hardware requirement of DeepSeek’s comparable models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interactive-demos"&gt;Interactive demos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai highlights full-stack development, slide creation, and interactive artifact generation as demonstration areas on its blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examples include a Flappy Bird clone, Pokémon Pokédex web app, and slide decks built from structured documents or web queries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3014798" height="600" src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-6.22.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=754" width="754" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users can interact with these features on the Z.ai chat platform or through API integration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-company-background-and-market-position"&gt;Company background and market position&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Z.ai was founded in 2019 under the name Zhipu, and has since grown into one of China’s most prominent AI startups, according to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has raised over $1.5 billion from investors including Alibaba, Tencent, Qiming Venture Partners, and municipal funds from Hangzhou and Chengdu, with additional backing from Aramco-linked Prosperity7 Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its GLM-4.5 launch coincides with the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, where multiple Chinese firms showcased advancements. Z.ai was also named in a June OpenAI report highlighting Chinese progress in AI, and has since been added to a U.S. entity list limiting business with American firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-means-for-enterprise-technical-decision-makers"&gt;What it means for enterprise technical decision-makers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Horizon VC, 8VC, Y Combinator, the AI Grant accelerator participated in the round along with several high-profile angel investors, including Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson, among others. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Founder Rahul Sonwalkar launched Julius after graduating from Y Combinator in 2022, and pivoting away from the logistics startup he’d been building during the accelerator program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Julius is designed to act like a data scientist by analyzing and visualizing extensive datasets and then performing predictive modeling from natural language prompts. Even with functionality similar to that found in ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, Julius has carved out its own niche. The company said it has more than two million users and generates more than 10 million visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,” Julius AI founder Rahul Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “You can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human would go, run the code and do the analysis for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: “Can you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Julius’ specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course called&amp;nbsp;Data Science and AI for Leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People told us you’re not going to succeed,” Sonwalkar said about building a product that’s similar to features available from the foundational model companies. &amp;nbsp;“What we found was that being focused on a use case is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While going through YC, Sonwalkar also masterminded a viral prank. The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside of the company’s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer “Rahul Ligma.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Somwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t think many people know me for that anymore,” he told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “I get recognized for Julius a lot more now.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rahul-Headshot-rotated.jpeg?resize=800,1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Julius AI, a startup that describes itself as an AI data analyst, announced it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,” Julius AI founder Rahul Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “You can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human would go, run the code and do the analysis for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Questions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: “Can you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Julius’ specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course called&amp;nbsp;Data Science and AI for Leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“People told us you’re not going to succeed,” Sonwalkar said about building a product that’s similar to features available from the foundational model companies. &amp;nbsp;“What we found was that being focused on a use case is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While going through YC, Sonwalkar also masterminded a viral prank. The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside of the company’s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer “Rahul Ligma.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Despite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Somwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t think many people know me for that anymore,” he told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “I get recognized for Julius a lot more now.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/ai-data-analyst-startup-julius-nabs-10m-seed-round/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:42:48 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
