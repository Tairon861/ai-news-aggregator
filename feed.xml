The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won’t allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won’t be barred from the service.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta’s rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn’t ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp’s Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn’t any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn’t able to charge them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Green-white-apple-logo.jpg?resize=1200,900" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Meta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform.

This new app fakes your summer vacation photos for you (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/too-burned-out-to-travel-this-new-app-fakes-your-summer-vacation-photos-for-you/</link><description>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;At a time when startup hustle culture is back, when “locked in” tech founders have even embraced the “996” way of working — 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week — there is something dystopian about using an AI app to generate fake vacation photos of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And yet, here we are. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Product designer Laurent Del Rey, who recently joined Meta’s Superintelligence Lab, launched a side project called Endless Summer, a photobooth app for iPhone that creates AI-generated vacation photos starring you in locations around the world. Here you are exploring a beach town, or overlooking a European city from your balcony. There you are, out shopping, having dinner with friends, or at a social gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It doesn’t look like anyone in these photos is talking about AI or entrepreneurship or a lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Del Rey explained when sharing the launch on X, the new app is for when “burnout hits and you need to manifest the soft life u deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(When you can’t live life, you may as well fake it, right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;made this little photobooth app called endless summer for when burnout hits and you need to manifest the soft life u deserve – with fake vacation pics of you :')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;first app 100% made by me! just released it on the app store try it out &amp;lt;33 pic.twitter.com/i55nRcE71V&lt;/p&gt;— saint laurent del rey (@laurentdelrey) October 6, 2025&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The product designer told TechCrunch that he was inspired to create the app because summer is his favorite season, and he loves how life feels during that time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-cta__wrapper"&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Techcrunch event&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="inline-cta__content"&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
									&lt;span class="inline-cta__location"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__separator"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
													&lt;span class="inline-cta__date"&gt;October 27-29, 2025&lt;/span&gt;
							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As the season ends, I wanted to make something that felt like that. It’s from that feeling that I reverse-engineered the product experience,” he says. “I created an Xcode project and started iterating directly from there, sculpting the code experience, so to speak.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The experience he landed on was a simple user interface where there’s a tiny camera preview button at the bottom of the screen. You tap the button to make an AI-generated “summer” photo. As you click, the photos appear on your screen, in a sort of camera roll-style view. Each photo features you, or rather an AI version of you, exploring the world and looking fairly content while doing so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Behind the scenes, Gemini’s Nano-Banana image-model is doing the heavy lifting, as the app prompts the model for different variations of the summer photo output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3058942" height="465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-17-at-4.51.16PM.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The app isn’t saving your selfies, Del Rey says, unless you have its optional auto-generation mode enabled. Plus, users can delete their account at any time with just two taps, which erases everything.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Nano-Banana is relatively cheap, it does cost money. For that reason, you can’t generate unlimited photos for free with Endless Summer. Instead, you’ll hit a paywall after your first six images, with a prompt suggesting payment options even before then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The pricing isn’t too bad if you’re looking to just dabble with the personalized AI imagery out of curiosity — or because you’re lamenting having missed your summer vacay this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s $3.99 to make 30 images, $17.99 for 150, and $34.99 for 300. You can enable or disable a “Room Service” mode that auto-delivers two photos to you every morning, featuring your latest summer escapades and world travels. You can also set your gender in the app or leave it to guess (“Auto” mode), and turn on or off an option that auto-saves the AI images to your iPhone’s Camera Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A recent option in the app lets you generate Halloween photos instead of summer photos, featuring you in different costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The photos themselves have a vintage film aesthetic, which makes them look like the casual lifestyle pics they’re supposed to resemble. That brings a sense of nostalgia to the app, as it evokes a mid-2000s feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This reflects other modern trends around online photo sharing. Whether that’s adopting retro technology, like zoomers carrying disposable cameras, or posting Instagram photo dumps of blurry pics, there’s a desire among some for a less-curated, less “technically perfect” version of life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;How bizarre is it that it’s AI bringing that to you now? &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;At a time when startup hustle culture is back, when “locked in” tech founders have even embraced the “996” way of working — 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week — there is something dystopian about using an AI app to generate fake vacation photos of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to a new blog post from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Why is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has disputed the claim that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Miller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it paused the effort after editors complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable, reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For that reason, he argues that AI, search, and social companies using content from Wikipedia “must encourage more visitors” to the website itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And he says Wikipedia is taking steps of its own, for example by developing a new framework&amp;nbsp;for attributing content from the encyclopedia. The organization also has two teams tasked with helping Wikipedia reach new readers, and it’s looking for volunteers to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Miller also encourages readers to “support content integrity and content creation” more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you search for information online, look for citations and click through to the original source material,” he writes. “Talk with the people you know about the importance of trusted, human curated knowledge, and help them understand that the content underlying generative AI was created by real people who deserve their support.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1873370000.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Wikipedia is often described as the last good website on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to a new blog post from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Why is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has disputed the claim that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Miller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it paused the effort after editors complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable, reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference on Friday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For that reason, he argues that AI, search, and social companies using content from Wikipedia “must encourage more visitors” to the website itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And he says Wikipedia is taking steps of its own, for example by developing a new framework&amp;nbsp;for attributing content from the encyclopedia. The organization also has two teams tasked with helping Wikipedia reach new readers, and it’s looking for volunteers to help.&lt;/p&gt;
