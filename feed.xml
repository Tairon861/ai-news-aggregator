New research from NTT DATA outlines a playbook that shows how these “AI leaders” set themselves apart through strong plans, firm decisions, and a disciplined approach to building and using AI across their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a survey of 2,567 senior executives in 35 countries and 15 industries. Only 15% of the organisations met the bar to be considered AI leaders. These companies share a few traits: clear direction on where AI fits into their business, a solid operating model, and consistent follow-through. They also reported higher revenue growth and stronger profit margins than everyone else in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yutaka Sasaki, President and CEO of NTT DATA Group, put it simply: “AI accountability now belongs in the boardroom and demands an enterprise-wide agenda. Our research shows that a small group of AI leaders already are using AI to differentiate, grow and reinvent how humans and machines create value together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-playbook-behind-strong-ai-plans"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The playbook behind strong AI plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest differences between leaders and the rest is how they approach strategy. For these companies, AI is not a side project or a tool bolted onto existing work. They treat it as a core driver of growth and adjust their plans to match that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major advantage for these leaders is how closely they connect AI with their business goals. This alignment helps them move faster and stay focused, which in turn delivers stronger financial outcomes. They also zero in on a few high-value areas of the business rather than spreading resources too thin. By redesigning entire workflows around AI, they unlock more value than if they had only made small improvements in scattered parts of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report describes this as a kind of flywheel: early investments bring early wins, which then encourage more investment. Over time, this cycle becomes self-reinforcing. Leaders also rebuild important applications with AI embedded inside them, instead of adding basic AI features on top of old systems. This approach helps them see deeper impact and prepares the organisation for long-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-leaders-put-their-plans-to-work"&gt;How leaders put their plans to work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good plan only works when backed by strong execution. AI leaders stand out through the foundations they build, the way they support their people, and how they drive adoption across the entire organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies invest in secure and scalable systems that can support large AI workloads. In some cases, they shift or localise their infrastructure to support private or sovereign AI needs. They also work to remove system bottlenecks so teams can move without roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than using AI as a replacement for workers, leaders use it to help experienced employees do higher-value work. This “expert-first” approach allows teams to use their judgment while letting AI handle complex or time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI leaders also focus on adoption as a long-term change effort. They treat it as a company-wide shift, supported by clear communication and structured change management. This helps reduce pushback and encourages steady use of AI at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance is another major difference. Leading organisations centralise their AI oversight, give clear responsibility to senior roles such as Chief AI Officers, and build processes that help balance innovation with risk. These systems allow them to scale AI more confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnerships also play a major role. Top companies often bring in outside experts and are open to arrangements that tie outcomes to shared success. This helps them move faster while keeping their goals in view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhijit Dubey, CEO and CAIO of NTT DATA, Inc., summarised the path forward: “Once AI and business strategies are aligned, the single most effective move is to pick one or two domains that deliver disproportionate value and redesign them end-to-end with AI. Supporting this focused, end-to-end approach with strong governance, modern infrastructure and trusted partners is how today’s AI leaders are turning pilots into profit and pulling ahead of the market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Igor Omilaev)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: OpenAI: Enterprise users swap AI pilots for deep integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111234" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-4.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it’s the “only technologically feasible solution” to climate change, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley’s simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It’s a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials—and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They’re also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“They’ve ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,” says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. “I think it’s going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company’s first extensive interviews with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it’s appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,” he says. “But it could be much worse. We’re saying we’d better be ready.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not for us to decide, and I’ll say humbly, it’s not for these researchers to decide,” he adds. “It’s the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The building blocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company’s lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel’s secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1129080" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yanai-Amyad-Stardust-Labs-and-Offices-pic-9.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Stardust CEO Yanai Yedvab (right) and Chief Product Officer Amyad Spector (left) at the company's facility in Israel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ROBY YAHAV, STARDUST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Maybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm&amp;nbsp; cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company’s earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Essentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere—for a fee—by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Stardust is serious, and now it’s raised serious money from serious people—all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,” says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. “We’re in a more dangerous era now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results “to ensure there’s no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,” MacMartin says. “[It] shouldn’t be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He criticized, for instance, the company’s claims to have developed&amp;nbsp;what he described as their&amp;nbsp;“magic aerosol particle,” arguing that the assertion that it is perfectly safe and inert can’t be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn’t be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world’s nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in “a fair, inclusive, and effective manner.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Solar geoengineering is not necessary,” the authors wrote. “Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The for-profit decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it’s important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world’s ability to respond to it, requiring a new “class of solution … that buys us time and protects us from overheating.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered “most of the groundbreaking technologies” in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they’ve done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,” the company said in a follow-up email. “Eventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we’re confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no way this field could move forward if you don’t have this governance framework, if you don’t have external validation, if you don’t have clear regulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they’re favorable or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence “substantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,” he says, “so that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn’t a “silver bullet” but said it is “the only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions—which is what we see as our role,” the company added later. “We are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ambitious projections&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust’s earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first “stratospheric aerial experiments” last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a “large-scale demonstration” around 2030 and proceed to a “global full-scale deployment” by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We won’t have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies—and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust’s materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of &lt;em&gt;After Geoengineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,” Buck wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She says the timelines are also “unrealistic” because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust’s for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,” she says. “We actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you’d turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?” asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. “Should global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today’s reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revised plans&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust’s strategy at a “very early stage in our work,” adding that their thinking has “evolved,” partly in response to consultations with experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, “That’s a necessary but not sufficient condition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Governments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,” he says. “It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to move forward.’ It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to wait a few years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for them to make these decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported last year. It’s also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn’t conducted outdoor particle experiments and won’t move forward with them until it has approval from governments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,” he says. “There is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.” But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, “should be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Generating returns &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there’s no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could “drive the timelines,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that raises a different set of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,” she says. “There’s a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that’s the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust has “quietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill” and has hired the law firm Holland &amp;amp; Knight, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop “strategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,” according to a case study on the company’s&amp;nbsp; website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,” Red Duke states. “This effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Red Duke didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it’s not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it’s making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we speak to policymakers—and we speak to policymakers; we don’t hide it—essentially, what we tell them is ‘Listen, there is a solution,’” he says. “‘It’s not decades away—it’s a few years away. And it’s your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Any solution needs checks and balances,” he says. “This is how we see the checks and balances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,” he says. “We’ll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says the company’s investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust’s work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Sentiment of hope’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2020 novel, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ministry for the Future&lt;/em&gt;, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, &lt;em&gt;Geoengineering: The Gamble&lt;/em&gt;, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We understand that probably it will not be perfect,” Yedvab says. “We understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,” he adds.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects&amp;nbsp; nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it’s the “only technologically feasible solution” to climate change, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley’s simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It’s a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials—and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They’re also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“They’ve ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,” says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. “I think it’s going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company’s first extensive interviews with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it’s appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,” he says. “But it could be much worse. We’re saying we’d better be ready.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not for us to decide, and I’ll say humbly, it’s not for these researchers to decide,” he adds. “It’s the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The building blocks&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company’s lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel’s secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1129080" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yanai-Amyad-Stardust-Labs-and-Offices-pic-9.jpg?w=2048" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Stardust CEO Yanai Yedvab (right) and Chief Product Officer Amyad Spector (left) at the company's facility in Israel. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;ROBY YAHAV, STARDUST&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;“Maybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm&amp;nbsp; cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company’s earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Essentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere—for a fee—by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Stardust is serious, and now it’s raised serious money from serious people—all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“That marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,” says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. “We’re in a more dangerous era now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__container--08c53dd3bc9bd04e1e42e5f7ca641ab2"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__header--19f7f372f181cc6d4c06bc7362a44382"&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__title--4af28c786a2bc93df05db111c6c30618"&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__askAi--577f5fe6f54de43e37258d0f2aff4394"&gt;Ask AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__whyItMattersTitle--a3694998bb578e159bbd16690b8da390"&gt;Why it matters to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="whyItMatters__betaBadge--9e84228b864d33d5b55479433fc91b8a"&gt;BETA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__description--e1334886c092fa469388d7a24e1e1a55"&gt;&lt;span class="initial-description"&gt;Here’s why this story might matter to you, according to AI. This is a beta feature and AI hallucinates—it might get weird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="whyItMatters__questionContainer--ec1159210954852b9178c549600959a0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class="whyItMatters__actionButton--674934b6df433ac81e613372979cdb6c" type="button"&gt;Tell me why it matters&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_8"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results “to ensure there’s no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,” MacMartin says. “[It] shouldn’t be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He criticized, for instance, the company’s claims to have developed&amp;nbsp;what he described as their&amp;nbsp;“magic aerosol particle,” arguing that the assertion that it is perfectly safe and inert can’t be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn’t be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world’s nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in “a fair, inclusive, and effective manner.”&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“Solar geoengineering is not necessary,” the authors wrote. “Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The for-profit decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust says it’s important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world’s ability to respond to it, requiring a new “class of solution … that buys us time and protects us from overheating.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered “most of the groundbreaking technologies” in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they’ve done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_12"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,” the company said in a follow-up email. “Eventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we’re confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no way this field could move forward if you don’t have this governance framework, if you don’t have external validation, if you don’t have clear regulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they’re favorable or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_14"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence “substantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,” he says, “so that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn’t a “silver bullet” but said it is “the only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions—which is what we see as our role,” the company added later. “We are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ambitious projections&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust’s earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first “stratospheric aerial experiments” last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a “large-scale demonstration” around 2030 and proceed to a “global full-scale deployment” by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We won’t have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies—and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust’s materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of &lt;em&gt;After Geoengineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,” Buck wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She says the timelines are also “unrealistic” because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_18"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust’s for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,” she says. “We actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_20"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you’d turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“What if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?” asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. “Should global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today’s reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revised plans&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust’s strategy at a “very early stage in our work,” adding that their thinking has “evolved,” partly in response to consultations with experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, “That’s a necessary but not sufficient condition.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Governments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,” he says. “It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to move forward.’ It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to wait a few years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for them to make these decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported last year. It’s also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn’t conducted outdoor particle experiments and won’t move forward with them until it has approval from governments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_22"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,” he says. “There is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.” But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, “should be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Generating returns &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there’s no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could “drive the timelines,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that raises a different set of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,” she says. “There’s a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that’s the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stardust has “quietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill” and has hired the law firm Holland &amp;amp; Knight, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop “strategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,” according to a case study on the company’s&amp;nbsp; website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_24"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,” Red Duke states. “This effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Red Duke didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it’s not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it’s making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“When we speak to policymakers—and we speak to policymakers; we don’t hide it—essentially, what we tell them is ‘Listen, there is a solution,’” he says. “‘It’s not decades away—it’s a few years away. And it’s your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.’”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Any solution needs checks and balances,” he says. “This is how we see the checks and balances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_26"&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,” he says. “We’ll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He says the company’s investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust’s work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_28"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowercarbon Capital didn’t respond to an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Sentiment of hope’&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2020 novel, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ministry for the Future&lt;/em&gt;, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, &lt;em&gt;Geoengineering: The Gamble&lt;/em&gt;, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We understand that probably it will not be perfect,” Yedvab says. “We understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“I think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,” he adds.&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1129079/how-one-controversial-startup-hopes-to-cool-the-planet/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Securing VMware workloads in regulated industries (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1128475/securing-vmware-workloads-in-regulated-industries/</link><description>&lt;section class="sponsoredModule__wrapper--c8f6fcf4edb2dcd3a940a2824bb850dc sponsoredModule__minimalist--f63b84a37007076f51d0ebb0dc1af42f"&gt;&lt;p class="sponsoredModule__intro--e69c514244f1e38617e4ec5ea754fb7f"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In partnership with&lt;/span&gt;RapidScale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="image__wrapper--373a87c0cefdc42b3a8bd26457571412"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background opacity"&gt;&lt;span class="image__img--e1a73f503bf0f4a3d2504e1d64ea29cb imgLazyLoaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a regional hospital, a cardiac patient’s lab results sit behind layers of encryption, accessible to his surgeon but shielded from those without strictly need-to-know status.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as a reasoning engine, “agents” act as the hands, capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows with minimal supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, visibility into how these tools are actually being utilised in the wild has been opaque, relying largely on speculative frameworks or limited surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data released by Perplexity, analysing hundreds of millions of interactions with its Comet browser and assistant, provides a first large-scale field study of general-purpose AI agents. The data indicates that agentic AI is already being deployed by high-value knowledge workers to streamline productivity and research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding who is using these tools is essential for forecasting internal demand and identifying potential shadow IT vectors. The study reveals marked heterogeneity in adoption. Users in nations with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment are far more likely to engage with agentic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More telling for corporate planning is the occupational breakdown. Adoption is heavily concentrated in digital and knowledge-intensive sectors. The ‘Digital Technology’ cluster represents the largest share, accounting for 28 percent of adopters and 30 percent of queries. This is followed closely by academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these clusters account for over 70 percent of total adopters. This suggests that the individuals most likely to leverage agentic workflows are the most expensive assets within an organisation: software engineers, financial analysts, and market strategists. These early adopters are not dabbling; the data shows that “power users” (those with earlier access) make nine times as many agentic queries as average users, indicating that once integrated into a workflow, the technology becomes indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-agents-partners-for-enterprise-tasks-not-butlers"&gt;AI agents: Partners for enterprise tasks, not butlers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To advance beyond marketing narratives, enterprises must understand the utility these agents provide. A common view suggests agents will primarily function as “digital concierges” for rote administrative chores. However, the data challenges this view: 57 percent of all agent activity focuses on cognitive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s researchers developed a “hierarchical agentic taxonomy” to classify user intent, revealing the usage of AI agents is practical rather than experimental. The dominant use case is ‘Productivity &amp;amp; Workflow,’ which accounts for 36 percent of all agentic queries. This is followed by ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research’ at 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific anecdotes from the study illustrate how this translates to enterprise value. A procurement professional, for instance, used the assistant to scan customer case studies and identify relevant use cases before engaging with a vendor. Similarly, a finance worker delegated the tasks of filtering stock options and analysing investment information. In these scenarios, the agent handles the information gathering and initial synthesis autonomously to allow the human to focus on final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distribution provides a definite indication to operational leaders: the immediate ROI for agentic AI lies in scaling human capability rather than simply automating low-level friction. The study defines these agents as systems that “cycle automatically between three iterative phases to achieve the end goal: thinking, acting, and observing.” This capability allows them to support “deep cognitive work,” acting as a thinking partner rather than a simple butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stickiness-and-the-cognitive-migration"&gt;Stickiness and the cognitive migration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key insight for IT leaders is the “stickiness” of AI agents for enterprise workflows. The data shows that in the short term, users exhibit strong within-topic persistence. If a user engages an agent for a productivity task, their subsequent queries are highly likely to remain in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the user journey often evolves. New users frequently “test the waters” with low-stakes queries, such as asking for movie recommendations or general trivia. Over time, a transition occurs. The study notes that while users may enter via various use cases, query shares tend to migrate toward cognitively oriented domains like productivity, learning, and career development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a user employs an agent to debug code or summarise a financial report, they rarely revert to lower-value tasks. The ‘Productivity’ and ‘Workflow’ categories demonstrate the highest retention rates. This behaviour implies that early pilot programmes should anticipate a learning curve where usage matures from simple information retrieval to complex task delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “where” of agentic AI is just as important as the “what”. Perplexity’s study tracked the environments – specific websites and platforms – where these AI agents operate. The concentration of activity varies by task, but the top environments are staples of the modern enterprise stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is a primary environment for document and spreadsheet editing, while LinkedIn dominates professional networking tasks. For ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research,’ the activity is split between course platforms like Coursera and research repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and compliance officers, this presents a new risk profile. AI agents are not just reading data; they are actively manipulating it within core enterprise applications. The study explicitly defines agentic queries as those involving “browser control” or actions on external applications via APIs. When an employee tasks an agent to “summarise these customer case studies,” the agent is interacting directly with proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of environments also highlights the potential for platform-specific optimisations. For instance, the top five environments account for 96 percent of queries in professional networking, primarily on LinkedIn. This high concentration suggests that businesses could see immediate efficiency gains by developing specific governance policies or API connectors for these high-traffic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-planning-for-agentic-ai-following-perplexity-s-data"&gt;Business planning for agentic AI following Perplexity’s data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of capable AI agents invites new lines of inquiry for business planning. The data from Perplexity confirms that we have passed the speculative phase. Agents are currently being used to plan and execute multi-step actions, modifying their environments rather than just exchanging information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational leaders should consider three immediate actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the productivity and workflow &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friction points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; within high-value teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The data shows this is where agents are naturally finding their foothold. If software engineers and financial analysts are already using these tools to edit documents or manage accounts, formalising these workflows could standardise efficiency gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the augmentation reality: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers note that while agents have autonomy, users often break tasks into smaller pieces, delegating only subtasks. This suggests that the immediate future of work is collaborative, requiring employees to be upskilled in how to effectively “manage” their AI counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address the infrastructure and security layer:&lt;/strong&gt; With agents operating in “open-world web environments” and interacting with sites like GitHub and corporate email, the perimeter for data loss prevention expands. Policies must distinguish between a chatbot offering advice and an agent executing code or sending messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market for agentic AI is projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to $199 billion by 2034, the early evidence from Perplexity serves as a bellwether.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as a reasoning engine, “agents” act as the hands, capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows with minimal supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, visibility into how these tools are actually being utilised in the wild has been opaque, relying largely on speculative frameworks or limited surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data released by Perplexity, analysing hundreds of millions of interactions with its Comet browser and assistant, provides a first large-scale field study of general-purpose AI agents. The data indicates that agentic AI is already being deployed by high-value knowledge workers to streamline productivity and research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding who is using these tools is essential for forecasting internal demand and identifying potential shadow IT vectors. The study reveals marked heterogeneity in adoption. Users in nations with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment are far more likely to engage with agentic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More telling for corporate planning is the occupational breakdown. Adoption is heavily concentrated in digital and knowledge-intensive sectors. The ‘Digital Technology’ cluster represents the largest share, accounting for 28 percent of adopters and 30 percent of queries. This is followed closely by academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these clusters account for over 70 percent of total adopters. This suggests that the individuals most likely to leverage agentic workflows are the most expensive assets within an organisation: software engineers, financial analysts, and market strategists. These early adopters are not dabbling; the data shows that “power users” (those with earlier access) make nine times as many agentic queries as average users, indicating that once integrated into a workflow, the technology becomes indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-agents-partners-for-enterprise-tasks-not-butlers"&gt;AI agents: Partners for enterprise tasks, not butlers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To advance beyond marketing narratives, enterprises must understand the utility these agents provide. A common view suggests agents will primarily function as “digital concierges” for rote administrative chores. However, the data challenges this view: 57 percent of all agent activity focuses on cognitive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s researchers developed a “hierarchical agentic taxonomy” to classify user intent, revealing the usage of AI agents is practical rather than experimental. The dominant use case is ‘Productivity &amp;amp; Workflow,’ which accounts for 36 percent of all agentic queries. This is followed by ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research’ at 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific anecdotes from the study illustrate how this translates to enterprise value. A procurement professional, for instance, used the assistant to scan customer case studies and identify relevant use cases before engaging with a vendor. Similarly, a finance worker delegated the tasks of filtering stock options and analysing investment information. In these scenarios, the agent handles the information gathering and initial synthesis autonomously to allow the human to focus on final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distribution provides a definite indication to operational leaders: the immediate ROI for agentic AI lies in scaling human capability rather than simply automating low-level friction. The study defines these agents as systems that “cycle automatically between three iterative phases to achieve the end goal: thinking, acting, and observing.” This capability allows them to support “deep cognitive work,” acting as a thinking partner rather than a simple butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stickiness-and-the-cognitive-migration"&gt;Stickiness and the cognitive migration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key insight for IT leaders is the “stickiness” of AI agents for enterprise workflows. The data shows that in the short term, users exhibit strong within-topic persistence. If a user engages an agent for a productivity task, their subsequent queries are highly likely to remain in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the user journey often evolves. New users frequently “test the waters” with low-stakes queries, such as asking for movie recommendations or general trivia. Over time, a transition occurs. The study notes that while users may enter via various use cases, query shares tend to migrate toward cognitively oriented domains like productivity, learning, and career development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a user employs an agent to debug code or summarise a financial report, they rarely revert to lower-value tasks. The ‘Productivity’ and ‘Workflow’ categories demonstrate the highest retention rates. This behaviour implies that early pilot programmes should anticipate a learning curve where usage matures from simple information retrieval to complex task delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “where” of agentic AI is just as important as the “what”. Perplexity’s study tracked the environments – specific websites and platforms – where these AI agents operate. The concentration of activity varies by task, but the top environments are staples of the modern enterprise stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is a primary environment for document and spreadsheet editing, while LinkedIn dominates professional networking tasks. For ‘Learning &amp;amp; Research,’ the activity is split between course platforms like Coursera and research repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and compliance officers, this presents a new risk profile. AI agents are not just reading data; they are actively manipulating it within core enterprise applications. The study explicitly defines agentic queries as those involving “browser control” or actions on external applications via APIs. When an employee tasks an agent to “summarise these customer case studies,” the agent is interacting directly with proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of environments also highlights the potential for platform-specific optimisations. For instance, the top five environments account for 96 percent of queries in professional networking, primarily on LinkedIn. This high concentration suggests that businesses could see immediate efficiency gains by developing specific governance policies or API connectors for these high-traffic platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-business-planning-for-agentic-ai-following-perplexity-s-data"&gt;Business planning for agentic AI following Perplexity’s data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diffusion of capable AI agents invites new lines of inquiry for business planning. The data from Perplexity confirms that we have passed the speculative phase. Agents are currently being used to plan and execute multi-step actions, modifying their environments rather than just exchanging information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational leaders should consider three immediate actions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the productivity and workflow &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;friction points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; within high-value teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The data shows this is where agents are naturally finding their foothold. If software engineers and financial analysts are already using these tools to edit documents or manage accounts, formalising these workflows could standardise efficiency gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the augmentation reality: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers note that while agents have autonomy, users often break tasks into smaller pieces, delegating only subtasks. This suggests that the immediate future of work is collaborative, requiring employees to be upskilled in how to effectively “manage” their AI counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address the infrastructure and security layer:&lt;/strong&gt; With agents operating in “open-world web environments” and interacting with sites like GitHub and corporate email, the perimeter for data loss prevention expands. Policies must distinguish between a chatbot offering advice and an agent executing code or sending messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the market for agentic AI is projected to grow from $8 billion in 2025 to $199 billion by 2034, the early evidence from Perplexity serves as a bellwether. The transition to enterprise workflows led by AI agents is underway, driven by the most digitally capable segments of the workforce. The challenge for the enterprise is to harness this momentum without losing control of the governance required to scale it safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accenture and Anthropic partner to boost enterprise AI integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Banner for AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." class="wp-image-111183" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

 &lt;p&gt;At any given time, the US transplant waiting list is about 100,000 people long. Thousands die waiting, and many more never make the list to begin with. Entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt wants to address this by growing organs compatible with human bodies in genetically modified pigs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, US doctors have attempted seven pig-to-human transplants, the most dramatic of which was a case where a 57-year-old man with heart failure lived two months with a pig heart supplied by Rothblatt’s company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At any given time, the US transplant waiting list is about 100,000 people long. Thousands die waiting, and many more never make the list to begin with. Entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt wants to address this by growing organs compatible with human bodies in genetically modified pigs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, US doctors have attempted seven pig-to-human transplants, the most dramatic of which was a case where a 57-year-old man with heart failure lived two months with a pig heart supplied by Rothblatt’s company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The experiment demonstrated the first life-sustaining pig-to-human organ transplant—and paved the way towards an organized clinical trial to prove they save lives consistently.&amp;nbsp;Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Antonio Regalado&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1129186/the-download-a-controversial-proposal-to-solve-climate-change-and-our-future-grids/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Google launches sub-$5 AI Plus plan in India to compete with ChatGPT Go (AI News &amp; Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch)</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-launches-sub-5-ai-plus-plan-in-india-to-compete-with-chatgpt-go/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gemini.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google on Wednesday launched its more affordable AI Plus plan in India as it seeks to compete on pricing with other low-cost AI offerings, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For new users in India, Google is offering AI Plus for ₹199 ($2.21) per month, for the first six months, after which you’ll have to pay ₹399 ($4.44) a month.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI Plus plan gives users higher limits for Gemini 3 Pro and image editing model Nano Banana Pro; access to video generation in the Gemini and Flow apps; expanded access to deep research in NotebookLM; and 200GB of storage across Photos, Drive and Gmail. Subscribers can give access to up to family members, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before this, Google’s cheapest AI subscription available in the country was AI Pro, which was priced at ₹1,950 per month ($21.69).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Google is late to customize its pricing for India, as the AI Plus plan was first introduced in Indonesia in September, and offered it in other countries that very month. OpenAI debuted its sub-$5, ChatGPT Go plan in India in August and made it available in other countries in subsequent months. The plan allows users to have 10 times more limits than the free plan for messages, image generation, and file uploads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI companies have been busy offering freebies in India as they seek to tap its huge population for users. First, Perplexity partnered with telco Airtel to offer its Pro plan for a year to all Airtel customers for free. OpenAI also offered ChatGPT Go free for a year to existing subscribers of Go and new users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Google teamed up with telco Reliance Jio to offer its AI Pro plan for 18 months at no cost to users on a certain carrier plan.&lt;/p&gt;

Hardware will never be the same. (AI | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/quilters-ai-just-designed-an-843-part-linux-computer-that-booted-on-the</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;A Los Angeles-based startup has demonstrated what it calls a breakthrough in hardware development: an artificial intelligence system that designed a fully functional Linux computer in one week — a process that would typically consume nearly three months of skilled engineering labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/"&gt;Quilter&lt;/a&gt;, which has raised more than $40 million from investors including Benchmark, Index Ventures, and Coatue, used its physics-driven AI to automate the design of a two-board computer system that booted successfully on its first attempt, requiring no costly revisions. The project, internally dubbed &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; required just 38.5 hours of human labor compared to the 428 hours that professional PCB designers quoted for the same task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also marks the first public disclosure that &lt;a href="https://www.buildc.com/"&gt;Tony Fadell&lt;/a&gt;, the engineer who led development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple and later founded Nest, has invested in the company and serves as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We didn&amp;#x27;t teach Quilter to draw; we taught it to think in physics,&amp;quot; said Sergiy Nesterenko, Quilter&amp;#x27;s chief executive and a former SpaceX engineer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The result wasn&amp;#x27;t a simulation — it was a working computer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Circuit board design remains the forgotten bottleneck that delays nearly every hardware product&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement shines a light on an unglamorous but critical chokepoint in technology development: printed circuit board layout. While semiconductors and software have received enormous attention and investment, the green fiberglass boards that connect chips, memory, and components in virtually every electronic device remain stubbornly manual to design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides auto-routers, the technology really hadn&amp;#x27;t changed since the early &amp;#x27;90s,&amp;quot; Fadell told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The best boards are still made by hand. You go to Apple, they&amp;#x27;ve got the tools, and these guys are just pushing traces, checking everything, doing flood fills—and you&amp;#x27;re like, there&amp;#x27;s got to be a better way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCB design process typically unfolds in three stages. Engineers first create a schematic — a logical diagram showing how components connect. Then a specialist manually draws the physical layout in CAD software, placing components and routing thousands of copper traces across multiple layers. Finally, the design goes to a manufacturer for fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That middle step — the layout — creates a persistent bottleneck. For a board of moderate complexity, the process typically consumes four to eight weeks. For sophisticated systems like computers or automotive electronics, timelines stretch to three months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The timeline was always this elastic thing—they&amp;#x27;d say, &amp;#x27;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s two weeks minimum,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; Fadell recalled of his experience at Apple and Nest. &amp;quot;And we&amp;#x27;d say, &amp;#x27;No, no. Work day and night. It&amp;#x27;s two weeks.&amp;#x27; But it was always this fixed bottleneck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences ripple through hardware organizations. Firmware teams sit idle waiting for physical boards to test their code. Validation engineers cannot begin debugging. Product launches slip. According to Quilter&amp;#x27;s research, only about 10 percent of first board revisions work correctly, forcing expensive and time-consuming respins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Speedrun put Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI to the test with an 843-component computer that booted on the first try&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; was designed to push the technology to its limits while producing an easily understood result: a working computer that could boot Linux, browse the internet, and run applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system consists of two boards based on&lt;a href="https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/8MMINILPD4-EVK"&gt; NXP&amp;#x27;s i.MX 8M Mini&lt;/a&gt; reference platform, a processor architecture used in automotive infotainment, industrial automation, and machine vision applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main system-on-module contains a quad-core ARM processor running at 1.8 gigahertz, 2 gigabytes of LPDDR4 memory, and 32 gigabytes of eMMC storage. A companion baseboard provides connectivity including Ethernet, USB, HDMI, and audio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the boards incorporate 843 components and 5,141 electrical connections, or &amp;quot;pins,&amp;quot; routed across eight-layer circuit board stackups manufactured by Sierra Circuits in California. The minimum trace geometry reached 2 mils (two-thousandths of an inch) on the system-on-module — fine enough to require advanced high-density interconnect manufacturing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI completed the layout with approximately 98 percent routing coverage and zero design rule violations. Both boards passed power-on testing and successfully booted &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian Linux&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We made an entire computer to demonstrate that this technology works,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;We took something that&amp;#x27;s typically quoted at 400 to 450 hours, automated the vast majority of it, and reduced it to about 30 to 40 hours of cleanup time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cleanup time is work that human engineers still perform: reviewing the AI&amp;#x27;s output, fixing any issues, and preparing final fabrication files. But even with that overhead, the total elapsed time from schematic to fabricated boards collapsed from the typical 11 weeks to a single week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unlike ChatGPT, Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI learns by playing billions of games against the laws of physics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/product"&gt;technical approach&lt;/a&gt; differs fundamentally from the large language models that have dominated recent AI headlines. Where systems like GPT-5 or Claude learn to predict text based on massive training datasets of human writing, &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/product/technology"&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI&lt;/a&gt; learns by playing what amounts to an elaborate game against the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Language models don&amp;#x27;t apply to us because this is not a language problem,&amp;quot; Nesterenko explained. &amp;quot;If you ask it to actually create a blueprint, it has no training data for that. It has no context for that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also rejected the seemingly obvious approach of training on examples of human-designed boards. Nesterenko cited three reasons: humans make frequent errors (explaining why most boards require revisions), the best designs are locked inside large companies unwilling to share proprietary data, and training on human examples would cap the AI&amp;#x27;s performance at human levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Quilter built what Nesterenko describes as a &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; where the AI agent makes sequential decisions — place this component here, route this trace there — and receives feedback based on whether the resulting design satisfies electromagnetic, thermal, and manufacturing constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What you&amp;#x27;re really changing is not the probability of getting a very specific outcome of the model, but the probability of choosing a certain action based on that experience,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach mirrors DeepMind&amp;#x27;s progression with its Go-playing systems. The original &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphago/"&gt;AlphaGo&lt;/a&gt; learned from human games, but its successor &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphazero-and-muzero/"&gt;AlphaZero&lt;/a&gt; learned purely through self-play and ultimately surpassed human capability. Quilter harbors similar ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the long term, to come up with better designs for circuit boards than humans have ever tried to do,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell drew a parallel to an earlier technological transition: &amp;quot;I remember this with assembly. You had assembly and compilers, and engineers would say, &amp;#x27;I can&amp;#x27;t trust the compiler. I&amp;#x27;m going to do the loop unrolling myself.&amp;#x27; Now very, very few people write any assembly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects PCB design to follow a similar arc: &amp;quot;I hope the same thing happens with PCB design. Sure, a few people will hold out, but these tools are going to get so good that everyone else will move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fadell and Nesterenko spent months solving a delicate problem: how to automate design without stripping engineers of control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating a task that skilled professionals have performed manually for decades raises an obvious question: how do engineers maintain control over designs that will ultimately ship in products where reliability matters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell said he spent significant time with Nesterenko working through this tension. The solution, he said, lies in allowing users to choose their level of involvement at each stage of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a control freak, you can be a control freak. If you want to say &amp;#x27;just do it for me,&amp;#x27; you can do that too—and everything in between,&amp;quot; Fadell said. &amp;quot;You can walk through each phase of the design and get involved wherever you want, or let the AI handle it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow breaks into three phases: setup, where engineers define constraints and requirements; execution, where the AI generates candidate layouts; and cleanup, where humans review and refine the output. Engineers can intervene at any point, adjusting constraints and regenerating designs until they&amp;#x27;re satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is something Tony and I talk about a lot,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;How do we give users control while still automating most of the work?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s technology has clear boundaries: 10,000 pins and 10 gigahertz mark the current limits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology has clear limitations. &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/"&gt;Quilter&lt;/a&gt; currently handles boards with up to roughly 10,000 pins — sufficient for a wide range of applications but well short of the most complex designs, which can exceed 100,000 connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physics complexity also creates boundaries. The system handles high-speed communications up to approximately 10 gigahertz, covering typical consumer electronics and many industrial applications. But advanced systems like sophisticated radar, which can operate at 100 gigahertz, exceed current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are boards where Quilter won&amp;#x27;t make enough progress to make the cleanup time worthwhile,&amp;quot; Nesterenko acknowledged. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re just not that helpful yet with the most advanced, sophisticated designs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has focused initially on categories where speed matters more than extreme complexity: test fixtures, evaluation boards, design validation boards, and environmental test hardware. These boards often sit in long queues behind higher-priority production designs, delaying engineering programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The company bets that engineers will pay the same price for a 10x speed improvement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/pricing"&gt;prices its service by pin count&lt;/a&gt;, matching the billing conventions that already exist when companies hire outside layout specialists. The pitch to customers is cost neutrality with a ten-fold improvement in speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re going to charge you roughly the same that you would pay for the pins that you would with a person,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;But the reason you choose us is that we do this 10 times faster.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a company waiting three months for a board layout, receiving it in a week fundamentally changes what&amp;#x27;s possible. Engineering teams can run multiple design experiments in parallel. Firmware developers get hardware faster. Products reach the market sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company offers free access for hobbyists, students, and small businesses with less than $50,000 in revenue — a strategy to build familiarity while targeting enterprise customers for commercial revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The iPod creator waited years to attach his name to Quilter — until he could prove the technology actually works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell said he chose this moment to publicly acknowledge his investment because the &lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; demonstration provides concrete evidence that the technology works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not about being comfortable—I was always comfortable with the team,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;This was about waiting until we had something you could hang your hat on. Now I can say, &amp;#x27;I&amp;#x27;ve used the tool. I&amp;#x27;ve seen it.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He contrasted his approach with typical investor announcements: &amp;quot;Every investor goes, I invested in this, it&amp;#x27;s gonna change the world. It&amp;#x27;s like, no, I know better. I&amp;#x27;ve used the tool. I know people who use it. I asked my startups to use the tool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell&amp;#x27;s involvement goes beyond capital. He described email exchanges running to &amp;quot;a dozen pages of details&amp;quot; covering product design, user experience, enterprise sales, and technical architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of all the investors I work with, Tony by far goes deepest with me on the product side,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Quilter succeeds, it could unlock a new generation of hardware startups that were never economically viable before&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend far beyond one company&amp;#x27;s product roadmap. If Quilter&amp;#x27;s technology scales, it could fundamentally alter the economics of building physical products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell argued that hardware development has historically moved slowly because each step in the process — schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, assembly — created friction. Other innovations have already smoothed schematic tools and manufacturing. Layout remained the stubborn holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once you shrink that from weeks to hours, you can iterate so much faster because all the other friction in the chain has been reduced,&amp;quot; Fadell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He predicted the technology would eventually extend upstream into schematic design itself, with AI that understands both logical connections and physical constraints helping engineers avoid problems earlier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, where Fadell now spends time, he encounters would-be founders who have abandoned hardware ambitions because the process seemed insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I talk to professors and startup founders, and they say, &amp;#x27;I&amp;#x27;m never doing hardware. It&amp;#x27;s too hard,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I hope we can make it easier for more people to jump in and try things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry veterans remain skeptical. Auto-routing tools — previous attempts at automation — became notorious for producing unusable results, spawning T-shirts proclaiming engineers would &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/chat/chris-gammel_s-_never-trust-the-autorouter-shirt_-on-teespring/"&gt;never trust the auto-router&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesterenko has seen the skepticism dissolve in real time. He described a recent meeting with executives from a major customer who came to discuss Quilter&amp;#x27;s capabilities. As the conversation unfolded, one executive picked up the &lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; boards and began photographing them from every angle, turning them over in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was just fascinated by the fact that this is possible now,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is no longer whether AI can design circuit boards. A working Linux computer, assembled from 843 components and booted on the first attempt, answers that definitively. The question now is what engineers will build when layout stops being the bottleneck — when hardware, as Fadell put it, finally &amp;quot;moves at the speed of thought.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that point, Nesterenko offered a prediction. &amp;quot;If you ask the average electrical engineer today whether automation or AI could at all help with the board of this complexity, they would say no,&amp;quot; he said. For decades, they would have been right. As of last week, they&amp;#x27;re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The project, internally dubbed &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; required just 38.5 hours of human labor compared to the 428 hours that professional PCB designers quoted for the same task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also marks the first public disclosure that &lt;a href="https://www.buildc.com/"&gt;Tony Fadell&lt;/a&gt;, the engineer who led development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple and later founded Nest, has invested in the company and serves as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We didn&amp;#x27;t teach Quilter to draw; we taught it to think in physics,&amp;quot; said Sergiy Nesterenko, Quilter&amp;#x27;s chief executive and a former SpaceX engineer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The result wasn&amp;#x27;t a simulation — it was a working computer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Circuit board design remains the forgotten bottleneck that delays nearly every hardware product&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement shines a light on an unglamorous but critical chokepoint in technology development: printed circuit board layout. While semiconductors and software have received enormous attention and investment, the green fiberglass boards that connect chips, memory, and components in virtually every electronic device remain stubbornly manual to design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides auto-routers, the technology really hadn&amp;#x27;t changed since the early &amp;#x27;90s,&amp;quot; Fadell told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;The best boards are still made by hand. You go to Apple, they&amp;#x27;ve got the tools, and these guys are just pushing traces, checking everything, doing flood fills—and you&amp;#x27;re like, there&amp;#x27;s got to be a better way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCB design process typically unfolds in three stages. Engineers first create a schematic — a logical diagram showing how components connect. Then a specialist manually draws the physical layout in CAD software, placing components and routing thousands of copper traces across multiple layers. Finally, the design goes to a manufacturer for fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That middle step — the layout — creates a persistent bottleneck. For a board of moderate complexity, the process typically consumes four to eight weeks. For sophisticated systems like computers or automotive electronics, timelines stretch to three months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The timeline was always this elastic thing—they&amp;#x27;d say, &amp;#x27;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s two weeks minimum,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; Fadell recalled of his experience at Apple and Nest. &amp;quot;And we&amp;#x27;d say, &amp;#x27;No, no. Work day and night. It&amp;#x27;s two weeks.&amp;#x27; But it was always this fixed bottleneck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences ripple through hardware organizations. Firmware teams sit idle waiting for physical boards to test their code. Validation engineers cannot begin debugging. Product launches slip. According to Quilter&amp;#x27;s research, only about 10 percent of first board revisions work correctly, forcing expensive and time-consuming respins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Speedrun put Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI to the test with an 843-component computer that booted on the first try&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; was designed to push the technology to its limits while producing an easily understood result: a working computer that could boot Linux, browse the internet, and run applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system consists of two boards based on&lt;a href="https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/8MMINILPD4-EVK"&gt; NXP&amp;#x27;s i.MX 8M Mini&lt;/a&gt; reference platform, a processor architecture used in automotive infotainment, industrial automation, and machine vision applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main system-on-module contains a quad-core ARM processor running at 1.8 gigahertz, 2 gigabytes of LPDDR4 memory, and 32 gigabytes of eMMC storage. A companion baseboard provides connectivity including Ethernet, USB, HDMI, and audio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the boards incorporate 843 components and 5,141 electrical connections, or &amp;quot;pins,&amp;quot; routed across eight-layer circuit board stackups manufactured by Sierra Circuits in California. The minimum trace geometry reached 2 mils (two-thousandths of an inch) on the system-on-module — fine enough to require advanced high-density interconnect manufacturing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI completed the layout with approximately 98 percent routing coverage and zero design rule violations. Both boards passed power-on testing and successfully booted &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian Linux&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We made an entire computer to demonstrate that this technology works,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;We took something that&amp;#x27;s typically quoted at 400 to 450 hours, automated the vast majority of it, and reduced it to about 30 to 40 hours of cleanup time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cleanup time is work that human engineers still perform: reviewing the AI&amp;#x27;s output, fixing any issues, and preparing final fabrication files. But even with that overhead, the total elapsed time from schematic to fabricated boards collapsed from the typical 11 weeks to a single week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unlike ChatGPT, Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI learns by playing billions of games against the laws of physics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/product"&gt;technical approach&lt;/a&gt; differs fundamentally from the large language models that have dominated recent AI headlines. Where systems like GPT-5 or Claude learn to predict text based on massive training datasets of human writing, &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/product/technology"&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s AI&lt;/a&gt; learns by playing what amounts to an elaborate game against the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Language models don&amp;#x27;t apply to us because this is not a language problem,&amp;quot; Nesterenko explained. &amp;quot;If you ask it to actually create a blueprint, it has no training data for that. It has no context for that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also rejected the seemingly obvious approach of training on examples of human-designed boards. Nesterenko cited three reasons: humans make frequent errors (explaining why most boards require revisions), the best designs are locked inside large companies unwilling to share proprietary data, and training on human examples would cap the AI&amp;#x27;s performance at human levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Quilter built what Nesterenko describes as a &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; where the AI agent makes sequential decisions — place this component here, route this trace there — and receives feedback based on whether the resulting design satisfies electromagnetic, thermal, and manufacturing constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What you&amp;#x27;re really changing is not the probability of getting a very specific outcome of the model, but the probability of choosing a certain action based on that experience,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach mirrors DeepMind&amp;#x27;s progression with its Go-playing systems. The original &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphago/"&gt;AlphaGo&lt;/a&gt; learned from human games, but its successor &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphazero-and-muzero/"&gt;AlphaZero&lt;/a&gt; learned purely through self-play and ultimately surpassed human capability. Quilter harbors similar ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the long term, to come up with better designs for circuit boards than humans have ever tried to do,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell drew a parallel to an earlier technological transition: &amp;quot;I remember this with assembly. You had assembly and compilers, and engineers would say, &amp;#x27;I can&amp;#x27;t trust the compiler. I&amp;#x27;m going to do the loop unrolling myself.&amp;#x27; Now very, very few people write any assembly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects PCB design to follow a similar arc: &amp;quot;I hope the same thing happens with PCB design. Sure, a few people will hold out, but these tools are going to get so good that everyone else will move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fadell and Nesterenko spent months solving a delicate problem: how to automate design without stripping engineers of control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automating a task that skilled professionals have performed manually for decades raises an obvious question: how do engineers maintain control over designs that will ultimately ship in products where reliability matters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell said he spent significant time with Nesterenko working through this tension. The solution, he said, lies in allowing users to choose their level of involvement at each stage of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#x27;re a control freak, you can be a control freak. If you want to say &amp;#x27;just do it for me,&amp;#x27; you can do that too—and everything in between,&amp;quot; Fadell said. &amp;quot;You can walk through each phase of the design and get involved wherever you want, or let the AI handle it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow breaks into three phases: setup, where engineers define constraints and requirements; execution, where the AI generates candidate layouts; and cleanup, where humans review and refine the output. Engineers can intervene at any point, adjusting constraints and regenerating designs until they&amp;#x27;re satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is something Tony and I talk about a lot,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;How do we give users control while still automating most of the work?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quilter&amp;#x27;s technology has clear boundaries: 10,000 pins and 10 gigahertz mark the current limits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology has clear limitations. &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/"&gt;Quilter&lt;/a&gt; currently handles boards with up to roughly 10,000 pins — sufficient for a wide range of applications but well short of the most complex designs, which can exceed 100,000 connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physics complexity also creates boundaries. The system handles high-speed communications up to approximately 10 gigahertz, covering typical consumer electronics and many industrial applications. But advanced systems like sophisticated radar, which can operate at 100 gigahertz, exceed current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are boards where Quilter won&amp;#x27;t make enough progress to make the cleanup time worthwhile,&amp;quot; Nesterenko acknowledged. &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re just not that helpful yet with the most advanced, sophisticated designs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has focused initially on categories where speed matters more than extreme complexity: test fixtures, evaluation boards, design validation boards, and environmental test hardware. These boards often sit in long queues behind higher-priority production designs, delaying engineering programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The company bets that engineers will pay the same price for a 10x speed improvement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quilter &lt;a href="https://www.quilter.ai/pricing"&gt;prices its service by pin count&lt;/a&gt;, matching the billing conventions that already exist when companies hire outside layout specialists. The pitch to customers is cost neutrality with a ten-fold improvement in speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re going to charge you roughly the same that you would pay for the pins that you would with a person,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said. &amp;quot;But the reason you choose us is that we do this 10 times faster.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a company waiting three months for a board layout, receiving it in a week fundamentally changes what&amp;#x27;s possible. Engineering teams can run multiple design experiments in parallel. Firmware developers get hardware faster. Products reach the market sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company offers free access for hobbyists, students, and small businesses with less than $50,000 in revenue — a strategy to build familiarity while targeting enterprise customers for commercial revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The iPod creator waited years to attach his name to Quilter — until he could prove the technology actually works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell said he chose this moment to publicly acknowledge his investment because the &lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; demonstration provides concrete evidence that the technology works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s not about being comfortable—I was always comfortable with the team,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;This was about waiting until we had something you could hang your hat on. Now I can say, &amp;#x27;I&amp;#x27;ve used the tool. I&amp;#x27;ve seen it.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He contrasted his approach with typical investor announcements: &amp;quot;Every investor goes, I invested in this, it&amp;#x27;s gonna change the world. It&amp;#x27;s like, no, I know better. I&amp;#x27;ve used the tool. I know people who use it. I asked my startups to use the tool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell&amp;#x27;s involvement goes beyond capital. He described email exchanges running to &amp;quot;a dozen pages of details&amp;quot; covering product design, user experience, enterprise sales, and technical architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of all the investors I work with, Tony by far goes deepest with me on the product side,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Quilter succeeds, it could unlock a new generation of hardware startups that were never economically viable before&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend far beyond one company&amp;#x27;s product roadmap. If Quilter&amp;#x27;s technology scales, it could fundamentally alter the economics of building physical products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadell argued that hardware development has historically moved slowly because each step in the process — schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, assembly — created friction. Other innovations have already smoothed schematic tools and manufacturing. Layout remained the stubborn holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once you shrink that from weeks to hours, you can iterate so much faster because all the other friction in the chain has been reduced,&amp;quot; Fadell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He predicted the technology would eventually extend upstream into schematic design itself, with AI that understands both logical connections and physical constraints helping engineers avoid problems earlier in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, where Fadell now spends time, he encounters would-be founders who have abandoned hardware ambitions because the process seemed insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I talk to professors and startup founders, and they say, &amp;#x27;I&amp;#x27;m never doing hardware. It&amp;#x27;s too hard,&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I hope we can make it easier for more people to jump in and try things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry veterans remain skeptical. Auto-routing tools — previous attempts at automation — became notorious for producing unusable results, spawning T-shirts proclaiming engineers would &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/chat/chris-gammel_s-_never-trust-the-autorouter-shirt_-on-teespring/"&gt;never trust the auto-router&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesterenko has seen the skepticism dissolve in real time. He described a recent meeting with executives from a major customer who came to discuss Quilter&amp;#x27;s capabilities. As the conversation unfolded, one executive picked up the &lt;a href="https://quilter.ai/project-speedrun"&gt;Project Speedrun&lt;/a&gt; boards and began photographing them from every angle, turning them over in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was just fascinated by the fact that this is possible now,&amp;quot; Nesterenko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is no longer whether AI can design circuit boards. A working Linux computer, assembled from 843 components and booted on the first attempt, answers that definitively. The question now is what engineers will build when layout stops being the bottleneck — when hardware, as Fadell put it, finally &amp;quot;moves at the speed of thought.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that point, Nesterenko offered a prediction. &amp;quot;If you ask the average electrical engineer today whether automation or AI could at all help with the board of this complexity, they would say no,&amp;quot; he said. For decades, they would have been right. As of last week, they&amp;#x27;re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

But they&amp;#x27;re hitting a wall when that code reaches production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;#x27;t necessarily the AI-generated code itself. It&amp;#x27;s that traditional monitoring tools generally struggle to provide the granular, function-level data AI agents need to understand how code actually behaves in complex production environments. Without that context, agents can&amp;#x27;t detect issues or generate fixes that account for production reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a challenge that startup&lt;a href="https://www.hud.io/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is looking to help solve with the launch of its runtime code sensor on Wednesday. The company&amp;#x27;s eponymous sensor runs alongside production code, automatically tracking how every function behaves, giving developers a heads-up on what&amp;#x27;s actually occurring in deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every software team building at scale faces the same fundamental challenge: building high-quality products that work well in the real world,&amp;quot; Roee Adler, CEO and founder of Hud, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.  &amp;quot;In the new era of AI-accelerated development, not knowing how code behaves in production becomes an even bigger part of that challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What software developers are struggling with &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain points that developers are facing are fairly consistent across engineering organizations. Moshik Eilon, group tech lead at Monday.com, oversees 130 engineer and describes a familiar frustration with traditional monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you get an alert, you usually end up checking an endpoint that has an error rate or high latency, and you want to drill down to see the downstream dependencies,&amp;quot; Eilon told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;A lot of times it&amp;#x27;s the actual application, and then it&amp;#x27;s a black box. You just get 80% downstream latency on the application.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step typically involves manual detective work across multiple tools. Check the logs. Correlate timestamps. Try to reconstruct what the application was doing. For novel issues deep in a large codebase, teams often lack the exact data they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Marashlian, CTO and co-founder at Drata, saw his engineers spending hours on what he referred to as an &amp;quot;investigation tax.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They were mapping a generic alert to a specific code owner, then digging through logs to reconstruct the state of the application,&amp;quot; Marashlian told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;We wanted to eliminate that so our team could focus entirely on the fix rather than the discovery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drata&amp;#x27;s architecture compounds the challenge. The company integrates with numerous external services to deliver automated compliance, which creates sophisticated investigations when issues arise. Engineers trace behavior across a very large codebase spanning risk, compliance, integrations, and reporting modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marashlian identified three specific problems that drove Drata toward investing in runtime sensors. The first issue was the cost of context switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our data was scattered, so our engineers had to act as human bridges between disconnected tools,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second issue, he noted, is alert fatigue. &amp;quot;When you have a complex distributed system, general alert channels become a constant stream of background noise, what our team describes as a &amp;#x27;ding, ding, ding&amp;#x27; effect that eventually gets ignored,&amp;quot; Marashlian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third key driver was a need to integrate with the company&amp;#x27;s AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An AI agent can write code, but it cannot fix a production bug if it can&amp;#x27;t see the runtime variables or the root cause,&amp;quot; Marashlian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why traditional APMs can&amp;#x27;t solve the problem easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have long relied on a class of tools and services known as Application Performance Monitoring (APM). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the current pace of agentic AI development and modern development workflows, both Monday.com and Drata simply were not able to get the required visibility from existing APM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I would want to get this information from Datadog or from CoreLogix, I would just have to ingest tons of logs or tons of spans, and I would pay a lot of money,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eilon noted that Monday.com used very low sampling rates because of cost constraints. That meant they often missed the exact data needed to debug issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional application performance monitoring tools also require prediction, which is a problem because sometimes a developer just doesn&amp;#x27;t know what they don&amp;#x27;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Traditional observability requires you to anticipate what you&amp;#x27;ll need to debug,&amp;quot; Marashlian said. &amp;quot;But when a novel issue surfaces, especially deep within a large, complex codebase, you&amp;#x27;re often missing the exact data you need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drata evaluated several solutions in the AI site reliability engineering and automated incident response categories and didn&amp;#x27;t find what was needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Most tools we evaluated were excellent at managing the incident process, routing tickets, summarizing Slack threads, or correlating graphs,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But they often stopped short of the code itself. They could tell us &amp;#x27;Service A is down,&amp;#x27; but they couldn&amp;#x27;t tell us why specifically.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common capability in some tools including error monitors like Sentry is the ability to capture exceptions. The challenge, according to Adler, is that being made aware of exceptions is nice, but that doesn&amp;#x27;t connect them to business impact or provide the execution context AI agents need to propose fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How runtime sensors work differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runtime sensors push intelligence to the edge where code executes. Hud&amp;#x27;s sensor runs as an SDK that integrates with a single line of code. It sees every function execution but only sends lightweight aggregate data unless something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When errors or slowdowns occur, the sensor automatically gathers deep forensic data including HTTP parameters, database queries and responses, and full execution context. The system establishes performance baselines within a day and can alert on both dramatic slowdowns and outliers that percentile-based monitoring misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now we just get all of this information for all of the functions regardless of what level they are, even for underlying packages,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;Sometimes you might have an issue that is very deep, and we still see it pretty fast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform delivers data through four channels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web application&lt;/b&gt; for centralized monitoring and analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IDE extensions&lt;/b&gt; for VS Code, JetBrains and Cursor that surface production metrics directly where code is written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MCP server&lt;/b&gt; that feeds structured data to AI coding agents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alerting system&lt;/b&gt; that identifies issues without manual configuration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCP server integration is critical for AI-assisted development. Monday.com engineers now query production behavior directly within Cursor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can just ask Cursor a question: Hey, why is this endpoint slow?&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;When it uses the Hud MCP, I get all of the granular metrics, and this function is 30% slower since this deployment. Then I can also find the root cause.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This changes the incident response workflow. Instead of starting in Datadog and drilling down through layers, engineers start by asking an AI agent to diagnose the issue. The agent has immediate access to function-level production data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From voodoo incidents to minutes-long fixes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift from theoretical capability to practical impact becomes clear in how engineering teams actually use runtime sensors. What used to take hours or days of detective work now resolves in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m used to having these voodoo incidents where there is a CPU spike and you don&amp;#x27;t know where it came from,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;A few years ago, I had such an incident and I had to build my own tool that takes the CPU profile and the memory dump. Now I just have all of the function data and I&amp;#x27;ve seen engineers just solve it so fast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Drata, the quantified impact is dramatic. The company built an internal /triage command that support engineers run within their AI assistants to instantly identify root causes. Manual triage work dropped from approximately 3 hours per day to under 10 minutes. Mean time to resolution improved by approximately 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also generates a daily &amp;quot;Heads Up&amp;quot; report of quick-win errors. Because the root cause is already captured, developers can fix these issues in minutes. Support engineers now perform forensic diagnosis that previously required a senior developer. Ticket throughput increased without expanding the L2 team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where this technology fits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runtime sensors occupy a distinct space from traditional APMs, which excel at service-level monitoring but struggle with granular, cost-effective function-level data. They differ from error monitors that capture exceptions without business context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical requirements for supporting AI coding agents differ from human-facing observability. Agents need structured, function-level data they can reason over. They can&amp;#x27;t parse and correlate raw logs the way humans do. Traditional observability also assumes you can predict what you&amp;#x27;ll need to debug and instrument accordingly. That approach breaks down with AI-generated code where engineers may not deeply understand every function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think we&amp;#x27;re entering a new age of AI-generated code and this puzzle, this jigsaw puzzle of a new stack emerging,&amp;quot; Adler said. &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#x27;t think that the cloud computing observability stack is going to fit neatly into how the future looks like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organizations already using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, runtime intelligence provides a safety layer for production deployments. The technology enables what Monday.com calls &amp;quot;agentic investigation&amp;quot; rather than manual tool-hopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader implication relates to trust.  &amp;quot;With AI-generated code, we are getting much more AI-generated code, and engineers start not knowing all of the code,&amp;quot; Eilon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Runtime sensors bridge that knowledge gap by providing production context directly in the IDE where code is written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises looking to scale AI code generation beyond pilots, runtime intelligence addresses a fundamental problem. AI agents generate code based on assumptions about system behavior. Production environments are complex and surprising. Function-level behavioral data captured automatically from production gives agents the context they need to generate reliable code at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations should evaluate whether their existing observability stack can cost-effectively provide the granularity AI agents require. If achieving function-level visibility requires dramatically increasing ingestion costs or manual instrumentation, runtime sensors may offer a more sustainable architecture for AI-accelerated development workflows already emerging across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;Engineering teams are generating more code with AI agents than ever before. But they&amp;#x27;re hitting a wall when that code reaches production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;#x27;t necessarily the AI-generated code itself. It&amp;#x27;s that traditional monitoring tools generally struggle to provide the granular, function-level data AI agents need to understand how code actually behaves in complex production environments. Without that context, agents can&amp;#x27;t detect issues or generate fixes that account for production reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a challenge that startup&lt;a href="https://www.hud.io/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is looking to help solve with the launch of its runtime code sensor on Wednesday. The company&amp;#x27;s eponymous sensor runs alongside production code, automatically tracking how every function behaves, giving developers a heads-up on what&amp;#x27;s actually occurring in deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every software team building at scale faces the same fundamental challenge: building high-quality products that work well in the real world,&amp;quot; Roee Adler, CEO and founder of Hud, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.  &amp;quot;In the new era of AI-accelerated development, not knowing how code behaves in production becomes an even bigger part of that challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What software developers are struggling with &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain points that developers are facing are fairly consistent across engineering organizations. Moshik Eilon, group tech lead at Monday.com, oversees 130 engineer and describes a familiar frustration with traditional monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you get an alert, you usually end up checking an endpoint that has an error rate or high latency, and you want to drill down to see the downstream dependencies,&amp;quot; Eilon told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;A lot of times it&amp;#x27;s the actual application, and then it&amp;#x27;s a black box. You just get 80% downstream latency on the application.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step typically involves manual detective work across multiple tools. Check the logs. Correlate timestamps. Try to reconstruct what the application was doing. For novel issues deep in a large codebase, teams often lack the exact data they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Marashlian, CTO and co-founder at Drata, saw his engineers spending hours on what he referred to as an &amp;quot;investigation tax.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They were mapping a generic alert to a specific code owner, then digging through logs to reconstruct the state of the application,&amp;quot; Marashlian told VentureBeat. &amp;quot;We wanted to eliminate that so our team could focus entirely on the fix rather than the discovery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drata&amp;#x27;s architecture compounds the challenge. The company integrates with numerous external services to deliver automated compliance, which creates sophisticated investigations when issues arise. Engineers trace behavior across a very large codebase spanning risk, compliance, integrations, and reporting modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marashlian identified three specific problems that drove Drata toward investing in runtime sensors. The first issue was the cost of context switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our data was scattered, so our engineers had to act as human bridges between disconnected tools,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second issue, he noted, is alert fatigue. &amp;quot;When you have a complex distributed system, general alert channels become a constant stream of background noise, what our team describes as a &amp;#x27;ding, ding, ding&amp;#x27; effect that eventually gets ignored,&amp;quot; Marashlian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third key driver was a need to integrate with the company&amp;#x27;s AI strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An AI agent can write code, but it cannot fix a production bug if it can&amp;#x27;t see the runtime variables or the root cause,&amp;quot; Marashlian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why traditional APMs can&amp;#x27;t solve the problem easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have long relied on a class of tools and services known as Application Performance Monitoring (APM). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the current pace of agentic AI development and modern development workflows, both Monday.com and Drata simply were not able to get the required visibility from existing APM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I would want to get this information from Datadog or from CoreLogix, I would just have to ingest tons of logs or tons of spans, and I would pay a lot of money,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eilon noted that Monday.com used very low sampling rates because of cost constraints. That meant they often missed the exact data needed to debug issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional application performance monitoring tools also require prediction, which is a problem because sometimes a developer just doesn&amp;#x27;t know what they don&amp;#x27;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Traditional observability requires you to anticipate what you&amp;#x27;ll need to debug,&amp;quot; Marashlian said. &amp;quot;But when a novel issue surfaces, especially deep within a large, complex codebase, you&amp;#x27;re often missing the exact data you need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drata evaluated several solutions in the AI site reliability engineering and automated incident response categories and didn&amp;#x27;t find what was needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Most tools we evaluated were excellent at managing the incident process, routing tickets, summarizing Slack threads, or correlating graphs,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But they often stopped short of the code itself. They could tell us &amp;#x27;Service A is down,&amp;#x27; but they couldn&amp;#x27;t tell us why specifically.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common capability in some tools including error monitors like Sentry is the ability to capture exceptions. The challenge, according to Adler, is that being made aware of exceptions is nice, but that doesn&amp;#x27;t connect them to business impact or provide the execution context AI agents need to propose fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How runtime sensors work differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runtime sensors push intelligence to the edge where code executes. Hud&amp;#x27;s sensor runs as an SDK that integrates with a single line of code. It sees every function execution but only sends lightweight aggregate data unless something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When errors or slowdowns occur, the sensor automatically gathers deep forensic data including HTTP parameters, database queries and responses, and full execution context. The system establishes performance baselines within a day and can alert on both dramatic slowdowns and outliers that percentile-based monitoring misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now we just get all of this information for all of the functions regardless of what level they are, even for underlying packages,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;Sometimes you might have an issue that is very deep, and we still see it pretty fast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform delivers data through four channels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web application&lt;/b&gt; for centralized monitoring and analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IDE extensions&lt;/b&gt; for VS Code, JetBrains and Cursor that surface production metrics directly where code is written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MCP server&lt;/b&gt; that feeds structured data to AI coding agents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alerting system&lt;/b&gt; that identifies issues without manual configuration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCP server integration is critical for AI-assisted development. Monday.com engineers now query production behavior directly within Cursor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can just ask Cursor a question: Hey, why is this endpoint slow?&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;When it uses the Hud MCP, I get all of the granular metrics, and this function is 30% slower since this deployment. Then I can also find the root cause.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This changes the incident response workflow. Instead of starting in Datadog and drilling down through layers, engineers start by asking an AI agent to diagnose the issue. The agent has immediate access to function-level production data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From voodoo incidents to minutes-long fixes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift from theoretical capability to practical impact becomes clear in how engineering teams actually use runtime sensors. What used to take hours or days of detective work now resolves in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m used to having these voodoo incidents where there is a CPU spike and you don&amp;#x27;t know where it came from,&amp;quot; Eilon said. &amp;quot;A few years ago, I had such an incident and I had to build my own tool that takes the CPU profile and the memory dump. Now I just have all of the function data and I&amp;#x27;ve seen engineers just solve it so fast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Drata, the quantified impact is dramatic. The company built an internal /triage command that support engineers run within their AI assistants to instantly identify root causes. Manual triage work dropped from approximately 3 hours per day to under 10 minutes. Mean time to resolution improved by approximately 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also generates a daily &amp;quot;Heads Up&amp;quot; report of quick-win errors. Because the root cause is already captured, developers can fix these issues in minutes. Support engineers now perform forensic diagnosis that previously required a senior developer. Ticket throughput increased without expanding the L2 team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where this technology fits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runtime sensors occupy a distinct space from traditional APMs, which excel at service-level monitoring but struggle with granular, cost-effective function-level data. They differ from error monitors that capture exceptions without business context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical requirements for supporting AI coding agents differ from human-facing observability. Agents need structured, function-level data they can reason over. They can&amp;#x27;t parse and correlate raw logs the way humans do. Traditional observability also assumes you can predict what you&amp;#x27;ll need to debug and instrument accordingly. That approach breaks down with AI-generated code where engineers may not deeply understand every function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think we&amp;#x27;re entering a new age of AI-generated code and this puzzle, this jigsaw puzzle of a new stack emerging,&amp;quot; Adler said. &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#x27;t think that the cloud computing observability stack is going to fit neatly into how the future looks like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For organizations already using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, runtime intelligence provides a safety layer for production deployments.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said that these features will save the hassle of exporting images to other tools for editing and importing them back. It added that generation models like Nano Banana are good for creating images, but users often need granular tools for editing that work without any text prompts. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Figma has improved its lasso tool for selection. Now you can use it to select an object, remove it, or isolate it to move it around. When you move around the object, the image still retains other characteristics, such as background and color. Users can also select an object to adjust factors like lighting, shadow, color, or focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is also bringing an image expansion feature to its design suite. This feature is handy when you are adjusting a creative for a particular format and need to fill in the background or other details. For instance, creating a web banner or mobile banner from a 1×1 image. It essentially saves you from constantly cropping an image and adjusting elements within it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074654" height="383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ezgif-8bda4c8d57256f21.gif?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Besides adding these features, Figma is collating all its image editing tools in one toolbar for easier access. You can select objects or parts of images, change background color, and add annotations or text using this toolbar. The company said removing background is one of the most common actions on the platform, and that is why it is getting a prominent spot on the new toolbar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rivals like Adobe and Canva have had object removal for a few years now. Figma is finally catching up to offer these features. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company said the new image editing features are available on Figma Design and Draw, with plans to make them available across Figma tools next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Figma’s launch comes on the same day as Adobe making some of these features available to users within ChatGPT. Figma was one of the launch partners of the app, calling on ChatGPT in October.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tavus, the AI startup that creates digital replicas using voice and face cloning technology, has launched its AI Santa experience for the second year in a row. This allows parents and children to video chat with a virtual version of the jolly old Saint Nick.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After signing up for a free account, users can interact with AI Santa via text, phone, or video chat. Users can tell AI Santa what they want for Christmas, share their holiday plans, and find out if they’re on the naughty or nice list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This year, the company debuted an improved version of AI Santa, designed to be more expressive and emotionally aware. Santa is now a “Tavus PAL,” the company’s name for its real-time AI agents that are built to see, hear, respond, and appear human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AI Santa can now see users’ expressions and gestures and respond to them. It also remembers users’ conversations and interests, creating a more personalized experience. Notably, it now can take actions of its own, including searching the web for present ideas or even perform everyday tasks like drafting emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074427" height="427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/santapostcard-Tavus.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tavus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During testing, the conversation with AI Santa was engaging for the most part. When we mentioned wanting a new PlayStation for Christmas, Santa followed up with questions about our favorite video games, showing knowledge of specific titles like Baldur’s Gate 3. It also smiled back when we did. (We didn’t like that part very much, but maybe others will.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Users appear to be enjoying the improved experience so far. Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been reports linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the suicide deaths of teenagers. Character.AI removed access to its chatbots for users under 18 in October.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074428" height="424" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/santaDesktop.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tavus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Raza emphasized that the AI Santa experience is designed for families to enjoy together, with safety measures in place to ensure appropriate interactions. Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;A new helper has arrived at the North Pole in recent years: AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;During our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Still, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been reports linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the suicide deaths of teenagers. Character.AI removed access to its chatbots for users under 18 in October.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3074428" height="424" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/santaDesktop.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Tavus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Raza emphasized that the AI Santa experience is designed for families to enjoy together, with safety measures in place to ensure appropriate interactions. Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ai-startup-tavus-founder-says-users-talk-to-its-ai-santa-for-hours-per-day/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] OpenAI report reveals a 6x productivity gap between AI power users and everyone else (AI | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-report-reveals-a-6x-productivity-gap-between-ai-power-users-and</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The tools are available to everyone. The subscription is company-wide. The training sessions have been held. And yet, in offices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, a stark divide is opening between workers who have woven artificial intelligence into the fabric of their daily work and colleagues who have barely touched it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap is not small. According to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from OpenAI analyzing usage patterns across its more than one million business customers, workers at the &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/the-state-of-enterprise-ai-2025-report/"&gt;95th percentile of AI adoption&lt;/a&gt; are sending six times as many messages to ChatGPT as the median employee at the same companies. For specific tasks, the divide is even more dramatic: frontier workers send 17 times as many coding-related messages as their typical peers, and among data analysts, the heaviest users engage the data analysis tool 16 times more frequently than the median.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a story about access. It is a story about a new form of workplace stratification emerging in real time — one that may be reshaping who gets ahead, who falls behind, and what it means to be a skilled worker in the age of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone has the same tools, but not everyone is using them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking finding in the &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt; is how little access explains. &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/business/enterprise?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_B_SEM_GBR_Core_ENT_BAU_ACQ_PER_BRD_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_080625&amp;amp;utm_term=chatgpt%20enterprise&amp;amp;utm_content=182507886919&amp;amp;utm_ad=779434575256&amp;amp;utm_match=b&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22855802308&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-I0E5ew3OYocHAOSOiKw516uqob_&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiArt_JBhCTARIsADQZaylE-8Q0a0VjiXwyRLvFkD9BIkgt4EpWCm6v7alzBtNKWKE5_7J_3SYaArnTEALw_wcB"&gt;ChatGPT Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; is now deployed across more than 7 million workplace seats globally, a nine-fold increase from a year ago. The tools are the same for everyone. The capabilities are identical. And yet usage varies by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among monthly active users — people who have logged in at least once in the past 30 days — &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;19 percent have never tried the data analysis feature&lt;/a&gt;. Fourteen percent have never used reasoning capabilities. Twelve percent have never used search. These are not obscure features buried in submenus; they are core functionality that OpenAI highlights as transformative for knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern inverts among daily users. &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;Only 3 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people who use ChatGPT every day have never tried data analysis; just 1 percent have skipped reasoning or search. The implication is clear: the divide is not between those who have access and those who don&amp;#x27;t, but between those who have made AI a daily habit and those for whom it remains an occasional novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Employees who experiment more are saving dramatically more time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt; suggests that AI productivity gains are not evenly distributed across all users but concentrated among those who use the technology most intensively. Workers who engage across approximately seven distinct task types — data analysis, coding, image generation, translation, writing, and others — report saving five times as much time as those who use only four. Employees who save more than 10 hours per week consume eight times more AI credits than those who report no time savings at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a compounding dynamic. Workers who experiment broadly discover more uses. More uses lead to greater productivity gains. Greater productivity gains presumably lead to better performance reviews, more interesting assignments, and faster advancement—which in turn provides more opportunity and incentive to deepen AI usage further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five percent of surveyed workers report being able to complete tasks they previously could not perform, including programming support, spreadsheet automation, and technical troubleshooting. For workers who have embraced these capabilities, the boundaries of their roles are expanding. For those who have not, the boundaries may be contracting by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The corporate AI paradox: $40 billion spent, 95 percent seeing no return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual usage gap documented by OpenAI mirrors a broader pattern identified by a separate study from &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;MIT&amp;#x27;s Project NANDA&lt;/a&gt;. Despite $30 billion to $40 billion invested in generative AI initiatives, only 5 percent of organizations are seeing transformative returns. The researchers call this the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.searchyour.ai/en/genai-divide-state-ai-business-2025-mit-nanda"&gt;GenAI Divide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — a gap separating the few organizations that succeed in transforming processes with adaptive AI systems from the majority that remain stuck in pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT report found &lt;a href="https://www.legal.io/articles/5719519/MIT-Report-Finds-95-of-AI-Pilots-Fail-to-Deliver-ROI-Exposing-GenAI-Divide"&gt;limited disruption&lt;/a&gt; across industries: only two of nine major sectors—technology and media—show material business transformation from generative AI use. Large firms lead in pilot volume but lag in successful deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern is consistent across both studies. Organizations and individuals are buying the technology. They are launching pilots. They are attending training sessions. But somewhere between adoption and transformation, most are getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;While official AI projects stall, a shadow economy is thriving&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;MIT study&lt;/a&gt; reveals a striking disconnect: while only 40 percent of companies have purchased official LLM subscriptions, employees in over 90 percent of companies regularly use personal AI tools for work. Nearly every respondent reported using LLMs in some form as part of their regular workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This &amp;#x27;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"&gt;shadow AI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x27; often delivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the divide,&amp;quot; MIT&amp;#x27;s Project NANDA found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shadow economy offers a clue to what&amp;#x27;s happening at the individual level within organizations. Employees who take initiative — who sign up for personal subscriptions, who experiment on their own time, who figure out how to integrate AI into their workflows without waiting for IT approval — are pulling ahead of colleagues who wait for official guidance that may never come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shadow systems, largely unsanctioned, often deliver better performance and faster adoption than corporate tools. Worker sentiment reveals a preference for flexible, responsive tools — precisely the kind of experimentation that separates OpenAI&amp;#x27;s frontier workers from the median.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biggest gaps show up in technical work that used to require specialists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest relative gaps between frontier and median workers appear in coding, writing, and analysis — precisely the task categories where AI capabilities have advanced most rapidly. Frontier workers are not just doing the same work faster; they appear to be doing different work entirely, expanding into technical domains that were previously inaccessible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/business/enterprise?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_B_SEM_GBR_Core_ENT_BAU_ACQ_PER_BRD_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_080625&amp;amp;utm_term=chatgpt%20enterprise&amp;amp;utm_content=182507886919&amp;amp;utm_ad=779434575253&amp;amp;utm_match=b&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22855802308&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-I0E5ew3OYocHAOSOiKw516uqob_&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiArt_JBhCTARIsADQZaykhZ9zJ10fojuPYA8XhHxR0jVT-WbgS4kfA7IIaTohf7yAByZszI-AaAkeREALw_wcB"&gt;ChatGPT Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; users outside of engineering, IT, and research, coding-related messages have grown 36 percent over the past six months. Someone in marketing or HR who learns to write scripts and automate workflows is becoming a categorically different employee than a peer who has not — even if they hold the same title and started with the same skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic research on AI and productivity offers a complicated picture. Several studies cited in the OpenAI report find that AI has an &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;equalizing effect&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; disproportionately helping lower-performing workers close the gap with their higher-performing peers. But the equalizing effect may apply only within the population of workers who actually use AI regularly. A meaningful share of workers are not in that group at all. They remain light users or non-users, even as their more adventurous colleagues pull away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Companies are divided too, and the gap is widening by the month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divide is not only between individual workers. It exists between entire organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier firms — those at the 95th percentile of adoption intensity — generate approximately twice as many AI messages per employee as the median enterprise. For messages routed through custom GPTs, purpose-built tools that automate specific workflows, the gap widens to seven-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers suggest fundamentally different operating models. At median companies, AI may be a productivity tool that individual workers use at their discretion. At frontier firms, AI appears to be embedded in core infrastructure: standardized workflows, persistent custom tools, systematic integration with internal data systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt; notes that roughly one in four enterprises still has not enabled connectors that give AI access to company data—a basic step that dramatically increases the technology&amp;#x27;s utility. The MIT study found that companies that purchased AI tools from specialized vendors succeeded &lt;a href="https://www.tekedia.com/the-genai-divide-mit-report-shows-why-most-business-ai-projects-are-stalling/"&gt;67 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the time, while internal builds had only a one-in-three success rate. For many organizations, the AI era has technically arrived but has not yet begun in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The technology is no longer the problem — organizations are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For executives, the data presents an uncomfortable challenge. The technology is no longer the constraint. OpenAI notes that it releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days; the models are advancing faster than most organizations can absorb. The bottleneck has shifted from what AI can do to whether organizations are structured to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The dividing line isn&amp;#x27;t intelligence,&amp;quot; the &lt;a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"&gt;MIT authors write&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with enterprise AI have to do with memory, adaptability, and learning capability. Problems stem less from regulations or model performance, and more from tools that fail to learn or adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading firms, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt;, consistently invest in executive sponsorship, data readiness, workflow standardization, and deliberate change management. They build cultures where custom AI tools are created, shared, and refined across teams. They track performance and run evaluations. They make AI adoption a strategic priority rather than an individual choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest are leaving it to chance — hoping that workers will discover the tools on their own, experiment on their own time, and somehow propagate best practices without infrastructure or incentive. The six-fold gap suggests this approach is not working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The window to catch up is closing faster than most companies realize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enterprise contracts locking in over the next 18 months, there&amp;#x27;s a shrinking window for vendors and adopters to cross the divide.The GenAI Divide identified by the &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;MIT report&lt;/a&gt; is not going to last forever. But the organizations that figure out a way across it soonest will be the ones that define the next era of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both reports carry caveats. The OpenAI data comes from a company with an obvious interest in promoting AI adoption. The productivity figures are self-reported by customers already paying for the product. The MIT study, while independent, relies on interviews and surveys rather than direct measurement. The long-term effects of this technology on employment, wages, and workplace dynamics remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the core finding — that access alone does not produce adoption, and that adoption varies enormously even within organizations that have made identical tools available to all — is consistent with how previous technologies have diffused through the economy. Spreadsheets, email, and the internet all created similar divides before eventually becoming universal. The question is how long the current gap persists, who benefits during the transition, and what happens to workers who find themselves on the wrong side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the divide is stark. Ninety percent of users said they prefer humans for &amp;quot;mission-critical work,&amp;quot; while AI has &amp;quot;won the war for simple work.&amp;quot; The workers who are pulling ahead are not doing so because they have access their colleagues lack. They are pulling ahead because they decided to use what everyone already has—and kept using it until they figured out what it could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6x gap is not about technology. It is about behavior. And behavior, unlike software, cannot be deployed with a company-wide rollout.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;The tools are available to everyone.

Worker sentiment reveals a preference for flexible, responsive tools — precisely the kind of experimentation that separates OpenAI&amp;#x27;s frontier workers from the median.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biggest gaps show up in technical work that used to require specialists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest relative gaps between frontier and median workers appear in coding, writing, and analysis — precisely the task categories where AI capabilities have advanced most rapidly. Frontier workers are not just doing the same work faster; they appear to be doing different work entirely, expanding into technical domains that were previously inaccessible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/business/enterprise?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_B_SEM_GBR_Core_ENT_BAU_ACQ_PER_BRD_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_080625&amp;amp;utm_term=chatgpt%20enterprise&amp;amp;utm_content=182507886919&amp;amp;utm_ad=779434575253&amp;amp;utm_match=b&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22855802308&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-I0E5ew3OYocHAOSOiKw516uqob_&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiArt_JBhCTARIsADQZaykhZ9zJ10fojuPYA8XhHxR0jVT-WbgS4kfA7IIaTohf7yAByZszI-AaAkeREALw_wcB"&gt;ChatGPT Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; users outside of engineering, IT, and research, coding-related messages have grown 36 percent over the past six months. Someone in marketing or HR who learns to write scripts and automate workflows is becoming a categorically different employee than a peer who has not — even if they hold the same title and started with the same skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic research on AI and productivity offers a complicated picture. Several studies cited in the OpenAI report find that AI has an &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;equalizing effect&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; disproportionately helping lower-performing workers close the gap with their higher-performing peers. But the equalizing effect may apply only within the population of workers who actually use AI regularly. A meaningful share of workers are not in that group at all. They remain light users or non-users, even as their more adventurous colleagues pull away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Companies are divided too, and the gap is widening by the month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divide is not only between individual workers. It exists between entire organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier firms — those at the 95th percentile of adoption intensity — generate approximately twice as many AI messages per employee as the median enterprise. For messages routed through custom GPTs, purpose-built tools that automate specific workflows, the gap widens to seven-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers suggest fundamentally different operating models. At median companies, AI may be a productivity tool that individual workers use at their discretion. At frontier firms, AI appears to be embedded in core infrastructure: standardized workflows, persistent custom tools, systematic integration with internal data systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt; notes that roughly one in four enterprises still has not enabled connectors that give AI access to company data—a basic step that dramatically increases the technology&amp;#x27;s utility. The MIT study found that companies that purchased AI tools from specialized vendors succeeded &lt;a href="https://www.tekedia.com/the-genai-divide-mit-report-shows-why-most-business-ai-projects-are-stalling/"&gt;67 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the time, while internal builds had only a one-in-three success rate. For many organizations, the AI era has technically arrived but has not yet begun in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The technology is no longer the problem — organizations are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For executives, the data presents an uncomfortable challenge. The technology is no longer the constraint. OpenAI notes that it releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days; the models are advancing faster than most organizations can absorb. The bottleneck has shifted from what AI can do to whether organizations are structured to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The dividing line isn&amp;#x27;t intelligence,&amp;quot; the &lt;a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"&gt;MIT authors write&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with enterprise AI have to do with memory, adaptability, and learning capability. Problems stem less from regulations or model performance, and more from tools that fail to learn or adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading firms, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;OpenAI report&lt;/a&gt;, consistently invest in executive sponsorship, data readiness, workflow standardization, and deliberate change management. They build cultures where custom AI tools are created, shared, and refined across teams. They track performance and run evaluations. They make AI adoption a strategic priority rather than an individual choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest are leaving it to chance — hoping that workers will discover the tools on their own, experiment on their own time, and somehow propagate best practices without infrastructure or incentive. The six-fold gap suggests this approach is not working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The window to catch up is closing faster than most companies realize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enterprise contracts locking in over the next 18 months, there&amp;#x27;s a shrinking window for vendors and adopters to cross the divide.The GenAI Divide identified by the &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/7ef17d82-96bf-4dd1-9df2-228f7f377a29/the-state-of-enterprise-ai_2025-report.pdf"&gt;MIT report&lt;/a&gt; is not going to last forever. But the organizations that figure out a way across it soonest will be the ones that define the next era of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both reports carry caveats. The OpenAI data comes from a company with an obvious interest in promoting AI adoption. The productivity figures are self-reported by customers already paying for the product. The MIT study, while independent, relies on interviews and surveys rather than direct measurement. The long-term effects of this technology on employment, wages, and workplace dynamics remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the core finding — that access alone does not produce adoption, and that adoption varies enormously even within organizations that have made identical tools available to all — is consistent with how previous technologies have diffused through the economy. Spreadsheets, email, and the internet all created similar divides before eventually becoming universal. The question is how long the current gap persists, who benefits during the transition, and what happens to workers who find themselves on the wrong side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the divide is stark. Ninety percent of users said they prefer humans for &amp;quot;mission-critical work,&amp;quot; while AI has &amp;quot;won the war for simple work.&amp;quot; The workers who are pulling ahead are not doing so because they have access their colleagues lack. They are pulling ahead because they decided to use what everyone already has—and kept using it until they figured out what it could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6x gap is not about technology. It is about behavior. And behavior, unlike software, cannot be deployed with a company-wide rollout.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-report-reveals-a-6x-productivity-gap-between-ai-power-users-and</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The AI that scored 95% — until consultants learned it was AI (AI | VentureBeat)</title><link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-that-scored-95-until-consultants-learned-it-was-ai</link><description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Presented by SAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When SAP ran a quiet internal experiment to gauge consultant attitudes toward AI, the results were striking. Five teams were asked to validate answers to more than 1,000 business requirements completed by SAP’s AI co-pilot, Joule for Consultants — a workload that would normally take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four teams were told the analysis had been completed by junior interns fresh out of school. They reviewed the material, found it impressive, and rated the work about 95% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth team was told the very same answers had come from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They rejected almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when asked to validate each answer one by one did they discover that the AI was, in fact, highly accurate — surfacing detailed insights the consultants had initially dismissed. The overall accuracy? Again, about 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lesson learned here is that we need to be very cautious as we introduce AI — especially in how we communicate with senior consultants about its possibilities and how to integrate it into their workflows,” says Guillermo B. Vazquez Mendez, chief architect, RI business transformation and architecture, SAP America Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment has since become a revealing starting point for SAP’s push toward the consultant of 2030: a practitioner who is deeply human, enabled by AI, and no longer weighed down by the technical grunt work of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overcoming AI skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance isn’t surprising, Vazquez notes. Consultants with two or three decades of experience carry enormous institutional knowledge — and an understandable degree of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But AI copilots like Joule for Consultants are not replacing expertise. They’re amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What Joule really does is make their very expensive time far more effective,” Vazquez says. “It removes the clerical work, so they can focus on turning out high-quality answers in a fraction of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes this message constantly: “AI is not replacing you. It’s a tool for you. Human oversight is always required. But now, instead of spending your time looking for documentation, you’re gaining significant time and boosting the effectiveness and detail of your answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The consultant time-shift: from tech execution to business insight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, consultants spent about 80% of their time understanding technical systems — how processes run, how data flows, how functions execute. Customers, by contrast, spend 80% of their time focused on their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch is exactly where Joule steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a gap there — and the bridge is AI,” Vazquez says. “It flips the time equation, enabling consultants to invest more of their energy in understanding the customer’s industry and business goals. AI takes on the heavy technical lift, so consultants can focus on driving the right business outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bringing new consultants up to speed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is also transforming how new hires learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to see Joule acting as a bridge between senior consultants, who are adapting more slowly, and interns and new consultants who are already technically savvy,” Vazquez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior consultants ramp up faster because Joule helps them operate independently. Seniors, meanwhile, engage where their insight matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also where many consultants learn the fundamentals of today’s AI copilots. Much of the work depends on prompt engineering — for instance, instructing Joule to act as a senior chief technology architect specializing in finance and SAP S/4HANA 2023, then asking it to analyze business requirements and deliver the output as tables or PowerPoint slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they grasp how to frame prompts, consultants consistently get higher-quality, more structured answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New architects are also able to communicate more clearly with their more experienced counterparts. They know what they don’t know and can ask targeted questions, which makes mentorship far smoother. It’s created a real synergy, Vazquez adds — senior consultants see how quickly new hires are adapting and learning with AI, and that momentum encourages them to keep pace and adopt the technology themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking ahead to the future of AI copilots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still in the baby steps of AI — we’re toddlers,” Vazquez says. “Right now, copilots depend on prompt engineering to get good answers. The better you prompt, the better the answer you get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that represents only the earliest phase of what these systems will eventually do. As copilots mature, they’ll move beyond responding to prompts and start interpreting entire business processes — understanding the sequence of steps, identifying where human intervention is needed, and spotting where an AI agent could take over. That shift is what leads directly into agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP’s depth of process knowledge is what makes that evolution possible. The company has mapped more than 3,500 business processes across industries — a repository Vazquez calls “some of the most valuable, rigorously tested processes developed in the last 50 years.” Every day, SAP systems support roughly $7.3 trillion in global commerce, giving these emerging AI agents a rich foundation to navigate and reason over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With that level of process insight and data, we can take a real leap forward,” he says, “equipping our consultants with agentic AI that can solve complex challenges and push us toward increasingly autonomous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Developers have to patch together various connectors and keep them running, but that’s a fragile approach that’s hard to scale and creates governance headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google claims it’s trying to solve that by launching its own fully managed, remote MCP servers that would make its Google and Cloud services — like Maps and BigQuery — easier for agents to plug into.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The move follows the launch of Google’s latest Gemini 3 model, and the company is looking to pair stronger reasoning with more dependable connections to real-world tools and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We are making Google agent-ready by design,” Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of spending a week or two setting up connectors, developers can now essentially paste in a URL to a managed endpoint, Giannini said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At launch, Google is starting with MCP servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. In practice, this might look like an analytics assistant querying BigQuery directly, or an ops agent interacting with infrastructure services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered at no extra cost to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is Apigee, its API management product, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Giannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with existing security and governance controls layered on top.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2148009757.jpg?resize=1200,800" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;AI agents are being sold as the solution for planning trips, answering business questions, and solving problems of all kinds, but getting them to work with tools and data outside their chat interfaces has been tricky.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered at no extra cost to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;MCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is Apigee, its API management product, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Giannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with existing security and governance controls layered on top.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] Exclusive eBook: Aging Clocks &amp; Understanding Why We Age (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/10/1128999/exclusive-ebook-aging-clocks-understanding-why-we-age/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Longevity-Thumb.png?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contentBody__summaryBullets--81327c9379272772d1e74a64b6d4868a"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ebook is available only for subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses AI systems knows the frustration: a prompt is given, the response misses the mark, and the cycle repeats. This trial-and-error loop can feel unpredictable and discouraging. To address this, we are excited to introduce &lt;strong&gt;Promptions&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;prompt + options&lt;/em&gt;), a UI framework that helps developers build AI interfaces with more precise user control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its simple design makes it easy to integrate into any setting&amp;nbsp;that relies on added context, including customer support, education, and medicine. Promptions is available under the MIT license on Microsoft Foundry Labs&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions&amp;nbsp;builds on&amp;nbsp;our research,&amp;nbsp;“Dynamic Prompt Middleware: Contextual Prompt Refinement Controls for Comprehension Tasks.”&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;project&amp;nbsp;examined&amp;nbsp;how&amp;nbsp;knowledge&amp;nbsp;workers&amp;nbsp;use&amp;nbsp;generative AI when their goal is&amp;nbsp;to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; rather than&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;. While much public&amp;nbsp;discussion centers on&amp;nbsp;AI producing text&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;images, understanding involves asking AI to explain, clarify, or teach—a&amp;nbsp;task&amp;nbsp;that can&amp;nbsp;quickly become&amp;nbsp;complex. Consider a spreadsheet formula: one&amp;nbsp;user may want a&amp;nbsp;simple syntax&amp;nbsp;breakdown,&amp;nbsp;another a&amp;nbsp;debugging&amp;nbsp;guide, and&amp;nbsp;another an explanation suitable for&amp;nbsp;teaching&amp;nbsp;colleagues.&amp;nbsp;The same formula can require&amp;nbsp;entirely&amp;nbsp;different explanations depending on the user’s role, expertise, and goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A great deal of complexity sits beneath these&amp;nbsp;seemingly simple&amp;nbsp;requests.&amp;nbsp;Users&amp;nbsp;often&amp;nbsp;find&amp;nbsp;that the way&amp;nbsp;they phrase a question&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;match&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;level of detail the AI&amp;nbsp;needs.&amp;nbsp;Clarifying what they really want can require long, carefully worded&amp;nbsp;prompts that are tiring to produce.&amp;nbsp;And because the connection&amp;nbsp;between natural language and system behavior&amp;nbsp;isn’t always transparent, it can be difficult to predict&amp;nbsp;how the AI will interpret a&amp;nbsp;given&amp;nbsp;request.&amp;nbsp;In the end, users spend more time&amp;nbsp;managing the interaction itself&amp;nbsp;than understanding the material they&amp;nbsp;hoped&amp;nbsp;to learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identifying-how-users-want-to-guide-ai-outputs"&gt;Identifying&amp;nbsp;how users want to guide AI outputs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore why these&amp;nbsp;challenges&amp;nbsp;persist and how people can better steer AI toward customized results, we conducted two studies with knowledge workers across technical and nontechnical roles. Their experiences highlighted important gaps that guided Promptions’ design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our&amp;nbsp;first study&amp;nbsp;involved&amp;nbsp;38 professionals&amp;nbsp;across&amp;nbsp;engineering, research, marketing, and program management. Participants reviewed&amp;nbsp;design mock-ups that&amp;nbsp;provided&amp;nbsp;static&amp;nbsp;prompt-refinement&amp;nbsp;options—such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;start with&lt;/em&gt;—for shaping&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although these&amp;nbsp;static&amp;nbsp;options were helpful, they&amp;nbsp;couldn’t&amp;nbsp;adapt to the&amp;nbsp;specific formula, code snippets, or text&amp;nbsp;the participant&amp;nbsp;was trying to understand.&amp;nbsp;Participants&amp;nbsp;also wanted direct ways to&amp;nbsp;customize&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;tone,&amp;nbsp;detail, or&amp;nbsp;format of the response&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;having to&amp;nbsp;type instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-dynamic-refinement-matters"&gt;Why dynamic refinement matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;second study&amp;nbsp;tested&amp;nbsp;prototypes&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;controlled experiment.&amp;nbsp;We compared the static&amp;nbsp;design&amp;nbsp;from the first study, called&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;“Static Prompt Refinement Control”&amp;nbsp;(Static PRC),&amp;nbsp;against a&amp;nbsp;“Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control” (Dynamic PRC)&amp;nbsp;with features that&amp;nbsp;responded&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;participants’ feedback.&amp;nbsp;Sixteen&amp;nbsp;technical&amp;nbsp;professionals familiar with generative AI&amp;nbsp;completed six tasks,&amp;nbsp;spanning&amp;nbsp;code explanation,&amp;nbsp;understanding a&amp;nbsp;complex topic, and&amp;nbsp;learning a new&amp;nbsp;skill.&amp;nbsp;Each participant tested both systems, with task assignments balanced to ensure fair comparison.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comparing Dynamic PRC&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Static PRC&amp;nbsp;revealed key insights into how&amp;nbsp;dynamic&amp;nbsp;prompt-refinement&amp;nbsp;options change users’&amp;nbsp;sense of&amp;nbsp;control and exploration and&amp;nbsp;how those options&amp;nbsp;help them&amp;nbsp;reflect&amp;nbsp;on their understanding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="static-prompt-refinement"&gt;Static&amp;nbsp;prompt&amp;nbsp;refinement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Static PRC&amp;nbsp;offered a set of pre‑selected controls&amp;nbsp;(Figure 1)&amp;nbsp;identified&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;initial&amp;nbsp;study.&amp;nbsp;We expected these options to be useful&amp;nbsp;across many&amp;nbsp;types of&amp;nbsp;explanation-seeking&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text: The Static PRC interface in the user study. It includes dropdowns and radio buttons for selecting expertise level (Beginner to Advanced), explanation length (Short to Long), role of AI (Coach, Teach, Explain), explanation type (End result, Modular, Step-by-step), starting point (High-level or Detailed), and tone (Formal, Informal, Encouraging, Neutral)." class="wp-image-1157834" height="852" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig02-staticprc-1.png" width="1379" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;1: The static PRC&amp;nbsp;interface&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dynamic-prompt-refinement"&gt;Dynamic prompt refinement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We built the Dynamic PRC system to automatically produce prompt options and refinements based on the user’s input, presenting them in real time so that users could adjust these controls and guide the AI’s responses more precisely (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text: How users interacted with the Dynamic PRC system.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="findings"&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While participants valued Dynamic PRC’s adaptability, they also found it more difficult to interpret. Some struggled to anticipate how a selected option would influence the response, noting that the controls seemed opaque because the effect became clear only after the output appeared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;overall&amp;nbsp;positive response&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Dynamic PRC&amp;nbsp;showed us that Promptions&amp;nbsp;could&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;broadly useful,&amp;nbsp;leading&amp;nbsp;us to share it&amp;nbsp;with the developer community.   &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-design"&gt;Technical design&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions works as a lightweight middleware layer that sits between the user and the underlying language model (Figure 5). It has two main components:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option Module&lt;/strong&gt;. This module reviews the user’s prompt and conversation history, then generates a set of refinement options. These are presented as interactive UI elements (radio buttons, checkboxes, text fields) that directly shape how the AI interprets the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat&amp;nbsp;Module.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This module&amp;nbsp;produces the&amp;nbsp;AI’s response based&amp;nbsp;on the refined prompt.&amp;nbsp;When&amp;nbsp;a user changes an option,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;response&amp;nbsp;immediately&amp;nbsp;updates,&amp;nbsp;making the interaction feel more like an&amp;nbsp;evolving&amp;nbsp;conversation&amp;nbsp;than&amp;nbsp;a cycle of&amp;nbsp;repeated prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-promptions-to-an-application"&gt;Adding Promptions to an application&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions&amp;nbsp;easily&amp;nbsp;integrates&amp;nbsp;into&amp;nbsp;any conversational chat interface.&amp;nbsp;Developers only need to add a&amp;nbsp;component&amp;nbsp;to display the&amp;nbsp;options and connect it to the&amp;nbsp;AI system.&amp;nbsp;There’s&amp;nbsp;no need to store&amp;nbsp;date&amp;nbsp;between sessions, which keeps implementation simple.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Microsoft Foundry Labs&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;repository&amp;nbsp;includes&amp;nbsp;two sample applications,&amp;nbsp;a generic chatbot and an image generator,&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;demonstrate&amp;nbsp;this design in practice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions is well-suited for interfaces where users need to provide context but don’t want to write it all out. Instead of typing lengthy explanations, they can adjust the controls that guide the AI’s response to match their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-for-further-exploration"&gt;Questions for further exploration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions raises important questions for future research. Key usability challenges include clarifying how dynamic options affect AI output and managing the complexity of multiple controls. Other questions involve balancing immediate adjustments with persistent settings and enabling users to share options collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, questions focus on generating more effective options, validating and customizing dynamic interfaces, gathering relevant context automatically, and supporting the ability to save and share option sets across sessions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;These&amp;nbsp;questions, along with&amp;nbsp;broader&amp;nbsp;considerations&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;collaboration, ethics, security, and scalability,&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;guiding our ongoing work on&amp;nbsp;Promptions&amp;nbsp;and related systems.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;By making Promptions open source, we hope to help developers create smarter, more responsive AI experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explore Promptions on Microsoft Foundry Labs&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="sr-only" id="label-external-link"&gt;Opens in a new tab&lt;/span&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Three white line icons on a blue-to-green gradient background: a hub-and-spoke network symbol on the left, a laptop with a user icon in the center, and a connected group of three user icons on the right." class="wp-image-1157946" height="788" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Promptions-BlogHeroFeature-1400x788-1.jpg" width="1400" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses AI systems knows the frustration: a prompt is given, the response misses the mark, and the cycle repeats. This trial-and-error loop can feel unpredictable and discouraging. To address this, we are excited to introduce &lt;strong&gt;Promptions&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;prompt + options&lt;/em&gt;), a UI framework that helps developers build AI interfaces with more precise user control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its simple design makes it easy to integrate into any setting&amp;nbsp;that relies on added context, including customer support, education, and medicine. Promptions is available under the MIT license on Microsoft Foundry Labs&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt; and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Promptions&amp;nbsp;builds on&amp;nbsp;our research,&amp;nbsp;“Dynamic Prompt Middleware: Contextual Prompt Refinement Controls for Comprehension Tasks.”&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;project&amp;nbsp;examined&amp;nbsp;how&amp;nbsp;knowledge&amp;nbsp;workers&amp;nbsp;use&amp;nbsp;generative AI when their goal is&amp;nbsp;to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; rather than&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;. While much public&amp;nbsp;discussion centers on&amp;nbsp;AI producing text&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;images, understanding involves asking AI to explain, clarify, or teach—a&amp;nbsp;task&amp;nbsp;that can&amp;nbsp;quickly become&amp;nbsp;complex. Consider a spreadsheet formula: one&amp;nbsp;user may want a&amp;nbsp;simple syntax&amp;nbsp;breakdown,&amp;nbsp;another a&amp;nbsp;debugging&amp;nbsp;guide, and&amp;nbsp;another an explanation suitable for&amp;nbsp;teaching&amp;nbsp;colleagues.&amp;nbsp;The same formula can require&amp;nbsp;entirely&amp;nbsp;different explanations depending on the user’s role, expertise, and goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A great deal of complexity sits beneath these&amp;nbsp;seemingly simple&amp;nbsp;requests.&amp;nbsp;Users&amp;nbsp;often&amp;nbsp;find&amp;nbsp;that the way&amp;nbsp;they phrase a question&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;match&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;level of detail the AI&amp;nbsp;needs.&amp;nbsp;Clarifying what they really want can require long, carefully worded&amp;nbsp;prompts that are tiring to produce.&amp;nbsp;And because the connection&amp;nbsp;between natural language and system behavior&amp;nbsp;isn’t always transparent, it can be difficult to predict&amp;nbsp;how the AI will interpret a&amp;nbsp;given&amp;nbsp;request.&amp;nbsp;In the end, users spend more time&amp;nbsp;managing the interaction itself&amp;nbsp;than understanding the material they&amp;nbsp;hoped&amp;nbsp;to learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identifying-how-users-want-to-guide-ai-outputs"&gt;Identifying&amp;nbsp;how users want to guide AI outputs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explore why these&amp;nbsp;challenges&amp;nbsp;persist and how people can better steer AI toward customized results, we conducted two studies with knowledge workers across technical and nontechnical roles. Their experiences highlighted important gaps that guided Promptions’ design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our&amp;nbsp;first study&amp;nbsp;involved&amp;nbsp;38 professionals&amp;nbsp;across&amp;nbsp;engineering, research, marketing, and program management. Participants reviewed&amp;nbsp;design mock-ups that&amp;nbsp;provided&amp;nbsp;static&amp;nbsp;prompt-refinement&amp;nbsp;options—such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;start with&lt;/em&gt;—for shaping&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although these&amp;nbsp;static&amp;nbsp;options were helpful, they&amp;nbsp;couldn’t&amp;nbsp;adapt to the&amp;nbsp;specific formula, code snippets, or text&amp;nbsp;the participant&amp;nbsp;was trying to understand.&amp;nbsp;Participants&amp;nbsp;also wanted direct ways to&amp;nbsp;customize&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;tone,&amp;nbsp;detail, or&amp;nbsp;format of the response&amp;nbsp;without&amp;nbsp;having to&amp;nbsp;type instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-dynamic-refinement-matters"&gt;Why dynamic refinement matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;second study&amp;nbsp;tested&amp;nbsp;prototypes&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;controlled experiment.&amp;nbsp;We compared the static&amp;nbsp;design&amp;nbsp;from the first study, called&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;“Static Prompt Refinement Control”&amp;nbsp;(Static PRC),&amp;nbsp;against a&amp;nbsp;“Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control” (Dynamic PRC)&amp;nbsp;with features that&amp;nbsp;responded&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;participants’ feedback.&amp;nbsp;Sixteen&amp;nbsp;technical&amp;nbsp;professionals familiar with generative AI&amp;nbsp;completed six tasks,&amp;nbsp;spanning&amp;nbsp;code explanation,&amp;nbsp;understanding a&amp;nbsp;complex topic, and&amp;nbsp;learning a new&amp;nbsp;skill.&amp;nbsp;Each participant tested both systems, with task assignments balanced to ensure fair comparison.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comparing Dynamic PRC&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Static PRC&amp;nbsp;revealed key insights into how&amp;nbsp;dynamic&amp;nbsp;prompt-refinement&amp;nbsp;options change users’&amp;nbsp;sense of&amp;nbsp;control and exploration and&amp;nbsp;how those options&amp;nbsp;help them&amp;nbsp;reflect&amp;nbsp;on their understanding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="static-prompt-refinement"&gt;Static&amp;nbsp;prompt&amp;nbsp;refinement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Static PRC&amp;nbsp;offered a set of pre‑selected controls&amp;nbsp;(Figure 1)&amp;nbsp;identified&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;initial&amp;nbsp;study.&amp;nbsp;We expected these options to be useful&amp;nbsp;across many&amp;nbsp;types of&amp;nbsp;explanation-seeking&amp;nbsp;prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text: The Static PRC interface in the user study. It includes dropdowns and radio buttons for selecting expertise level (Beginner to Advanced), explanation length (Short to Long), role of AI (Coach, Teach, Explain), explanation type (End result, Modular, Step-by-step), starting point (High-level or Detailed), and tone (Formal, Informal, Encouraging, Neutral)." class="wp-image-1157834" height="852" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blog-fig02-staticprc-1.png" width="1379" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;1: The static PRC&amp;nbsp;interface&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dynamic-prompt-refinement"&gt;Dynamic prompt refinement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We built the Dynamic PRC system to automatically produce prompt options and refinements based on the user’s input, presenting them in real time so that users could adjust these controls and guide the AI’s responses more precisely (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text: How users interacted with the Dynamic PRC system.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="findings"&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants consistently reported that dynamic controls made it easier to express the nuances of their tasks without repeatedly rephrasing their prompts. This reduced the effort of prompt engineering and allowed users to focus more on understanding content than managing the mechanics of phrasing.&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond exploration, the dynamic controls prompted participants to think more deliberately about their goals. Options like “Learning Objective” and “Response Format” helped them clarify what they needed, whether guidance on applying a concept or step-by-step troubleshooting help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;News publishers participating in the pilot program include Der Spiegel, El País, Folha, Infobae, Kompas, The Guardian, The Times of India, The Washington Examiner, and The Washington Post, among others.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The purpose of the new commercial partnership program is to “explore how AI can drive more engaged audiences,” Google said in a blog post. As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications’ Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We’re doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of Google’s Wednesday announcement, the company said that it’s launching its “Preferred Sources” feature globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August. The feature allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In the coming days, the feature will be available for English-language users worldwide, and Google plans to roll it out to all supported languages early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google will now also highlight links from your news subscriptions and show these links in a dedicated carousel in the Gemini app in the coming weeks, with AI Overviews and AI Mode to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While these features make it easy for users to access news from their preferred sources, they also risk confining them to an ideological bubble that limits their exposure to different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Google also announced that it’s increasing the number of inline links in AI Mode.

          &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s decision to allow Nvidia to export an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, to China may give China exactly what it needs to win the AI race, experts and lawmakers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H200 is about 10 times less powerful than Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, which is the tech giant’s currently most advanced chip that cannot be exported to China. But the H200 is six times more powerful than the H20, the most advanced chip available in China today. Meanwhile China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, is estimated to be about two years behind Nvidia’s technology. By approving the sales, Trump may unwittingly be helping Chinese chip makers “catch up” to Nvidia, Jake Sullivan told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan, a former Biden-era national security advisor who helped design AI chip export curbs on China, told the NYT that Trump’s move was “nuts” because “China’s main problem” in the AI race “is they don’t have enough advanced computing capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It makes no sense that President Trump is solving their problem for them by selling them powerful American chips,” Sullivan said. “We are literally handing away our advantage. China’s leaders can’t believe their luck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump apparently was persuaded by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his “AI czar,” David Sacks, to reverse course on H200 export curbs. They convinced Trump that restricting sales would ensure that only Chinese chip makers would get a piece of China’s market, shoring up revenue flows that dominant firms like Huawei could pour into R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By instead allowing Nvidia sales, China’s industry would remain hooked on US chips, the thinking goes. And Nvidia could use those funds—perhaps $10–15 billion annually, Bloomberg Intelligence has estimated—to further its own R&amp;amp;D efforts. That cash influx, theoretically, would allow Nvidia to maintain the US advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the US would receive a 25 percent cut of sales, which lawmakers from both sides of the aisle warned may not be legal and suggested to foreign rivals that US national security was “now up for sale,” NYT reported. The president has claimed there are conditions to sales safeguarding national security but, frustrating critics, provided no details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts slam Nvidia plan as “flawed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s plan is “flawed,” The Economist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the US has established tech dominance by keeping advanced technology away from China. Trump risks rocking that boat by “tearing up America’s export-control policy,” particularly if China’s chip industry simply buys up the H200s as a short-term tactic to learn from the technology and beef up its domestic production of advanced chips, The Economist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign that’s exactly what many expect could happen, investors in China were apparently so excited by Trump’s announcement that they immediately poured money into Moore Threads, expected to be China’s best answer to Nvidia, the South China Morning Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several experts for the non-partisan think tank the Counsel on Foreign Relations also criticized the policy change, cautioning that the reversal of course threatened to undermine US competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggesting that Trump was “effectively undoing” export curbs sought during his first term, Zongyuan Zoe Liu warned that China “buys today to learn today, with the intention to build tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps more concerning, she suggested, is that Trump’s policy signals weakness. Rather than forcing Chinese dependence on US tech, reversing course showed China that the US will “back down” under pressure, she warned. And they’re getting that message at a time when “Chinese leaders have a lot of reasons to believe they are not only winning the trade war but also making progress towards a higher degree of strategic autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

      
      &lt;div class="dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50"&gt;

            &lt;div class="ad ad--rail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ad-wrapper-inner"&gt;

      &lt;div class="relative lg:col-span-2"&gt;

        
        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, Rush Doshi—a CFR expert who previously advised Biden on national security issues related to China—suggested that the policy change was “possibly decisive in the AI race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compute is our main advantage—China has more power, engineers, and the entire edge layer—so by giving this up, we increase the odds the world runs on Chinese AI,” Doshi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts fear Trump may not understand the full impact of his decision. In the short-term, Michael C. Horowitz wrote for CFR, “it is indisputable” that allowing H200 exports benefits China’s frontier AI and efforts to scale data centers. And Doshi pointed out that Trump’s shift may trigger more advanced technology flowing into China, as US allies that restricted sales of machines to build AI chips may soon follow his lead and lift their curbs. As China learns to be self-reliant from any influx of advanced tech, Sullivan warned that China’s leaders “intend to get off of American semiconductors as soon as they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, the argument that we can keep them ‘addicted’ holds no water,” Sullivan said. “They want American chips right now for one simple reason: They are behind in the AI race, and this will help them catch up while they build their own chip capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China may reject H200, demand Blackwell access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear if China will approve H200 sales, but some of the country’s biggest firms, including ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, are interested, anonymous insider sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, China has instructed companies to avoid Nvidia, warning of possible backdoors giving Nvidia a kill switch to remotely shut down chips. Such backdoors could potentially destabilize Chinese firms’ operations and R&amp;amp;D. Nvidia has denied such backdoors exist, but Chinese firms have supposedly sought reassurances from Nvidia in the aftermath of Trump’s policy change. Likely just as unpopular with the Chinese firms and government, Nvidia confirmed recently that it has built location verification tech that could help the US detect when restricted chips are leaked into China. Should the US ever renew export curbs on H200 chips, adopting them widely could cause chaos in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without giving China sought-after reassurances, Nvidia may not end up benefiting as much as it hoped from its mission to reclaim lost revenue from the Chinese market. Today, Chinese firms control about 60 percent of China’s AI chip market, where only a few years ago American firms—led by Nvidia—controlled 80 percent, the Economist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for China, the temptation to buy up Nvidia chips may be too great to pass up. Another CFR expert, Chris McGuire, estimated that Nvidia could suddenly start exporting as many as 3 million H200s into China next year. “This would at least triple the amount of aggregate AI computing power China could add domestically” in 2026, McGuire wrote, and possibly trigger disastrous outcomes for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could cause DeepSeek and other Chinese AI developers to close the gap with leading US AI labs and enable China to develop an ‘AI Belt and Road’ initiative—a complement to its vast global infrastructure investment network already in place—that competes with US cloud providers around the world,” McGuire forecasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As China mulls the benefits and risks, an emergency meeting was called, where the Chinese government discussed potential concerns of local firms buying chips, according to The Information. Reportedly, Beijing ended that meeting with a promise to issue a decision soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz suggested that a primary reason that China may reject the H200s could be to squeeze even bigger concessions out of Trump, whose administration recently has been working to maintain a tenuous truce with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China could come back demanding the Blackwell or something else,” Horowitz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Nvidia—which plans to release a chip called the Rubin to surpass the Blackwell soon—praised Trump’s policy as striking “a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China will rip off Nvidia’s chips, Republican warns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress criticized Trump’s plan, including senators behind a bipartisan push to limit AI chip sales to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have questioned how much thought was put into the policy, as the US confusingly continues restricting less advanced AI chips (like the A100 and H100) while green-lighting H200 sales. Trump’s Justice Department also seems to be struggling to keep up. The NYT noted that just “hours before” Trump announced the policy change, the DOJ announced “it had detained two people for selling those chips to the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chair of the Select Committee on Competition with China, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), warned on X that the news wouldn’t be good for the US or Nvidia. First, the Chinese Communist Party “will use these highly advanced chips to strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” he suggested. And second, “Nvidia should be under no illusions—China will rip off its technology, mass produce it themselves, and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is China’s playbook and it is using it in every critical industry,” Moolenaar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Democrats on committees dealing with foreign affairs and competition with China echoed those concerns, The Hill reported, warning that “under this administration, our national security is for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s Huang seems pleased with the outcome, which comes after months of reportedly pressuring the administration to lift export curbs limiting its growth in Chinese markets, the NYT reported. Last week, Trump heaped praise on Huang after one meeting, calling Huang a “smart man” and suggesting the Nvidia chief has “done an amazing job” helping Trump understand the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an October news conference ahead of the deal’s official approval, Huang suggested that government lawyers were researching ways to get around a US law that prohibits charging companies fees for export licenses. Eventually, Trump is expected to release a policy that outlines how the US will collect those fees without conflicting with that law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats appear unlikely to embrace such a policy, issuing a joint statement condemning the H200 sales as dooming the US in the AI race and threatening national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Access to these chips would give China’s military transformational technology to make its weapons more lethal, carry out more effective cyberattacks against American businesses and critical infrastructure and strengthen their economic and manufacturing sector,” Senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s decision to allow Nvidia to export an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, to China may give China exactly what it needs to win the AI race, experts and lawmakers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H200 is about 10 times less powerful than Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, which is the tech giant’s currently most advanced chip that cannot be exported to China. But the H200 is six times more powerful than the H20, the most advanced chip available in China today. Meanwhile China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, is estimated to be about two years behind Nvidia’s technology. By approving the sales, Trump may unwittingly be helping Chinese chip makers “catch up” to Nvidia, Jake Sullivan told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan, a former Biden-era national security advisor who helped design AI chip export curbs on China, told the NYT that Trump’s move was “nuts” because “China’s main problem” in the AI race “is they don’t have enough advanced computing capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It makes no sense that President Trump is solving their problem for them by selling them powerful American chips,” Sullivan said. “We are literally handing away our advantage. China’s leaders can’t believe their luck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump apparently was persuaded by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his “AI czar,” David Sacks, to reverse course on H200 export curbs. They convinced Trump that restricting sales would ensure that only Chinese chip makers would get a piece of China’s market, shoring up revenue flows that dominant firms like Huawei could pour into R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By instead allowing Nvidia sales, China’s industry would remain hooked on US chips, the thinking goes. And Nvidia could use those funds—perhaps $10–15 billion annually, Bloomberg Intelligence has estimated—to further its own R&amp;amp;D efforts. That cash influx, theoretically, would allow Nvidia to maintain the US advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the US would receive a 25 percent cut of sales, which lawmakers from both sides of the aisle warned may not be legal and suggested to foreign rivals that US national security was “now up for sale,” NYT reported. The president has claimed there are conditions to sales safeguarding national security but, frustrating critics, provided no details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts slam Nvidia plan as “flawed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s plan is “flawed,” The Economist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the US has established tech dominance by keeping advanced technology away from China. Trump risks rocking that boat by “tearing up America’s export-control policy,” particularly if China’s chip industry simply buys up the H200s as a short-term tactic to learn from the technology and beef up its domestic production of advanced chips, The Economist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign that’s exactly what many expect could happen, investors in China were apparently so excited by Trump’s announcement that they immediately poured money into Moore Threads, expected to be China’s best answer to Nvidia, the South China Morning Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several experts for the non-partisan think tank the Counsel on Foreign Relations also criticized the policy change, cautioning that the reversal of course threatened to undermine US competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggesting that Trump was “effectively undoing” export curbs sought during his first term, Zongyuan Zoe Liu warned that China “buys today to learn today, with the intention to build tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps more concerning, she suggested, is that Trump’s policy signals weakness. Rather than forcing Chinese dependence on US tech, reversing course showed China that the US will “back down” under pressure, she warned. And they’re getting that message at a time when “Chinese leaders have a lot of reasons to believe they are not only winning the trade war but also making progress towards a higher degree of strategic autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, Rush Doshi—a CFR expert who previously advised Biden on national security issues related to China—suggested that the policy change was “possibly decisive in the AI race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compute is our main advantage—China has more power, engineers, and the entire edge layer—so by giving this up, we increase the odds the world runs on Chinese AI,” Doshi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts fear Trump may not understand the full impact of his decision. In the short-term, Michael C. Horowitz wrote for CFR, “it is indisputable” that allowing H200 exports benefits China’s frontier AI and efforts to scale data centers. And Doshi pointed out that Trump’s shift may trigger more advanced technology flowing into China, as US allies that restricted sales of machines to build AI chips may soon follow his lead and lift their curbs. As China learns to be self-reliant from any influx of advanced tech, Sullivan warned that China’s leaders “intend to get off of American semiconductors as soon as they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, the argument that we can keep them ‘addicted’ holds no water,” Sullivan said. “They want American chips right now for one simple reason: They are behind in the AI race, and this will help them catch up while they build their own chip capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China may reject H200, demand Blackwell access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear if China will approve H200 sales, but some of the country’s biggest firms, including ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, are interested, anonymous insider sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, China has instructed companies to avoid Nvidia, warning of possible backdoors giving Nvidia a kill switch to remotely shut down chips. Such backdoors could potentially destabilize Chinese firms’ operations and R&amp;amp;D. Nvidia has denied such backdoors exist, but Chinese firms have supposedly sought reassurances from Nvidia in the aftermath of Trump’s policy change. Likely just as unpopular with the Chinese firms and government, Nvidia confirmed recently that it has built location verification tech that could help the US detect when restricted chips are leaked into China. Should the US ever renew export curbs on H200 chips, adopting them widely could cause chaos in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Another CFR expert, Chris McGuire, estimated that Nvidia could suddenly start exporting as many as 3 million H200s into China next year. “This would at least triple the amount of aggregate AI computing power China could add domestically” in 2026, McGuire wrote, and possibly trigger disastrous outcomes for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could cause DeepSeek and other Chinese AI developers to close the gap with leading US AI labs and enable China to develop an ‘AI Belt and Road’ initiative—a complement to its vast global infrastructure investment network already in place—that competes with US cloud providers around the world,” McGuire forecasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress criticized Trump’s plan, including senators behind a bipartisan push to limit AI chip sales to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have questioned how much thought was put into the policy, as the US confusingly continues restricting less advanced AI chips (like the A100 and H100) while green-lighting H200 sales. Trump’s Justice Department also seems to be struggling to keep up. The NYT noted that just “hours before” Trump announced the policy change, the DOJ announced “it had detained two people for selling those chips to the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chair of the Select Committee on Competition with China, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), warned on X that the news wouldn’t be good for the US or Nvidia. First, the Chinese Communist Party “will use these highly advanced chips to strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” he suggested. And second, “Nvidia should be under no illusions—China will rip off its technology, mass produce it themselves, and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is China’s playbook and it is using it in every critical industry,” Moolenaar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Democrats on committees dealing with foreign affairs and competition with China echoed those concerns, The Hill reported, warning that “under this administration, our national security is for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s Huang seems pleased with the outcome, which comes after months of reportedly pressuring the administration to lift export curbs limiting its growth in Chinese markets, the NYT reported. Last week, Trump heaped praise on Huang after one meeting, calling Huang a “smart man” and suggesting the Nvidia chief has “done an amazing job” helping Trump understand the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an October news conference ahead of the deal’s official approval, Huang suggested that government lawyers were researching ways to get around a US law that prohibits charging companies fees for export licenses. Eventually, Trump is expected to release a policy that outlines how the US will collect those fees without conflicting with that law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats appear unlikely to embrace such a policy, issuing a joint statement condemning the H200 sales as dooming the US in the AI race and threatening national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Access to these chips would give China’s military transformational technology to make its weapons more lethal, carry out more effective cyberattacks against American businesses and critical infrastructure and strengthen their economic and manufacturing sector,” Senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
