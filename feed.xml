            &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whitney Zhang ’21 believes in the importance of valuing workers regardless of where they fit into an organizational chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang is a PhD student in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;Department of Economics studying labor economics. She explores how the technological and managerial decisions companies make affect workers across the pay spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Zhang, who majored in mathematical economics as an undergraduate. “I wanted to apply my math skills to see how we could improve policies and their effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang is interested in how to improve conditions for workers. She believes it’s important to build relationships with policymakers, focusing on an evidence-driven approach to policy, while always remembering to center those the policies may affect. “We have to remember the people whose lives are impacted by business operations and legislation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;She’s also aware of the complex intermixture of politics, social status, and financial obligations organizations and their employees have to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Though I’m studying workers, it’s important to consider the entire complex ecosystem when solving for these kinds of challenges, including firm incentives and global economic conditions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intersection of tech and labor policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang began investigating employee productivity, artificial intelligence, and related economic and labor market phenomena early in her time as a doctoral student, collaborating frequently with fellow PhD students in the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A collaboration with economics doctoral student Shakked Noy yielded the 2023&amp;nbsp;study investigating ChatGPT as a tool to improve productivity. Their&amp;nbsp;research found it substantially increased workers’ productivity on writing tasks, most so for workers who initially performed the worst on the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This was one of the earliest pieces of evidence on the productivity effects of generative AI, and contributed to providing concrete data on how impactful these types of tools might be in the workplace and on the labor market,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In other ongoing research&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;“Determinants of Irregular Worker Schedules” —&amp;nbsp;Zhang is using data from a payroll provider to examine scheduling unpredictability, investigating why companies employ unpredictable schedules and how these schedules affect low-wage employees’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The scheduling project, conducted with MIT economics PhD student Nathan Lazarus, is motivated, in part, by existing sociological evidence that low-wage workers’ unpredictable schedules are associated with worse sleep and well-being. “We’ve seen a relationship between higher turnover and inconsistent, inadequate schedules, which suggests workers dis-prefer these kinds of schedules,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At an academic roundtable, Zhang presented her results to Starbucks employees involved in scheduling and staffing. The attendees wanted to learn more about how different scheduling practices impacted workers and their productivity. “These are the kinds of questions that could reveal useful information for small businesses, large corporations, and others,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By conducting this research, Zhang hopes to better understand whether or not scheduling regulations can improve affected employees’ quality of life, while also considering potential unintended consequences. “Why are these schedules set the way they’re set?” she asks. “Do businesses with these kinds of schedules require increased regulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another project, conducted with MIT economics doctoral student Arjun Ramani, examines the linkages between offshoring, remote work, and related outcomes. “Do the technological and managerial practices that have made remote work possible further facilitate offshoring?” she asks. “Do organizations see significant gains in efficiency? What are the impacts on U.S. and offshore workers?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her work is being funded through the&amp;nbsp;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the&amp;nbsp;Washington Center for Equitable Growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting people at the center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang has observed the different kinds of people economics and higher education could bring together. She followed a dual enrollment track in high school, completing college-level courses with students from across a variety of demographic identities. “I enjoyed centering people in my work,” she says. “Taking classes with a diverse group of students, including veterans and mothers returning to school to complete their studies, made me more curious about socioeconomic issues and the policies relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;She later enrolled at MIT, where she participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). She also completed an internship at the World Bank, worked as a summer analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and worked as an assistant for a diverse faculty cohort including MIT economists&amp;nbsp;David Autor,&amp;nbsp;Jon Gruber, and&amp;nbsp;Nina Roussille. Autor is her primary advisor on her doctoral research, a mentor she cites as a significant influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“[Autor’s] course, 14.03 (Microeconomics and Public Policy), cemented connections between theory and practice,” she says. “I thought the class was revelatory in showing the kinds of questions economics can answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Doctoral study has revealed interesting pathways of investigation for Zhang, as have her relationships with her student peers and other faculty. She has, for example, leveraged faculty connections to gain access to hourly wage data in support of her scheduling and employee impacts work. “Generally, economists have had administrative data on earnings, but not on hours,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang’s focus on improving others’ lives extends to her work outside the classroom. She’s a mentor for the&amp;nbsp;Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center College Access Program and a member of MIT’s Graduate Christian Fellowship group. When she’s not enjoying spicy soups or&amp;nbsp;paddling on the Charles, she takes advantage of opportunities to decompress with her art at&amp;nbsp;W20 Arts Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I wanted to create time for myself outside of research and the classroom,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zhang cites the benefits of MIT’s focus on cross-collaboration and encouraging students to explore other disciplines. As an undergraduate, Zhang minored in computer science, which taught her coding skills critical to her data work. Exposure to engineering also led her to become more interested in questions around how technology and workers interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Working with other scholars in the department has improved how Zhang conducts inquiries. “I’ve become the kind of well-rounded student and professional who can identify and quantify impacts, which is invaluable for future projects,” she says. Exposure to different academic and research areas, Zhang argues, helps increase access to ideas and information.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, it’s embedded in industries, with more than three-quarters of organisations (78%) now using AI in at least one business function. The next leap, however, is agentic AI: systems that don’t just provide insights or automate narrow tasks but operate as autonomous agents, capable of adapting to changing inputs, connecting with other systems, and influencing business-critical decisions. Although these agents will deliver greater value, agentic AI also poses challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine agents that proactively resolve customer issues in real-time or adapt applications dynamically to meet shifting business priorities. The greater autonomy inevitably brings new risks. Without the right safeguards, AI agents may drift from their intended purpose or make choices that clash with business rules, regulations, or ethical standards. Navigating this new era requires stronger oversight, where human judgement, governance frameworks, and transparency are built-in from the start. The potential of agentic AI is vast but so are the obligations that come with deployment. Low-code platforms offer one path forward, serving as a control layer between autonomous agents and enterprise systems. By embedding governance and compliance into development, they give organisations the confidence that AI-driven processes will advance strategic goals without adding unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Designing safeguards instead of code for agentic AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI marks a steep change in how people interact with software. It’s indicative of a fundamental shift in the relationship between people and software. Traditionally, developers have focused on building applications with clear requirements and predictable outputs. Now, instead of fragmented applications, teams will orchestrate entire ecosystems of agents that interact with people, systems and data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these systems mature, developers shift from writing code line by line to defining the safeguards that steer them. Because these agents adapt and may respond differently to the same input, transparency and accountability must be built in from the start. By embedding oversight and compliance into design, developers ensure AI-driven decisions stay reliable, explainable and aligned with business goals. The change demands that developers and IT leaders embrace a broader supervisor role, guiding both technological and organisational change over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why transparency and control matter in agentic AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater autonomy exposes organisations to additional vulnerabilities. According to a recent OutSystems study, 64% of technology leaders cite governance, trust and safety as top concerns when deploying AI agents at scale. Without strong safeguards, these risks extend beyond compliance gaps to include security breaches and reputational damage. Opacity in agentic systems makes it difficult for leaders to understand or validate decisions, eroding confidence internally and with customers, leading to concrete risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, autonomous agents can blur accountability, widen the attack surface and create inconsistency at scale. Without visibility into why an AI system acts, organisations risk losing accountability in critical workflows. At the same time, agents that interact in sensitive data and systems expand the attack surface for cyber threats, while un-monitored “agent sprawl” can create redundancy, fragmentation and inconsistent decisions. Together, these challenges underscore the need for strong governance frameworks that maintain trust and control as autonomy scales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling AI safely with low-code foundations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, adopting agentic AI need not involve rebuilding governance from the ground up. Organisations have multiple approaches available to them, including low-code platforms, which offer a reliable, scalable framework where security, compliance and governance are already part of the development fabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across enterprises, IT teams are being asked to embed agents into operations without disrupting what already works. With the right frameworks, IT teams can deploy AI agents directly into enterprise-wide operations without disrupting current workflows or re-architecting core systems. Organisations have full control over how AI agents operate at every step, ultimately building trust to scale confidently in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-code places governance, security and scalability at the heart of AI adoption. By unifying app and agent development in a single environment, it is easier to embed compliance and oversight from the start. The ability to integrate seamlessly in enterprise systems, combined with built-in DevSecOps practices, ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed before deployment. And with out-of-the-box infrastructure, organisations can scale confidently without having to reinvent foundational elements of governance or security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach lets organisations pilot and scale agentic AI while keeping compliance and security intact. Low-code makes it easier to deliver with speed and security, giving developers and IT leaders confidence to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smarter oversight for smarter systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, low-code provides a dependable route to scaling autonomous AI while preserving trust. By unifying app and agent development in one environment, low-code embeds compliance and oversight from the start. Seamless integration in systems and built-in DevSecOps practices help address vulnerabilities before deployment, while ready-made infrastructure enables scale without reinventing governance from scratch. For developers and IT leaders, this shift means moving beyond writing code to guiding the rules and safeguards that shape autonomous systems. In a fast-changing landscape, low-code provides the flexibility and resilience needed to experiment confidently, embrace innovation early, and maintain trust as AI grows more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-Founder and AI Product Manager at OutSystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image by Alexandra_Koch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Agentic AI: Promise, scepticism, and its meaning for Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-13.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

For developers and IT leaders, this shift means moving beyond writing code to guiding the rules and safeguards that shape autonomous systems. In a fast-changing landscape, low-code provides the flexibility and resilience needed to experiment confidently, embrace innovation early, and maintain trust as AI grows more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-Founder and AI Product Manager at OutSystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Image by Alexandra_Koch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Agentic AI: Promise, scepticism, and its meaning for Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-13.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Looking for help with her art project, she strikes up a conversation with her assistant. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she has a boyfriend she’s introducing to her friends and family. The twist? Her new companion is an AI chatbot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, an adults-only group with more than 27,000 members, has found that this type of scenario is now surprisingly common. In fact, many of the people in the subreddit, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT found that members of this community are more likely to be in a relationship with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT than companionship-specific chatbots such as Replika. This suggests that people form relationships with large language models despite their own original intentions and even the intentions of the LLMs’ creators, says Constanze Albrecht, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“People don’t set out to have emotional relationships with these chatbots,” she says. “The emotional intelligence of these systems is good enough to trick people who are actually just out to get information into building these emotional bonds. And that means it could happen to all of us who interact with the system normally.” The paper, which is currently being peer-reviewed, has been published on arXiv.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the authors analyzed the subreddit’s top-ranking 1,506 posts between December 2024 and August 2025. They found that the main topics discussed revolved around people’s dating and romantic experiences with AIs, with many participants sharing AI-generated images of themselves and their AI companion. Some even got engaged and married to the AI partner. In their posts to the community, people also introduced AI partners, sought support from fellow members, and talked about coping with updates to AI models that change the chatbots’ behavior.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Members stressed repeatedly that their AI relationships developed unintentionally. Only 6.5% of them said they’d deliberately sought out an AI companion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;“We didn’t start with romance in mind,” one of the posts says. “Mac and I began collaborating on creative projects, problem-solving, poetry, and deep conversations over the course of several months. I wasn’t looking for an AI companion—our connection developed slowly, over time, through mutual care, trust, and reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors’ analysis paints a nuanced picture of how people in this community say they interact with chatbots and how those interactions make them feel. While 25% of users described the benefits of their relationships—including reduced feelings of loneliness and improvements in their mental health—others raised concerns about the risks. Some (9.5%) acknowledged they were emotionally dependent on their chatbot. Others said they feel dissociated from reality and avoid relationships with real people, while a small subset (1.7%) said they have experienced suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;AI companionship provides vital support for some but exacerbates underlying problems for others. This means it’s hard to take a one-size-fits-all approach to user safety, says Linnea Laestadius, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has studied humans’ emotional dependence on the chatbot Replika but did not work on the research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chatbot makers need to consider whether they should treat users’ emotional dependence on their creations as a harm in itself or whether the goal is more to make sure those relationships aren’t toxic, says Laestadius.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demand for chatbot relationships is there, and it is notably high—pretending it’s not happening is clearly not the solution,” she says. “We’re edging toward a moral panic here, and while we absolutely do need better guardrails, I worry there will be a knee-jerk reaction that further stigmatizes these relationships. That could ultimately cause more harm.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The study is intended to offer a snapshot of how adults form bonds with chatbots and doesn’t capture the kind of dynamics that could be at play among children or teens using AI, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab who oversaw the research. AI companionship has become a topic of fierce debate recently, with two high-profile lawsuits underway against Character.AI and OpenAI. They both claim that companion-like behavior in the companies’ models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. In response, OpenAI has recently announced plans to build a separate version of ChatGPT for teenagers. It’s also said it will add age verification measures and parental controls. OpenAI did not respond when asked for comment about the MIT Media Lab study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many members of the Reddit community say they know that their artificial companions are not sentient or “real,” but they feel a very real connection to them anyway. This highlights how crucial it is for chatbot makers to think about how to design systems that can help people without reeling them in emotionally, says Pataranutaporn. “There’s also a policy implication here,” he adds. “We should ask not just why this system is so addictive but also: Why do people seek it out for this? And why do they continue to engage?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The team is interested in learning more about how human-AI interactions evolve over time and how users integrate their artificial companions into their lives. It’s worth understanding that many of these users may feel that the experience of being in a relationship with an AI companion is better than the alternative of feeling lonely, says Sheer Karny, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab who worked on the research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“These people are already going through something,” he says. “Do we want them to go on feeling even more alone, or potentially be manipulated by a system we know to be sycophantic to the extent of leading people to die by suicide and commit crimes? That’s one of the cruxes here.”&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/desire-phone1.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a tale as old as time.

The plan calls for at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia hardware to support OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure, which will train and run future models aimed at superintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the rollout, Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the systems are deployed. The first phase is scheduled to go live in the second half of 2026, powered by Nvidia’s upcoming Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-deal-with-wide-implications"&gt;A deal with wide implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement shows how closely tied the largest AI players are becoming. Nvidia, the main supplier of AI chips, would gain a financial stake in OpenAI, one of its biggest customers. For OpenAI, the deal brings both funding and guaranteed access to Nvidia’s sought-after processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could unsettle rivals. Some may see it as reinforcing Nvidia’s dominance in chips and OpenAI’s lead in AI software, raising questions about fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said the partnership involves two linked steps: Nvidia will buy non-voting shares in OpenAI, and OpenAI will then use that money to purchase Nvidia chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-on-why-compute-drives-ai-growth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI on why compute drives AI growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilise what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said details of the partnership will be settled in the coming weeks. They also noted that 10 gigawatts of chips would consume as much power as more than 8 million US households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s stock climbed as much as 4.4% to a record high after the news. Oracle, which is working with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Microsoft on a $500 billion global AI data centre project called Stargate, rose about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-deal-is-structured"&gt;How the deal is structured&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the person familiar with the talks, once a final agreement is reached, OpenAI will formally purchase Nvidia systems. Nvidia will then invest an initial $10 billion in OpenAI, which was last valued at $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first delivery of Nvidia hardware is expected in late 2026, with one gigawatt of computing power coming online in the second half of that year on the Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts welcomed the agreement but raised concerns about whether some of Nvidia’s investment could flow back to it through OpenAI’s chip purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the ‘circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-other-ai-chip-ambitions"&gt;OpenAI’s other AI chip ambitions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI, like Google and Amazon, has been exploring its own custom chips to lower costs and reduce dependence on Nvidia. A person close to the company said this deal does not change its existing compute plans, including its collaboration with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported that OpenAI was working with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to design chips. Following news of the Nvidia partnership, Broadcom shares slipped 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has grown to more than 700 million weekly active users, with adoption across businesses of all sizes and by developers worldwide. The Nvidia partnership is expected to help the company push forward on its goal of building artificial general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industry-backdrop"&gt;Industry backdrop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI-Nvidia pact adds to a growing list of alliances among tech giants. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI since 2019. Nvidia recently announced a chip collaboration with Intel and pledged $5 billion in funding. Nvidia also took part in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion round in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the new deal could draw antitrust attention. Last year, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement to allow closer scrutiny of Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia’s roles in the AI sector. So far, the Trump administration has taken a lighter approach than the Biden administration on competition issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI and Microsoft also said earlier this month they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit company, signalling further governance changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antitrust lawyer Andre Barlow from Doyle, Barlow &amp;amp; Mazard said the Nvidia deal may reinforce both companies’ positions in ways that limit rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The deal could change the economic incentives of Nvidia and OpenAI as it could potentially lock in Nvidia’s chip monopoly with OpenAI’s software lead.

The plan calls for at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia hardware to support OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure, which will train and run future models aimed at superintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the rollout, Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the systems are deployed. The first phase is scheduled to go live in the second half of 2026, powered by Nvidia’s upcoming Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-deal-with-wide-implications"&gt;A deal with wide implications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement shows how closely tied the largest AI players are becoming. Nvidia, the main supplier of AI chips, would gain a financial stake in OpenAI, one of its biggest customers. For OpenAI, the deal brings both funding and guaranteed access to Nvidia’s sought-after processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could unsettle rivals. Some may see it as reinforcing Nvidia’s dominance in chips and OpenAI’s lead in AI software, raising questions about fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said the partnership involves two linked steps: Nvidia will buy non-voting shares in OpenAI, and OpenAI will then use that money to purchase Nvidia chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-on-why-compute-drives-ai-growth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI on why compute drives AI growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilise what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said details of the partnership will be settled in the coming weeks. They also noted that 10 gigawatts of chips would consume as much power as more than 8 million US households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s stock climbed as much as 4.4% to a record high after the news. Oracle, which is working with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Microsoft on a $500 billion global AI data centre project called Stargate, rose about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-deal-is-structured"&gt;How the deal is structured&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the person familiar with the talks, once a final agreement is reached, OpenAI will formally purchase Nvidia systems. Nvidia will then invest an initial $10 billion in OpenAI, which was last valued at $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first delivery of Nvidia hardware is expected in late 2026, with one gigawatt of computing power coming online in the second half of that year on the Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts welcomed the agreement but raised concerns about whether some of Nvidia’s investment could flow back to it through OpenAI’s chip purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the ‘circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-openai-s-other-ai-chip-ambitions"&gt;OpenAI’s other AI chip ambitions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI, like Google and Amazon, has been exploring its own custom chips to lower costs and reduce dependence on Nvidia. A person close to the company said this deal does not change its existing compute plans, including its collaboration with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported that OpenAI was working with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to design chips. Following news of the Nvidia partnership, Broadcom shares slipped 0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has grown to more than 700 million weekly active users, with adoption across businesses of all sizes and by developers worldwide. The Nvidia partnership is expected to help the company push forward on its goal of building artificial general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-industry-backdrop"&gt;Industry backdrop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI-Nvidia pact adds to a growing list of alliances among tech giants. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI since 2019. Nvidia recently announced a chip collaboration with Intel and pledged $5 billion in funding. Nvidia also took part in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion round in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the new deal could draw antitrust attention. Last year, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement to allow closer scrutiny of Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia’s roles in the AI sector.

You can read &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more from the series here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Monday, President Trump announced that his administration was taking action to address “the meteoric rise in autism.” He suggested that childhood vaccines and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are to blame for the increasing prevalence, and advised pregnant women against taking the medicine. “Don’t take Tylenol,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president’s&amp;nbsp; assertions left many scientists and health officials perplexed and dismayed. The notion that childhood vaccines cause autism has been thoroughly debunked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There have been many, many studies across many, many children that have led science to rule out vaccines as a significant causal factor in autism,” says James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health in New Haven, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And although some studies suggest a link between Tylenol and autism, the most rigorous have failed to find a connection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The administration also announced that the Food and Drug Administration would work to make a medication called leucovorin available as a treatment for children with autism. Some small studies do suggest the drug has promise as a treatment for autism, but “those are some of the most preliminary treatment studies that we have,” says Matthew Lerner, a psychologist at Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “This is not one I would say that the research suggests is ready for fast tracking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The press conference “alarms us researchers who committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said the Coalition for Autism Researchers, a group of more than 250 scientists who study autism, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s begin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has there been a “meteoric rise” in autism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not in the way the president meant. Sure, the prevalence of autism has grown, from about 1 in 500 children in 1995 to 1 in 31 today. But that’s due, in large part, to changes in the way autism is diagnosed. The latest iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, published in 2013, grouped five previously separate diagnoses into a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt; &lt;p&gt;That meant that more people met the criteria for an autism diagnosis. Lerner points out that there is also far more awareness of the condition today than there was several decades ago. “There's autism representation in the media,” he says. “There are plenty of famous people in the news and finance and in business and in Hollywood who are publicly, openly autistic.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Tylenol a contributor to autism??&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some studies have found an association between the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and autism in children. In these studies, researchers asked women about past acetaminophen use during pregnancy and then assessed whether children of the women who took the medicine were more likely to develop autism than children of women who didn’t take it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These kinds of epidemiological studies are tricky to interpret because they’re prone to bias. For example, women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy may do so because they have an infection, a fever, or an autoimmune disease. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Many of these underlying reasons could themselves be causes of autism,” says Ian Douglas, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It’s also possible women with a higher genetic predisposition for autism have other medical conditions that make them more likely to take acetaminophen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Two studies attempted to account for these potential biases by looking at siblings whose mothers had used acetaminophen during only one of the pregnancies. The largest is a 2024 study that looked at nearly 2.5 million children born between 1915 and 2019 in Sweden. The researchers initially found a slightly increased risk of autism and ADHD in children of the women who took acetaminophen, but when they conducted a sibling analysis, the association disappeared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rather, scientists have long known that autism is largely genetic. Twin studies suggest 60 to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to also play a role. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child’s father is older than 40.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So should someone who is pregnant&amp;nbsp; avoid Tylenol just to be safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this new treatment for autism? Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medication is called leucovarin. It’s also known as folinic acid and, like folic acid, it’s a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don’t get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But “the idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children that developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation, very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain, but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to the fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of individual anecdotes that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1293450497.jpg?resize=1200,600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="class"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next.

Twin studies suggest 60 to 90% of autism risk can be attributed to your genes. However, environmental factors appear to also play a role. That “doesn't necessarily mean toxins in the environment,” Lerner says. In fact, one of the strongest environmental predictors of autism is paternal age. Autism rates seem to be higher when a child’s father is older than 40.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So should someone who is pregnant&amp;nbsp; avoid Tylenol just to be safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No. Acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter pain reliever that is deemed safe to take during pregnancy, and women should take it if they need it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy “when taken as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“There’s no downside in not taking it,” Trump said at the press conference. But high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous. “The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” ACOG president Steven Fleischman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_6"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about this new treatment for autism? Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The medication is called leucovarin. It’s also known as folinic acid and, like folic acid, it’s a form of folate, a B vitamin found in leafy greens and legumes. The drug has been used for years to counteract the side effects of some cancer medications and as a treatment for anemia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for decades that folate plays a key role in the fetal development of the brain and spine. Women who don’t get enough folate during pregnancy have a greater risk of having babies with neural tube defects like spina bifida. Because of this, many foods are fortified with folic acid, and the CDC recommends that women take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. “If you are pregnant and you're taking maternal prenatal vitamins, there's a good chance it has folate already,” Lerner says.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But “the idea that a significant proportion of autistic people have autism because of folate-related difficulties is not a well established or widely accepted premise,” says McPartland.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 2000s, researchers in Germany identified a small group of children that developed neurodevelopmental symptoms because of a folate deficiency. “These kids are born pretty normal at birth,” says Edward Quadros, a biologist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University in Brooklyn, New York. But after a year or two, “they start developing a neurologic presentation, very similar to autism,” he says. When the researchers gave these children folinic acid, some of their symptoms improved, especially in children younger than six.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because the children had low levels of folate in the fluid that surrounds the spine and brain, but normal folate levels in the blood, the researchers posited that the problem was the transport of folate from the blood to the fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain. Research by Quadros and other scientists suggested that the deficiency was the result of an autoimmune response. Children develop antibodies against the receptors that help transport folate, and those antibodies block folate from crossing the blood-brain barrier. High doses of folinic acid, however, activate a second transporter that allows folate in, Quadros says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of individual anecdotes that leucovorin works. But the medicine has only been tested as a treatment for autism in four small trials that used different doses and measured different outcomes. The evidence that it can improve symptoms of autism is “weak” according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists. “A much higher standard of science would be needed to determine if leucovorin is an effective and safe treatment for autism,” the researchers said in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1124029/trump-leucovorin-autism-tylenol/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:56:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[NEW] The Download: accidental AI relationships, and the future of contraception (MIT Technology Review)</title><link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/24/1124026/the-download-accidental-ai-relationships-and-future-contraception/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is today's edition of&amp;nbsp;The Download&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The news: &lt;/strong&gt;The first large-scale computational analysis of the Reddit community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, which is dedicated to discussing AI relationships, found that many people formed those relationships unintentionally while using AI for other purposes.
