But Amodei is far from alone in sharing aloud that he foresees a workforce bloodbath. A new WSJ story highlights how other CEOs are also issuing dire predictions about AI’s job impact, turning employment doom into something of a competitive sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Several of these predictions came before Amodei’s comments. For example, at JPMorgan’s annual investor day earlier in May, its consumer banking chief Marianne Lake projected AI would “enable” a 10% workforce reduction. But they’ve been coming fast, and growing more stark, ever since. In a note last month, Amazon’s Andy Jassy warned employees to expect a smaller workforce due to the “once-in-a-lifetime” technological shift that’s afoot. ThredUp’s CEO said at a conference last month that AI will destroy “way more jobs than the average person thinks.” Not to be outdone, Ford’s Jim Farley delivered perhaps the most sweeping claim yet, saying last week that AI will “literally replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a dramatic shift from executives’ previous cautious public statements about job displacement, notes the Journal.

At its I/O 2025 event in May, for example, the company showed off a digital assistant that didn’t just answer questions; it helped work on a bicycle repair by finding a matching user manual, locating a YouTube tutorial, and even calling a local store to ask about a part, all with minimal human nudging. Such capabilities could soon extend far outside the Google ecosystem. The company has introduced an open standard called Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, which aims to let agents from different companies talk to each other and work together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The vision is exciting: Intelligent software agents that act like digital coworkers, booking your flights, rescheduling meetings, filing expenses, and talking to each other behind the scenes to get things done. But if we’re not careful, we’re going to derail the whole idea before it has a chance to deliver real benefits. As with many tech trends, there’s a risk of hype racing ahead of reality. And when expectations get out of hand, a backlash isn’t far behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the term “agent” itself. Right now, it’s being slapped on everything from simple scripts to sophisticated AI workflows. There’s no shared definition, which leaves plenty of room for companies to market basic automation as something much more advanced. That kind of “agentwashing” doesn’t just confuse customers; it invites disappointment. We don’t necessarily need a rigid standard, but we do need clearer expectations about what these systems are supposed to do, how autonomously they operate, and how reliably they perform.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And reliability is the next big challenge. Most of today’s agents are powered by large language models (LLMs), which generate probabilistic responses. These systems are powerful, but they’re also unpredictable. They can make things up, go off track, or fail in subtle ways—especially when they’re asked to complete multistep tasks, pulling in external tools and chaining LLM responses together. A recent example: Users of Cursor, a popular AI programming assistant, were told by an automated support agent that they couldn’t use the software on more than one device. There were widespread complaints and reports of users canceling their subscriptions. But it turned out the policy didn’t exist. The AI had invented it.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In enterprise settings, this kind of mistake could create immense damage. We need to stop treating LLMs as standalone products and start building complete systems around them—systems that account for uncertainty, monitor outputs, manage costs, and layer in guardrails for safety and accuracy. These measures can help ensure that the output adheres to the requirements expressed by the user, obeys the company’s policies regarding access to information, respects privacy issues, and so on. Some companies, including AI21 (which I cofounded and which has received funding from Google), are already moving in that direction, wrapping language models in more deliberate, structured architectures. Our latest launch, Maestro, is designed for enterprise reliability, combining LLMs with company data, public information, and other tools to ensure dependable outputs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, even the smartest agent won’t be useful in a vacuum. For the agent model to work, different agents need to cooperate (booking your travel, checking the weather, submitting your expense report) without constant human supervision. That’s where Google’s A2A protocol comes in. It’s meant to be a universal language that lets agents share what they can do and divide up tasks. In principle, it’s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, A2A still falls short. It defines how agents talk to each other, but not what they actually mean. If one agent says it can provide “wind conditions,” another has to guess whether that’s useful for evaluating weather on a flight route. Without a shared vocabulary or context, coordination becomes brittle. We’ve seen this problem before in distributed computing. Solving it at scale is far from trivial.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also the assumption that agents are naturally cooperative. That may hold inside Google or another single company’s ecosystem, but in the real world, agents will represent different vendors, customers, or even competitors. For example, if my travel planning agent is requesting price quotes from your airline booking agent, and your agent is incentivized to favor certain airlines, my agent might not be able to get me the best or least expensive itinerary. Without some way to align incentives through contracts, payments, or game-theoretic mechanisms, expecting seamless collaboration may be wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of these issues are insurmountable. Shared semantics can be developed. Protocols can evolve. Agents can be taught to negotiate and collaborate in more sophisticated ways. But these problems won’t solve themselves, and if we ignore them, the term “agent” will go the way of other overhyped tech buzzwords. Already, some CIOs are rolling their eyes when they hear it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That’s a warning sign. We don’t want the excitement to paper over the pitfalls, only to let developers and users discover them the hard way and develop a negative perspective on the whole endeavor. That would be a shame. The potential here is real. But we need to match the ambition with thoughtful design, clear definitions, and realistic expectations. If we can do that, agents won’t just be another passing trend; they could become the backbone of how we get things done in the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoav Shoham is a professor emeritus at Stanford University and cofounder of AI21 Labs.

The company announced that it’s signed an agreement to purchase electricity from a fusion company’s forthcoming first power plant. Google also released its latest environmental report, which shows that &lt;strong&gt;its energy use from data centers has &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; since 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taken together, these two bits of news offer a fascinating look at just how desperately big tech companies are hunting for clean electricity to power their data centers as energy demand and emissions balloon in the age of AI. Of course, we don’t know exactly how much of this pollution is attributable to AI because Google doesn’t break that out. (Also a problem!) So, what’s next and what does this all mean?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with fusion: Google’s deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems is intended to provide the tech giant with 200 megawatts of power. This will come from Commonwealth’s first commercial plant, a facility planned for Virginia that the company refers to as the Arc power plant. The agreement represents half its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s important to note here is that this power plant doesn’t exist yet. In fact, Commonwealth still needs to get its Sparc demonstration reactor, located outside Boston, up and running. That site, which I visited in the fall, should be completed in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(An aside: This isn’t the first deal between Big Tech and a fusion company. Microsoft signed an agreement with Helion a couple of years ago to buy 50 megawatts of power from a planned power plant, scheduled to come online in 2028. Experts expressed skepticism in the wake of that deal, as my colleague James Temple reported.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Google’s announcement is a big moment for fusion, in part because of the size of the commitment and also because Commonwealth, a spinout company from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is seen by many in the industry as a likely candidate to be the first to get a commercial plant off the ground. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Google leadership was very up-front about the length of the timeline. “We would certainly put this in the long-term category,” said Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, in a press call about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news of Google’s foray into fusion comes just days after the tech giant’s release of its latest environmental report. While the company highlighted some wins, some of the numbers in this report are eye-catching, and not in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google’s emissions have increased by over 50% since 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, rising 6% in the last year alone. That’s decidedly the wrong direction for a company that’s set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that the company has committed billions to clean energy projects, including big investments in next-generation technologies like advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal systems. Those deals have helped dampen emissions growth, but it’s an arguably impossible task to keep up with the energy demand the company is seeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s electricity consumption from data centers was up 27% from the year before. It’s &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; since 2020, reaching over 30 terawatt-hours. &lt;strong&gt;That’s nearly the annual electricity consumption from the entire country of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an outsider, it’s tempting to point the finger at AI, since that technology has crashed into the mainstream and percolated into every corner of Google’s products and business. And yet the report downplays the role of AI. Here’s one bit that struck me:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“However, it’s important to note that our growing electricity needs aren’t solely driven by AI. The accelerating growth of Google Cloud, continued investments in Search, the expanding reach of YouTube, and more, have also contributed to this overall growth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is enough wiggle room in that statement to drive a large electric truck through. When I asked about the relative contributions here, company representative Mara Harris said via email that they don’t break out what portion comes from AI. When I followed up asking if the company didn’t have this information or just wouldn’t share it, she said she’d check but didn’t get back to me.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I’ll make the point here that we’ve made before, including in our recent package on AI and energy: &lt;strong&gt;Big companies should be disclosing more about the energy demands of AI. We shouldn’t be guessing at this technology’s effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google has put a ton of effort and resources into setting and chasing ambitious climate goals. But as its energy needs and those of the rest of the industry continue to explode, it’s obvious that this problem is getting tougher, and it’s also clear that more transparency is a crucial part of the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

So, what’s next and what does this all mean?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap alignleft"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with fusion: Google’s deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems is intended to provide the tech giant with 200 megawatts of power. This will come from Commonwealth’s first commercial plant, a facility planned for Virginia that the company refers to as the Arc power plant. The agreement represents half its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What’s important to note here is that this power plant doesn’t exist yet. In fact, Commonwealth still needs to get its Sparc demonstration reactor, located outside Boston, up and running. That site, which I visited in the fall, should be completed in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;(An aside: This isn’t the first deal between Big Tech and a fusion company. Microsoft signed an agreement with Helion a couple of years ago to buy 50 megawatts of power from a planned power plant, scheduled to come online in 2028. Experts expressed skepticism in the wake of that deal, as my colleague James Temple reported.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Google’s announcement is a big moment for fusion, in part because of the size of the commitment and also because Commonwealth, a spinout company from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is seen by many in the industry as a likely candidate to be the first to get a commercial plant off the ground. (&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Google leadership was very up-front about the length of the timeline. “We would certainly put this in the long-term category,” said Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, in a press call about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The news of Google’s foray into fusion comes just days after the tech giant’s release of its latest environmental report. While the company highlighted some wins, some of the numbers in this report are eye-catching, and not in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google’s emissions have increased by over 50% since 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, rising 6% in the last year alone. That’s decidedly the wrong direction for a company that’s set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that the company has committed billions to clean energy projects, including big investments in next-generation technologies like advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal systems. Those deals have helped dampen emissions growth, but it’s an arguably impossible task to keep up with the energy demand the company is seeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s electricity consumption from data centers was up 27% from the year before. It’s &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; since 2020, reaching over 30 terawatt-hours. &lt;strong&gt;That’s nearly the annual electricity consumption from the entire country of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an outsider, it’s tempting to point the finger at AI, since that technology has crashed into the mainstream and percolated into every corner of Google’s products and business. And yet the report downplays the role of AI. Here’s one bit that struck me:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“However, it’s important to note that our growing electricity needs aren’t solely driven by AI. The accelerating growth of Google Cloud, continued investments in Search, the expanding reach of YouTube, and more, have also contributed to this overall growth.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is enough wiggle room in that statement to drive a large electric truck through. When I asked about the relative contributions here, company representative Mara Harris said via email that they don’t break out what portion comes from AI. When I followed up asking if the company didn’t have this information or just wouldn’t share it, she said she’d check but didn’t get back to me.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;I’ll make the point here that we’ve made before, including in our recent package on AI and energy: &lt;strong&gt;Big companies should be disclosing more about the energy demands of AI. We shouldn’t be guessing at this technology’s effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Google has put a ton of effort and resources into setting and chasing ambitious climate goals. But as its energy needs and those of the rest of the industry continue to explode, it’s obvious that this problem is getting tougher, and it’s also clear that more transparency is a crucial part of the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from The Spark, &lt;/em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;em&gt;’s weekly climate newsletter.

 &lt;p&gt;There has been a trend toward lowering the bar for new medicines, and it is becoming easier for people to access treatments that might not help them—and could even harm them. Anecdotes appear to be overpowering evidence in decisions on drug approval.

Such capabilities could soon extend far outside the Google ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision is exciting: Intelligent software agents that act like digital coworkers, booking your flights, rescheduling meetings, filing expenses, and talking to each other behind the scenes to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we’re not careful, we’re going to derail the whole idea before it has a chance to deliver real benefits. As with many tech trends, there’s a risk of hype racing ahead of reality. And when expectations get out of hand, a backlash isn’t far behind. Read the full story.&lt;/p&gt; 
   &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google’s electricity demand is skyrocketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We got two big pieces of energy news from Google this week. The company announced that it’s signed an agreement to purchase electricity from a fusion company’s forthcoming first power plant. Google also released its latest environmental report, which shows that its energy use from data centers has doubled since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taken together, these two bits of news offer a fascinating look at just how desperately big tech companies are hunting for clean electricity to power their data centers as energy demand and emissions balloon in the age of AI. Of course, we don’t know exactly how much of this pollution is attributable to AI because Google doesn’t break that out. (Also a problem!) So, what’s next and what does this all mean?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Casey Crownhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

 &lt;p&gt;There has been a trend toward lowering the bar for new medicines, and it is becoming easier for people to access treatments that might not help them—and could even harm them. Anecdotes appear to be overpowering evidence in decisions on drug approval. As a result, we’re ending up with some drugs that don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We urgently need to question how these decisions are made. Who should have access to experimental therapies?
