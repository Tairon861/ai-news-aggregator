&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The semiconductor giant revealed AMD Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, its latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.&lt;/p&gt;

The numbers tell a stark story. Average enterprise AI spending is forecasted at US$85,521 monthly in 2025, up 36% from 2024, according to CloudZero’s&amp;nbsp;research&amp;nbsp;surveying 500 engineering professionals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisations&amp;nbsp;planning to invest over US$100,000 monthly more than doubled from 20% in 2024 to 45% in 2025—not because AI became more valuable, but because component costs and deployment timelines spiralled beyond initial projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-export-controls-reshape-chip-access"&gt;Export controls reshape chip access&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s December 2025 decision to allow conditional sales of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China—the most powerful AI chip ever approved for export—illustrated how quickly semiconductor policy can shift. The arrangement requires a 25% revenue share with the US government and applies only to approved Chinese buyers, reversing an earlier April 2025 export freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the policy reversal came too late to prevent widespread disruption. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick testified that China’s Huawei will produce only 200,000 AI chips in 2025, while China legally imported around one million downgraded Nvidia chips designed specifically for export compliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production gap forced Chinese companies into large-scale smuggling operations—federal prosecutors unsealed documents in December revealing a ring that attempted to export at least US$160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs between October 2024 and May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global enterprises, these restrictions created unpredictable procurement challenges. Companies with China-based operations or data centres faced sudden access limitations, while others discovered their global deployment plans assumed chip availability that geopolitics no longer guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-chip-crisis-compounds-ai-infrastructure-pain"&gt;Memory chip crisis compounds AI infrastructure pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While export controls dominated headlines, a deeper supply crisis emerged: memory chips became the binding constraint on AI infrastructure globally. High-bandwidth memory (HBM), the&amp;nbsp;specialised&amp;nbsp;memory that enables AI accelerators to function, hit severe shortages as manufacturers Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron operated near full capacity while reporting six-to twelve-month lead times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory prices surged accordingly. DRAM prices climbed over 50% in 2025 in some categories, with server contract prices up as much as 50% quarterly, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/em&gt;. Samsung reportedly lifted prices for server memory chips by 30% to 60%. The firm forecasts memory prices to continue rising another 20% in early 2026 as demand continues outpacing capacity expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shortage wasn’t limited to&amp;nbsp;specialised&amp;nbsp;AI components. DRAM supplier inventories fell to two to four weeks by October 2025, down from 13-17 weeks in late 2024, per TrendForce data cited by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. SK Hynix told analysts that shortages may persist until late 2027, reporting that all memory scheduled for 2026 production is already sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI labs experienced this firsthand. Major cloud providers Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta issued open-ended orders to Micron, stating they will take as much inventory as the company can provide. Chinese firms Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance pressed Samsung and SK Hynix for priority access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure extended into future years, with OpenAI signing preliminary agreements with Samsung and SK Hynix for its Stargate project requiring up to 900,000 wafers monthly by 2029—roughly double today’s global monthly HBM output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deployment-timelines-stretch-beyond-projections"&gt;Deployment timelines stretch beyond projections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI chip shortage didn’t just increase costs—it fundamentally altered enterprise deployment timelines. Enterprise-level custom AI solutions that typically required six to twelve months for full deployment in early 2025 stretched to 12-18 months or longer by year-end, according to industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bain &amp;amp; Company partner Peter Hanbury, speaking to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, noted utility connection timelines have become the biggest constraint on data centre growth, with some projects facing five-year delays just to secure electricity access. The firm forecasts a 163GW rise in global data centre electricity demand by 2030, much of it linked to generative AI’s intensive compute requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella captured the paradox in stark terms: “The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but its power—it’s the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power. If you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can’t plug in. In fact, that is my problem today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional tech buyers in enterprise environments faced even steeper challenges. “Buyers in this environment will have to over-extend and make some bets now to secure supply later,” warned Chad Bickley of Bain &amp;amp; Company in a March 2025 analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Planning ahead for delays in production may require buyers to take on some expensive inventory of bleeding-edge technology products that may become obsolete in short order.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hidden-costs-compound-budget-pressures"&gt;Hidden costs compound budget pressures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visible price increases—HBM up 20-30% year-over-year, GPU cloud costs rising 40-300% depending on region—represented only part of the total cost impact.&amp;nbsp;Organisations&amp;nbsp;discovered multiple hidden expense categories that vendor quotes hadn’t captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced packaging capacity emerged as a critical bottleneck. TSMC’s CoWoS packaging, essential for stacking HBM alongside AI processors, was fully booked through the end of 2025. Demand for this integration technique exploded as wafer production increased, creating a secondary choke point that added months to delivery timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure costs beyond chips escalated sharply. Enterprise-grade NVMe SSDs saw prices climb 15-20% compared to a year earlier as AI workloads required significantly higher endurance and bandwidth than traditional applications.&amp;nbsp;Organisations&amp;nbsp;planning AI deployments found their bill-of-materials costs rising 5-10% from memory component increases alone, according to Bain analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation and governance costs compounded further.&amp;nbsp;Organisations&amp;nbsp;spent US$50,000 to US$250,000 annually on monitoring, governance, and enablement infrastructure beyond core licensing fees. Usage-based overages caused monthly charges to spike unexpectedly for teams with high AI interaction density, particularly those engaging in heavy model training or frequent inference workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-lessons-for-2026-and-beyond"&gt;Strategic lessons for 2026 and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise leaders who successfully navigated 2025’s AI chip shortage emerged with hard-won insights that will shape procurement strategy for years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify supply relationships early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Organizations&amp;nbsp;that secured long-term supply agreements with multiple vendors before shortages intensified maintained more predictable deployment timelines than those relying on spot procurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget for component volatility:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The era of stable, predictable infrastructure pricing has ended for AI workloads. CTOs learned to build 20-30% cost buffers into AI infrastructure budgets to absorb memory price fluctuations and component availability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimise&amp;nbsp;before scaling:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Techniques like model&amp;nbsp;quantisation, pruning, and inference&amp;nbsp;optimisation&amp;nbsp;cut GPU needs by 30-70% in some implementations.&amp;nbsp;Organisations&amp;nbsp;that invested in efficiency before throwing hardware at problems achieved better economics than those focused purely on procurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider hybrid infrastructure models:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Multi-cloud strategies and hybrid setups combining cloud GPUs with dedicated clusters improved reliability and cost predictability. For high-volume AI workloads, owning or leasing infrastructure increasingly proved more cost-effective than renting cloud GPUs at inflated spot prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor geopolitics into architecture decisions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The rapid policy shifts around chip exports taught enterprises that global AI infrastructure can’t assume stable regulatory environments. Organisations with China exposure learned to design deployment architectures with regulatory flexibility in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-2026-outlook-continued-constraints"&gt;The 2026 outlook: Continued constraints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supply-demand imbalance shows no signs of resolving quickly. New memory chip factories take years to build—most capacity expansions announced in 2025 won’t come online until 2027 or later. SK Hynix guidance suggests shortages persisting through at least late 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export control policy remains fluid. A new “Trump AI Controls” rule to replace earlier frameworks is expected later in 2025, along with potential controls on exports to Malaysia and Thailand identified as diversion routes for China. Each policy shift creates new procurement uncertainties for global enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The macroeconomic implications extend beyond IT budgets. Memory shortages could delay hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure investment, slowing productivity gains that enterprises have bet on to justify massive AI spending. Rising component costs threaten to add inflationary pressure at a moment when global economies remain sensitive to price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, 2025’s AI chip shortage delivered a definitive lesson: software moves at digital speed, but hardware moves at physical speed, and geopolitics moves at political speed. The gap between those three timelines defines what’s actually deployable—regardless of what vendors promise or roadmap projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisations that thrived weren’t those with the biggest budgets or the most ambitious AI visions. They were the ones who understood that in 2025, supply chain reality trumped strategic ambition—and planned accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Igor Omilaev/Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Can the US really enforce a global AI chip ban?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111442" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

CTOs learned to build 20-30% cost buffers into AI infrastructure budgets to absorb memory price fluctuations and component availability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimise&amp;nbsp;before scaling:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Techniques like model&amp;nbsp;quantisation, pruning, and inference&amp;nbsp;optimisation&amp;nbsp;cut GPU needs by 30-70% in some implementations.&amp;nbsp;Organisations&amp;nbsp;that invested in efficiency before throwing hardware at problems achieved better economics than those focused purely on procurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider hybrid infrastructure models:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Multi-cloud strategies and hybrid setups combining cloud GPUs with dedicated clusters improved reliability and cost predictability. For high-volume AI workloads, owning or leasing infrastructure increasingly proved more cost-effective than renting cloud GPUs at inflated spot prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor geopolitics into architecture decisions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The rapid policy shifts around chip exports taught enterprises that global AI infrastructure can’t assume stable regulatory environments. Organisations with China exposure learned to design deployment architectures with regulatory flexibility in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-2026-outlook-continued-constraints"&gt;The 2026 outlook: Continued constraints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supply-demand imbalance shows no signs of resolving quickly. New memory chip factories take years to build—most capacity expansions announced in 2025 won’t come online until 2027 or later. SK Hynix guidance suggests shortages persisting through at least late 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export control policy remains fluid. A new “Trump AI Controls” rule to replace earlier frameworks is expected later in 2025, along with potential controls on exports to Malaysia and Thailand identified as diversion routes for China. Each policy shift creates new procurement uncertainties for global enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The macroeconomic implications extend beyond IT budgets. Memory shortages could delay hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure investment, slowing productivity gains that enterprises have bet on to justify massive AI spending. Rising component costs threaten to add inflationary pressure at a moment when global economies remain sensitive to price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise leaders, 2025’s AI chip shortage delivered a definitive lesson: software moves at digital speed, but hardware moves at physical speed, and geopolitics moves at political speed. The gap between those three timelines defines what’s actually deployable—regardless of what vendors promise or roadmap projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisations that thrived weren’t those with the biggest budgets or the most ambitious AI visions. They were the ones who understood that in 2025, supply chain reality trumped strategic ambition—and planned accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Igor Omilaev/Unsplash)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Can the US really enforce a global AI chip ban?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-111442" height="90" src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png" width="728" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check outAI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

At the same time, teams are expected to turn agreements around faster and keep every signed obligation visible after signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is becoming a practical layer in this process. It can read language at scale, pull key terms into structured fields, highlight unusual clauses, and support quicker hand-offs between legal departments and the business. Five tools stand out in completing these processes efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-a-contract-management-provider-a-good-choice"&gt;What makes a contract management provider a good choice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a contract management service is partly a software decision and partly a long-term operating commitment. Contract processes change as the business evolves, so the right provider needs to support iterations, integration and adoption in teams. Tools that deliver will have certain minimum capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; A good platform can adapt to users’ unique workflows and scale with a business as the contract volume and complexity grow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User adoption focus:&lt;/strong&gt; The interface should be intuitive for all types of users, covering legal, sales and procurement teams, to ensure company-wide adoption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and support:&lt;/strong&gt; Look for providers with proven security credentials and a reputation for excellent training and client support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration ecosystem:&lt;/strong&gt; The tool must connect seamlessly with a company’s existing software stack to ensure smooth data flow and a single source of truth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-best-ai-powered-tools-for-managing-contracts"&gt;The best AI-powered tools for managing contracts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five tools stand out based on four criteria. These are contract AI capabilities in daily workflows, ease of rollout for legal and business users, integration readiness, and how well each supports post-signature work, like reporting, renewals and obligation tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="h-1-agiloft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Agiloft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agiloft has established a reputation in contract life cycle management (CLM) for its configurability and approach to treating data as an asset. That matters in real environments where sales, procurement, finance and legal all need different views of the same agreement, and where approvals and clause positions shift over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the AI side, Agiloft’s AI Core extracts and analyses contract data in the life cycle, helping teams turn documents into searchable fields and automation triggers. It also uses its own ConvoAI, a conversational experience for asking questions about the contract repository in natural language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its no-code model is also commendable. Contract teams routinely need to adjust intake forms, approval routing, renewal steps and reporting fields. No-code configuration reduces dependence on IT tickets for daily workflow updates. It also emphasises integrations that connect CLM platforms to systems used by other businesses, as outlined in offerings like its Integration Hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="h-2-ironclad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ironclad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironclad is a strong fit for teams that want contracting to feel approachable for the business. Legal may own the guardrails, but sales and procurement usually own the urgency. The company has invested heavily in keeping negotiation, approvals and version management inside one workspace, so the process does not fracture into email threads and scattered attachments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironclad’s AI Assist is designed to accelerate review by flagging risky or off-standard clauses and helping legal focus on the parts that truly need judgement. It also leans into repeatable processes, like templates, workflows and structured steps for drafting through signature. When those are used consistently, AI review becomes more effective because the system sees similar patterns in many agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="h-3-icertis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Icertis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icertis is built for enterprise complexity. Global users often need contracting to support multiple regions and languages, layered approval guidelines and integrations that connect contract commitments to other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its core concept is contract intelligence through the Icertis Contract Intelligence platform, which aims to connect terms to business processes. This way, obligations and entitlements do not stay trapped in PDFs. Another notable feature is its depth of integration. Enterprise contract teams tend to care less about where contracts are stored and more about whether renewals, price holds, compliance terms and supplier obligations can be reflected in the systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="h-4-linksquares"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. LinkSquares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LinkSquares shines in post-signature contract work. A company can have a solid signature process and still struggle when leadership asks for a portfolio view of renewals, indemnity positions, liability caps or security commitments in vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It uses AI to read executed agreements and extract key information into fields that can be searched and reported. Its Smart Values feature is a concrete example. It pulls common terms, dates and clause types, so legal teams can monitor them in large sets of agreements without manual tagging. Instead of opening dozens of documents to answer a single stakeholder request, teams can search in the database and generate reports that support the needs of various teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="h-5-contractpodai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. ContractPodAi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ContractPodAi is positioned as a broader legal platform with CLM at the centre, aiming to cover drafting, review, repository management and reporting in one place. It is often evaluated by teams looking for a single system for legal operations workflows, along with contract life cycle steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notable AI element is Leah, a generative AI legal assistant that supports summarisation and review-oriented help, among other tasks. Used well, this kind of assistant can speed up intake triage and help prepare quick summaries for business owners, while legal retains responsibility for final decisions. The tool also has clause detection and risk analysis capabilities, as well as dashboards for monitoring obligations after signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-the-top-ai-tools-for-contract-management"&gt;Comparing the top AI tools for contract management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an at-a-glance look at each provider’s key features and strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key AI feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Agiloft&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Conversational AI (ConvoAI)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No-code capability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;High-growth companies needing flexibility&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ironclad&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Automated clause review (AI Assist)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;User-friendly workflow automation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Teams prioritising ease of use and collaboration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Icertis&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enterprise-wide data connectivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enterprise-scale and ERP integration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Large, global enterprises&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;LinkSquares&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Post-signature data extraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Powerful search and analytics&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;In-house legal teams needing post-signature analysis&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ContractPodAi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Generative AI legal assistant (Leah)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;End-to-end life cycle automation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mid-to-large companies wanting an all-in-one legal hub&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-right-ai-clm-for-better-visibility-and-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the right AI CLM for better visibility and control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract AI pays off when it reduces repetition, keeps executed terms searchable, and makes renewals and obligations easier to manage in the business.

To get stories like this in your inbox first,&amp;nbsp;sign up here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes AI feels like a niche topic to write about, but then the holidays happen, and I hear relatives of all ages talking about cases of chatbot-induced psychosis, blaming rising electricity prices on data centers, and asking whether kids should have unfettered access to AI. It’s everywhere, in other words. And people are alarmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inevitably, these conversations take a turn: AI is having all these ripple effects &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but if the technology gets better, what happens next? That’s usually when they look at me, expecting a forecast of either doom or hope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I probably disappoint, if only because predictions for AI are getting harder and harder to make.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite that, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has, I must say, a pretty excellent track record of making sense of where AI is headed. We’ve just published a sharp list of predictions for what’s next in 2026 (where you can read my thoughts on the legal battles surrounding AI), and the predictions on last year’s list all came to fruition. But every holiday season, it gets harder and harder to work out the impact AI will have. That’s mostly because of three big unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For one, we don’t know if large language models will continue getting incrementally smarter in the near future. Since this particular technology is what underpins nearly all the excitement and anxiety in AI right now, powering everything from AI companions to customer service agents, its slowdown would be a pretty huge deal. Such a big deal, in fact, that we devoted a whole slate of stories in December to what a new post-AI-hype era might look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Number two, AI is pretty abysmally unpopular among the general public. Here’s just one example: Nearly a year ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman stood next to President Trump to excitedly announce a $500 billion project to build data centers across the US in order to train larger and larger AI models. The pair either did not guess or did not care that many Americans would staunchly oppose having such data centers built in their communities. A year later, Big Tech is waging an uphill battle to win over public opinion and keep on building. Can it win?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The response from lawmakers to all this frustration is terribly confused. Trump has pleased Big Tech CEOs by moving to make AI regulation a federal rather than a state issue, and tech companies are now hoping to codify this into law. But the crowd that wants to protect kids from chatbots ranges from progressive lawmakers in California to the increasingly Trump-aligned Federal Trade Commission, each with distinct motives and approaches. Will they be able to put aside their differences and rein AI firms in?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the gloomy holiday dinner table conversation gets this far, someone will say: Hey, isn’t AI being used for objectively good things? Making people healthier, unearthing scientific discoveries, better understanding climate change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, sort of. Machine learning, an older form of AI, has long been used in all sorts of scientific research. One branch, called deep learning, forms part of AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning tool for protein prediction that has transformed biology. Image recognition models are getting better at identifying cancerous cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the track record for &lt;em&gt;chatbots &lt;/em&gt;built atop newer large language models is more modest.

To get stories like this in your inbox first,&amp;nbsp;sign up here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes AI feels like a niche topic to write about, but then the holidays happen, and I hear relatives of all ages talking about cases of chatbot-induced psychosis, blaming rising electricity prices on data centers, and asking whether kids should have unfettered access to AI. It’s everywhere, in other words. And people are alarmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inevitably, these conversations take a turn: AI is having all these ripple effects &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but if the technology gets better, what happens next? That’s usually when they look at me, expecting a forecast of either doom or hope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I probably disappoint, if only because predictions for AI are getting harder and harder to make.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Despite that, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; has, I must say, a pretty excellent track record of making sense of where AI is headed. We’ve just published a sharp list of predictions for what’s next in 2026 (where you can read my thoughts on the legal battles surrounding AI), and the predictions on last year’s list all came to fruition. But every holiday season, it gets harder and harder to work out the impact AI will have. That’s mostly because of three big unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For one, we don’t know if large language models will continue getting incrementally smarter in the near future. Since this particular technology is what underpins nearly all the excitement and anxiety in AI right now, powering everything from AI companions to customer service agents, its slowdown would be a pretty huge deal. Such a big deal, in fact, that we devoted a whole slate of stories in December to what a new post-AI-hype era might look like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Number two, AI is pretty abysmally unpopular among the general public. Here’s just one example: Nearly a year ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman stood next to President Trump to excitedly announce a $500 billion project to build data centers across the US in order to train larger and larger AI models. The pair either did not guess or did not care that many Americans would staunchly oppose having such data centers built in their communities. A year later, Big Tech is waging an uphill battle to win over public opinion and keep on building. Can it win?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The response from lawmakers to all this frustration is terribly confused. Trump has pleased Big Tech CEOs by moving to make AI regulation a federal rather than a state issue, and tech companies are now hoping to codify this into law. But the crowd that wants to protect kids from chatbots ranges from progressive lawmakers in California to the increasingly Trump-aligned Federal Trade Commission, each with distinct motives and approaches. Will they be able to put aside their differences and rein AI firms in?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the gloomy holiday dinner table conversation gets this far, someone will say: Hey, isn’t AI being used for objectively good things? Making people healthier, unearthing scientific discoveries, better understanding climate change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, sort of. Machine learning, an older form of AI, has long been used in all sorts of scientific research. One branch, called deep learning, forms part of AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning tool for protein prediction that has transformed biology. Image recognition models are getting better at identifying cancerous cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the track record for &lt;em&gt;chatbots &lt;/em&gt;built atop newer large language models is more modest. Technologies like ChatGPT are quite good at analyzing large swathes of research to summarize what’s already been discovered. But some high-profile reports that these sorts of AI models had made a genuine discovery, like solving a previously unsolved mathematics problem, were bogus. They can assist doctors with diagnoses, but they can also encourage people to diagnose their own health problems without consulting doctors, sometimes with disastrous results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This time next year, we’ll probably have better answers to my family’s questions, and we’ll have a bunch of entirely new questions too.

They had rushed in from Yorkshire by air, sea, rail, and road. Once there, the Rats joined 14,000 other troops at the front line, dug in, and waited for the distant rumble of enemy armor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The deployment was part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog, intended to test the alliance’s capacity to react to a large Russian incursion. Naturally, it featured some of NATO’s heaviest weaponry: 69-ton battle tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and truck-mounted rocket launchers capable of firing supersonic missiles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But according to British Army tacticians, it was the 4th Brigade that brought the biggest knife to the fight—and strictly speaking, it wasn’t even a physical weapon. The Rats were backed up by an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” conceived under the name Project ASGARD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say a reconnaissance drone spots a tank hiding in a copse. In conventional operations, the soldier operating that drone would pass the intelligence through a centralized command chain of officers, the brains of the mission, who would collectively decide whether to shoot at it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a targeting web operates more like an octopus, whose neurons reach every extremity, allowing each of its tentacles to operate autonomously while also working collaboratively toward a central set of goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;During Hedgehog, the drones over Estonia traced wide orbits. They scanned the ground below with advanced object recognition systems. If one of them spied that hidden tank, it would transmit its image and location directly to nearby shooters—an artillery cannon, for example. Or another tank. Or an armed loitering munition drone sitting on a catapult, ready for launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The soldiers responsible for each weapon interfaced with the targeting web by means of Samsung smartphones. Once alerted to the detected target, the drone crew merely had to thumb a dropdown menu on the screen—which lists the available targeting options based on factors such as their pKill, which stands for “probability of kill”—for the drone to whip off into the sky and trace an all but irreversible course to its unsuspecting mark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. “The Russians are knocking on the door,” says Sven Weizenegger, the head of the German military’s Cyber Innovation Hub. Strategists and policymakers are counting on increasingly automated battlefield gadgetry to keep them from bursting through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and mass-­deployed drones have become decisive on the battlefield,” says Angelica Tikk, head of the Innovation Department at the Estonian Ministry of Defense. For a small state like Estonia, Tikk says, such technologies “allow us to punch above our weight.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mass-deployed,” in this case, is very much the operative term. Ukraine scaled up its drone production for its war against Russia from 2.2 million in 2024 to 4.5 million in 2025. EU defense and space commissioner Andrius Kubilius has estimated that in the event of a wider war with Russia the EU will need three million drones annually just to hold down Lithuania, a country of some 2.9 million people that’s about the size of West Virginia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Projects like ASGARD would take these figures and multiply them with the other key variable of warfare: speed. British officials claim that the targeting web’s kill chain, from the first detection of a target to strike decision, could take less than a minute. As a result, a press release noted, the system “will make the army 10 times more lethal over the next 10 years.” It is slated to be completed by 2027. Germany’s armed forces plan to deploy their own targeting web, Uranos KI, as early as 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The working theory behind these initiatives is that the right mix of lethal drones—conceived by a new crop of tech firms, sprinted to the front lines with uncommon haste, and guided to their targets by algorithmic networks—will deliver Europe an overwhelming victory in the event of an outright war. Or better yet, it will give the continent such a wide advantage that nobody would think to attack it in the first place, an effect that Eric Slesinger, a Madrid-based venture capitalist focused on defense startups, describes as “brutal, guns-and-steel, feel-it-in-your-gut deterrence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. The costs of actually winning a massive drone war are likely to be more than just financial. The human toll of these technologies would extend far behind the front lines, fundamentally transforming how the European Union—from its outset, a project of peace—lives, fights, and dies. And even then, victory would be far from assured.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anything, Europe could be laying its hand on a perpetual hair trigger that nobody can afford for it to pull.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Build it, then sell it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Twenty companies participated in Project ASGARD. They range from eager startups, flush with VC backing, to defense giants like General Dynamics. Each contender could play an important role in Europe’s future. But no firm among them has more tightly captured the current European military zeitgeist than Helsing, which provided both drones and AI for the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2021 by a theoretical physicist, a former McKinsey partner, and a biologist turned video-game developer, with an early investment of €100 million (then about $115 million) from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Helsing has quickly risen to the apex of Europe’s new defense tech ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Munich-based company has an established presence in Europe’s major capitals, staffed by a deep bench of former government and military officials. Buoyed by a series of high-profile government contracts and partnerships, along with additional rounds of funding, the company catapulted to a $12 billion valuation last June. It is now Europe’s most valuable defense startup by a wide margin, and the one that would be most likely to find itself at the tip of the spear if Europe’s new cold war were to suddenly turn hot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, the company made military software. But it has recently expanded its offerings to include physical weapons such as AI-assisted missile drones and uncrewed autonomous fighter jets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In part, this reflects a shift in European demand. In March 2025, the European Commission called for a “once-in-a-generation surge in European defence investment,” citing drones and AI as two of seven priority investment areas for a new initiative that will unlock almost a trillion dollars for weapons over the coming years. Germany alone has allocated nearly $12 billion to build its drone arsenal. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Antoine Bordes, chief scientist, Helsing&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in equal measure, the company is looking to shape Europe’s military-industrial posture. In conventional weapons programs in Europe, governments tell companies what to build through a rigid contracting process. Helsing flips that process on its head. Like a growing number of new defense firms, it is guided by what Antoine Bordes, its chief scientist, describes as “a more traditional tech-startup muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that,” says Bordes, who was previously a leader in AI research at Meta. Government officials across Europe have proved receptive to the model, calling for agile contracting instruments that allow militaries to more easily open their pocketbooks when a company comes to them with an idea.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129854" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3CPAF5A.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Bavaria’s Minister-President, Markus Söder, receives instruction on Helsing air combat software in Tussenhausen, Germany.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;DPA PICTURE ALLIANCE/ALAMY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s pitch deck for the future of European defense bristles with weapons that will operate across land, air, sea, and space. In the highest reaches of Helsing’s imagined battlefield, a constellation of reconnaissance satellites, which the company is collaborating on with Loft Orbital, will “detect, identify and classify military assets worldwide.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lower down, the company’s HF-1 and HX-2 loitering munition drones—so called because they combine the functions of a small reconnaissance drone and a missile—can stalk the skies for long periods before zeroing in on their targets. To date, the company has publicly disclosed orders for around 10,000 airframes to be delivered to Ukraine. It won’t say how many have been deployed, although it told Bloomberg in April that its drones had been used in dozens of successful missions in the conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At sea, the company envisions battalions of drone mini-subs that can plunge as deep as 3,000 feet and rove for 90 days without human control, serving as a hidden guard watch for maritime incursions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s newest offering, the Europa, is a four-and-a-half-ton fighter jet with no human pilot on board. In a set of moody promo pictures released in 2025, the drone has the profile of an upturned boning knife. Carrying hundreds of pounds of weaponry, it is meant to charge deep into heavily defended airspace, flying under the command of a human pilot much farther away (like Tom Cruise in &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; if his costars were robots and he were safely beyond the range of enemy anti-aircraft missiles). Helsing says that the Europa, which resembles designs offered by a number of other firms, is engineered to be “mass-producible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Linking all these elements together is Altra, the company’s so-called “­recce-strike software platform,” which served as part of the collective brain in the ASGARD trials. It’s the key piece. “These kill webs are competitive in attack and defense,” says General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the United Kingdom’s Joint Forces Command, who recently coauthored a major Ministry of Defense modernization plan that champions the deterrent effect of autonomous targeting webs. Barrons invited me to imagine Russian leaders contemplating a possible incursion into Narva in eastern Estonia. “If they’ve done a reasonable job,” he said, referring to NATO, “Russia knows not to do that … that little incursion—it will never get there. It’ll be destroyed the minute it sets foot across the border.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With a targeting web in place, a medley of missiles, drones, and artillery could coordinate across borders and domains to hit anything that moves. On its product page for Altra, Helsing notes that the system is capable of orchestrating “saturation attacks,” a military tactic for breaching an adversary’s defenses with a barrage of synchronized weapon strikes. The goal of the technology, a Helsing VP named Simon Brünjes explained in a speech to an Israeli defense convention in 2024, is “lethality that deters effectively.”&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To put it a bit less delicately, the idea is to show any potential aggressors that Europe is capable, if provoked, of absolutely losing its shit. The US Navy is working to establish a similar capacity for defending Taiwan with hordes of autonomous drones that rain down on Chinese vessels in coordinated volleys. The admirals have their own name for the result such swarms are intended to achieve: “hellscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The humans in the loop&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to achieving the full effect of saturation attacks is not the technology. It’s the human element. “A million drones are great, but you’re going to need a million people,” says Richard Drake, head of the European branch of Anduril, which builds a product range similar to Helsing’s and also participated in ASGARD.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Drake says the kill chain in a system like ASGARD “can all be done autonomously.” But for now, “there is a human in the loop making those final decisions.” Government rules require it. Echoing the stance of most other European states, Estonia’s Tikk told me, “We also insist that human control is maintained over decisions related to the use of lethal force.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s drones in Ukraine use object recognition to detect targets, which the operator reviews before approving a strike. The aircraft operate without human control only once they enter their “terminal guidance” phase, about half a mile from their target. Some locally produced drones employ similar “last mile” autonomy. This hands-free strike mode is said to have a hit rate in the range of 75%, according to research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (A Helsing spokesperson said that the company uses “multiple visual aids” to mitigate “potential difficulties” in target recognition during terminal guidance.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="drone in mid-flight" class="wp-image-1129857" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Helsing_HX-2_Flying_1.jpg?w=533" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Originally, Helsing exclusively sold software. But in 2024 it unveiled a strike drone, the HF-1, followed by another, the HX-2 (pictured).&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t quite make them killer robots. But it suggests that the barriers to full lethal autonomy are no longer necessarily technical. Helsing’s Brünjes has reportedly said its strike drones can “technically” perform missions without human control, though the company does not support full autonomy. Bordes declined to say whether the company’s fielded drones can be switched into a fully autonomous mode in the event that a government changes its policy midway through a conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Either way, the company could loosen the loop in the coming years. Helsing’s AI team in Paris, led by Bordes, is working to enable a single human to oversee multiple HX-2 drones in flight simultaneously. Anduril is developing a similar “one-to-many” system in which a single operator could marshal a fleet of 10 or more drones at a time, Drake says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such swarms a human is technically still involved, but that person’s capacity to decide upon the actions of any single drone is diminished, especially if the drones are coordinating to saturate a wide area. (In a statement, a Helsing spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “We do not and will not build technology where a machine makes the final decision.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Morris Tidball-Binz, UN Special Rapporteur&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like other projects in its portfolio, Helsing’s research on swarming HX-2s is not intended for a current government contract but, rather, to anticipate future ones. “We feel that this needs to be done, and done properly, because this is what we need,” Bordes told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be sure, this thinking is not happening in a vacuum. The push toward autonomy in Ukraine is largely driven by advances in jamming technologies, which disrupt the links between drones and their operators. Russia has reportedly been upgrading its strike drones with sharper autonomous target recognition, as well as modems that enable them to communicate among themselves in a sort of proto-swarm. In October, it conducted a test of an autonomous torpedo said to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads powerful enough to create tsunamis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Governments are well aware that if Europe’s only response to such challenges is to further automate its own lethality, the result could be a race with no winners. “The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later,” UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz has warned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And yet officials are struggling to imagine an alternative. “If you don’t have the people, then you can’t control so many drones,” says Weizenegger, of the German Cyber Innovation Hub. “So therefore you need swarming technologies in place—you know, autonomous systems.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It sounds very harsh,” he says, referring to the idea of removing the human from the loop. “But it’s about winning or losing. There are only these two options. There is no third option.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The need for speed&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In its pitches, Helsing often emphasizes a sense of dire urgency. “We don’t know when we could be attacked,” one executive said at a technology summit in Berlin in September 2025. “Are we ready to fight tonight in the Baltics? The answer is no.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company boasts that it has a singular capacity to fix that. In September 2024 it embarked on a project to develop an AI agent capable of controlling fighter aircraft. By May of the following year the agent was operating a Swedish Gripen&amp;nbsp;E jet in tests over the Baltic Sea. The company calls such timelines “Helsing speed.” The Europa combat jet drone is slated to be ready by 2029.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;European governments have adopted a similar fixation with haste. “We need to fast-track,” says Weizenegger. “If we start testing in 2029, it’s probably too late.” Last February, announcing that Denmark would increase defense spending by 50 billion kroner ($7 billion), Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference, “If we can’t get the best equipment, buy the next best. There’s only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That same month, Helsing announced that it will establish a network of “resilience factories” across Europe—dispersed and secret—to churn out drones at a wartime clip. The network will be put to its first real test in the coming months, when the German government finalizes a planned €300 million order for 12,000 Helsing HX-2s to equip an armored brigade stationed in Lithuania.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company says that its first factory, somewhere in southern Germany, can produce 1,000 drones a month—or roughly six drones an hour, assuming a respectable 40-hour European work week. At that pace, it would fill Germany’s order in a year. In reality, though, it could take longer. As of last summer, the facility was operating at less than half its capacity because of staffing shortages. (A company spokesperson did not respond to questions about its current production capacity and declined to provide information on how many drones it has produced to date.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will take a lot of factories for Europe to fully arm up. When Helsing unveiled its resilience factory project, one of its founders, Torsten Reil, wrote on LinkedIn that “100,000 HX-2 strike drones would deter a land invasion of Europe once and for all.” Helsing now says that Germany alone should maintain a store of 200,000 HX-2s to tide it over for the first two months of a Russian invasion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if Europe can surge its capacity to such levels, not everyone is convinced that massed drones are a winning pitch. While drones now account for somewhere between 70% and 80% of all combat casualties in Ukraine, “they’re not determining outcomes on the battlefield,” says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, drones have brought the conflict to a grinding stalemate, leading to what a team of American, British, and French air force officers have called “a Somme in the sky.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This dynamic has led to remarkable advances in drone communications and autonomy. But each breakthrough is quickly met with a countermeasure. In some areas where jamming has made wireless communication particularly difficult, pilots control their drones using long spools of fiber-­optic filament. In turn, their opponents have engineered rotating barbed wire traps to snare the filaments as they drag along the ground, as well as drone interceptors that can knock the unjammable drones out of the sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you produce millions of drones right now, they will become obsolete in maybe a year or half a year,” says Kateryna Bondar, a former Ukrainian government advisor. “So it doesn’t make sense to produce them, stockpile, and wait for attack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nor is AI necessarily up to the task of piloting so many drones, despite industry claims to the contrary. Bohdan Sas, a founder of the Ukrainian drone company Buntar Aerospace, told me that he finds it amusing when Western companies claim to have achieved “super-fancy recognition and target acquisition on some target in testing,” only to reveal that the test site was “an open field and a target in the center.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not really how it works in reality,” Sas says. “In reality, everything is really well hidden.” (A Helsing spokesperson said, “Our target recognition technology has proven itself on the battlefield hundreds of times.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zachary Kallenborn, a research associate at the University of Oxford, told me that in Ukraine, Russian forces have been known to deactivate the autonomous functionalities of their Lancet loitering munitions. In real-world conditions, he says, AI can fail—“And so what happens if you have 100,000 drones operating that way?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Death’s darts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In September, while reporting this story, I visited Corbera, a town perched on a rocky outcrop among the limestone hills of Terra Alta in western Catalonia. In the late summer of 1938, Corbera was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The site is just as much a reminder of past horrors as it is a warning of future ones. The town was repeatedly targeted by German and Italian aircraft, a breakthrough technology that was, at the time, roughly as novel as modern drones are to us today. Military planners who led the Spanish campaigns famously used the raids to perfect the technology’s destructive potential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the last four years, Ukraine has served a similar role as Europe’s living laboratory of carnage. According to Bondar, some Ukrainian units have begun charging Western companies a fee to operate their drones in battle. In return, the companies receive reams of real-world data that can’t be replicated on a test range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;General Richard Barrons, former commander, United Kingdom Joint Forces Command&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What this data doesn’t show is the mess that the technology leaves behind. In Ukraine, drones now account for more civilian casualties than any other weapon. A United Nations human rights commission recently concluded that Russia has used drones “with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population”—a crime against humanity—along a 185-mile stretch of the Dnipro River. One local resident told investigators, “We are hit every day. Drones fly at any time—morning, evening, day or night, constantly.” The commission also sought to investigate Russian allegations of Ukrainian drone attacks on civilians but was not granted sufficient access to make a determination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A European drone war would invite similar tragedies on a much grander scale. Tens of millions of people live within drone-strike range of Europe’s eastern border with Russia. Today’s ethical calculus could change. At a media event last summer, Helsing’s Brünjes told reporters that in Ukraine, “we want a human to be making the decision” in lethal strikes. But in “a full-scale war with China or Russia,” he said, “it’s a different question.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the scenario of an incursion into Narva, Richard Barrons told me that Russia should also know that once its initial attack is repelled, NATO would use long-range missiles and jet drones—abetted by the same targeting webs—to immediately retaliate deep within Russian territory. Such talk may be bluster. The point of deterrence is, after all, to stave off war with the mere threat of unbearable violence. But it can leave little room for deescalation in the event of an actual fight. Could one be sure that Russia, which recently lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons, would stand down? “The mindset that these kinds of systems are now being rolled out in is one where we’re not imagining off-ramps,” says Richard Moyes, the director of ​Article 36, a British nonprofit focused on the protection of civilians in conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129855" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a566f8481b83a3e4cd79eb0013d4f1b98fce025f-1500x1001-1.jpg?w=1266" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An Anduril autonomous surveillance station. Such “sentries” can be used to detect, identify, and track “objects of interest,” such as drones.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To this day, Corbera’s old center lies in ruins. The crumbled homes sit desolate of life but for the fig trees struggling up through the rubble and the odd skink that scurries across a splintered beam. Walking through the wasteland, I was taken by how much it resembles any other war zone. It could have been Tigray, or Khartoum. Or Gaza, a living hellscape where AI targeting tools played a central role in accelerating Israel’s cataclysmic bombing campaign. What particular innovation wrought such misery seemed almost beside the point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is,” Barrons told me, a couple of weeks after I was in Corbera. “I think on planet Helsing and Anduril,” he went on, “they’re not really fighting, in many respects. And it’s a different mindset.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A Helsing spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the company “was founded to provide democracies with technology built in Europe essential for credible deterrence, and to ensure this technology is developed in line with tight ethical standards.” He went on to say that “ethically built autonomous systems are limiting noncombatant casualties more effectively than any previous category of weapon.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would such a claim, if true, bear out in a gloves-off war between major powers? “I would be extraordinarily cautious of anyone who says, ‘Yeah, 100% this is how the future of autonomous warfare looks,’” Kallenborn told me. And yet, there are some certainties we can count on. Every weapon, no matter how smart, carries within it a variation of the same story. “Lethality” means what it says. The only difference is how quickly—and how massively—that story comes to its sad, definitive end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arthur Holland Michel is a journalist and researcher who covers emerging technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_0 html_first"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers of the 4th Light Brigade, also known as the Black Rats, descended upon the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories. They had rushed in from Yorkshire by air, sea, rail, and road. Once there, the Rats joined 14,000 other troops at the front line, dug in, and waited for the distant rumble of enemy armor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The deployment was part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog, intended to test the alliance’s capacity to react to a large Russian incursion. Naturally, it featured some of NATO’s heaviest weaponry: 69-ton battle tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and truck-mounted rocket launchers capable of firing supersonic missiles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_3"&gt; &lt;p&gt;But according to British Army tacticians, it was the 4th Brigade that brought the biggest knife to the fight—and strictly speaking, it wasn’t even a physical weapon. The Rats were backed up by an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” conceived under the name Project ASGARD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_5"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say a reconnaissance drone spots a tank hiding in a copse. In conventional operations, the soldier operating that drone would pass the intelligence through a centralized command chain of officers, the brains of the mission, who would collectively decide whether to shoot at it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a targeting web operates more like an octopus, whose neurons reach every extremity, allowing each of its tentacles to operate autonomously while also working collaboratively toward a central set of goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;During Hedgehog, the drones over Estonia traced wide orbits. They scanned the ground below with advanced object recognition systems. If one of them spied that hidden tank, it would transmit its image and location directly to nearby shooters—an artillery cannon, for example. Or another tank. Or an armed loitering munition drone sitting on a catapult, ready for launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The soldiers responsible for each weapon interfaced with the targeting web by means of Samsung smartphones. Once alerted to the detected target, the drone crew merely had to thumb a dropdown menu on the screen—which lists the available targeting options based on factors such as their pKill, which stands for “probability of kill”—for the drone to whip off into the sky and trace an all but irreversible course to its unsuspecting mark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. “The Russians are knocking on the door,” says Sven Weizenegger, the head of the German military’s Cyber Innovation Hub. Strategists and policymakers are counting on increasingly automated battlefield gadgetry to keep them from bursting through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and mass-­deployed drones have become decisive on the battlefield,” says Angelica Tikk, head of the Innovation Department at the Estonian Ministry of Defense. For a small state like Estonia, Tikk says, such technologies “allow us to punch above our weight.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_7"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mass-deployed,” in this case, is very much the operative term. Ukraine scaled up its drone production for its war against Russia from 2.2 million in 2024 to 4.5 million in 2025. EU defense and space commissioner Andrius Kubilius has estimated that in the event of a wider war with Russia the EU will need three million drones annually just to hold down Lithuania, a country of some 2.9 million people that’s about the size of West Virginia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Projects like ASGARD would take these figures and multiply them with the other key variable of warfare: speed. British officials claim that the targeting web’s kill chain, from the first detection of a target to strike decision, could take less than a minute. As a result, a press release noted, the system “will make the army 10 times more lethal over the next 10 years.” It is slated to be completed by 2027. Germany’s armed forces plan to deploy their own targeting web, Uranos KI, as early as 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The working theory behind these initiatives is that the right mix of lethal drones—conceived by a new crop of tech firms, sprinted to the front lines with uncommon haste, and guided to their targets by algorithmic networks—will deliver Europe an overwhelming victory in the event of an outright war. Or better yet, it will give the continent such a wide advantage that nobody would think to attack it in the first place, an effect that Eric Slesinger, a Madrid-based venture capitalist focused on defense startups, describes as “brutal, guns-and-steel, feel-it-in-your-gut deterrence.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. The costs of actually winning a massive drone war are likely to be more than just financial. The human toll of these technologies would extend far behind the front lines, fundamentally transforming how the European Union—from its outset, a project of peace—lives, fights, and dies. And even then, victory would be far from assured.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_9"&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anything, Europe could be laying its hand on a perpetual hair trigger that nobody can afford for it to pull.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Build it, then sell it&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Twenty companies participated in Project ASGARD. They range from eager startups, flush with VC backing, to defense giants like General Dynamics. Each contender could play an important role in Europe’s future. But no firm among them has more tightly captured the current European military zeitgeist than Helsing, which provided both drones and AI for the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2021 by a theoretical physicist, a former McKinsey partner, and a biologist turned video-game developer, with an early investment of €100 million (then about $115 million) from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Helsing has quickly risen to the apex of Europe’s new defense tech ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Munich-based company has an established presence in Europe’s major capitals, staffed by a deep bench of former government and military officials. Buoyed by a series of high-profile government contracts and partnerships, along with additional rounds of funding, the company catapulted to a $12 billion valuation last June. It is now Europe’s most valuable defense startup by a wide margin, and the one that would be most likely to find itself at the tip of the spear if Europe’s new cold war were to suddenly turn hot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_11"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, the company made military software. But it has recently expanded its offerings to include physical weapons such as AI-assisted missile drones and uncrewed autonomous fighter jets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In part, this reflects a shift in European demand. In March 2025, the European Commission called for a “once-in-a-generation surge in European defence investment,” citing drones and AI as two of seven priority investment areas for a new initiative that will unlock almost a trillion dollars for weapons over the coming years. Germany alone has allocated nearly $12 billion to build its drone arsenal. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Antoine Bordes, chief scientist, Helsing&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in equal measure, the company is looking to shape Europe’s military-industrial posture. In conventional weapons programs in Europe, governments tell companies what to build through a rigid contracting process. Helsing flips that process on its head. Like a growing number of new defense firms, it is guided by what Antoine Bordes, its chief scientist, describes as “a more traditional tech-startup muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that,” says Bordes, who was previously a leader in AI research at Meta. Government officials across Europe have proved receptive to the model, calling for agile contracting instruments that allow militaries to more easily open their pocketbooks when a company comes to them with an idea.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129854" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3CPAF5A.jpg?w=2667" width="2667" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Bavaria’s Minister-President, Markus Söder, receives instruction on Helsing air combat software in Tussenhausen, Germany.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;DPA PICTURE ALLIANCE/ALAMY&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s pitch deck for the future of European defense bristles with weapons that will operate across land, air, sea, and space. In the highest reaches of Helsing’s imagined battlefield, a constellation of reconnaissance satellites, which the company is collaborating on with Loft Orbital, will “detect, identify and classify military assets worldwide.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lower down, the company’s HF-1 and HX-2 loitering munition drones—so called because they combine the functions of a small reconnaissance drone and a missile—can stalk the skies for long periods before zeroing in on their targets. To date, the company has publicly disclosed orders for around 10,000 airframes to be delivered to Ukraine. It won’t say how many have been deployed, although it told Bloomberg in April that its drones had been used in dozens of successful missions in the conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_13"&gt; &lt;p&gt;At sea, the company envisions battalions of drone mini-subs that can plunge as deep as 3,000 feet and rove for 90 days without human control, serving as a hidden guard watch for maritime incursions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s newest offering, the Europa, is a four-and-a-half-ton fighter jet with no human pilot on board. In a set of moody promo pictures released in 2025, the drone has the profile of an upturned boning knife. Carrying hundreds of pounds of weaponry, it is meant to charge deep into heavily defended airspace, flying under the command of a human pilot much farther away (like Tom Cruise in &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; if his costars were robots and he were safely beyond the range of enemy anti-aircraft missiles). Helsing says that the Europa, which resembles designs offered by a number of other firms, is engineered to be “mass-producible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_16"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Linking all these elements together is Altra, the company’s so-called “­recce-strike software platform,” which served as part of the collective brain in the ASGARD trials. It’s the key piece. “These kill webs are competitive in attack and defense,” says General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the United Kingdom’s Joint Forces Command, who recently coauthored a major Ministry of Defense modernization plan that champions the deterrent effect of autonomous targeting webs. Barrons invited me to imagine Russian leaders contemplating a possible incursion into Narva in eastern Estonia. “If they’ve done a reasonable job,” he said, referring to NATO, “Russia knows not to do that … that little incursion—it will never get there. It’ll be destroyed the minute it sets foot across the border.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With a targeting web in place, a medley of missiles, drones, and artillery could coordinate across borders and domains to hit anything that moves. On its product page for Altra, Helsing notes that the system is capable of orchestrating “saturation attacks,” a military tactic for breaching an adversary’s defenses with a barrage of synchronized weapon strikes. The goal of the technology, a Helsing VP named Simon Brünjes explained in a speech to an Israeli defense convention in 2024, is “lethality that deters effectively.”&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To put it a bit less delicately, the idea is to show any potential aggressors that Europe is capable, if provoked, of absolutely losing its shit. The US Navy is working to establish a similar capacity for defending Taiwan with hordes of autonomous drones that rain down on Chinese vessels in coordinated volleys. The admirals have their own name for the result such swarms are intended to achieve: “hellscape.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The humans in the loop&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to achieving the full effect of saturation attacks is not the technology. It’s the human element. “A million drones are great, but you’re going to need a million people,” says Richard Drake, head of the European branch of Anduril, which builds a product range similar to Helsing’s and also participated in ASGARD.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Drake says the kill chain in a system like ASGARD “can all be done autonomously.” But for now, “there is a human in the loop making those final decisions.” Government rules require it. Echoing the stance of most other European states, Estonia’s Tikk told me, “We also insist that human control is maintained over decisions related to the use of lethal force.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helsing’s drones in Ukraine use object recognition to detect targets, which the operator reviews before approving a strike. The aircraft operate without human control only once they enter their “terminal guidance” phase, about half a mile from their target. Some locally produced drones employ similar “last mile” autonomy. This hands-free strike mode is said to have a hit rate in the range of 75%, according to research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (A Helsing spokesperson said that the company uses “multiple visual aids” to mitigate “potential difficulties” in target recognition during terminal guidance.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="drone in mid-flight" class="wp-image-1129857" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Helsing_HX-2_Flying_1.jpg?w=533" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Originally, Helsing exclusively sold software. But in 2024 it unveiled a strike drone, the HF-1, followed by another, the HX-2 (pictured).&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t quite make them killer robots. But it suggests that the barriers to full lethal autonomy are no longer necessarily technical. Helsing’s Brünjes has reportedly said its strike drones can “technically” perform missions without human control, though the company does not support full autonomy. Bordes declined to say whether the company’s fielded drones can be switched into a fully autonomous mode in the event that a government changes its policy midway through a conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Either way, the company could loosen the loop in the coming years. Helsing’s AI team in Paris, led by Bordes, is working to enable a single human to oversee multiple HX-2 drones in flight simultaneously. Anduril is developing a similar “one-to-many” system in which a single operator could marshal a fleet of 10 or more drones at a time, Drake says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_19"&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such swarms a human is technically still involved, but that person’s capacity to decide upon the actions of any single drone is diminished, especially if the drones are coordinating to saturate a wide area. (In a statement, a Helsing spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, “We do not and will not build technology where a machine makes the final decision.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Morris Tidball-Binz, UN Special Rapporteur&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like other projects in its portfolio, Helsing’s research on swarming HX-2s is not intended for a current government contract but, rather, to anticipate future ones. “We feel that this needs to be done, and done properly, because this is what we need,” Bordes told me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be sure, this thinking is not happening in a vacuum. The push toward autonomy in Ukraine is largely driven by advances in jamming technologies, which disrupt the links between drones and their operators. Russia has reportedly been upgrading its strike drones with sharper autonomous target recognition, as well as modems that enable them to communicate among themselves in a sort of proto-swarm. In October, it conducted a test of an autonomous torpedo said to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads powerful enough to create tsunamis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Governments are well aware that if Europe’s only response to such challenges is to further automate its own lethality, the result could be a race with no winners. “The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later,” UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz has warned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And yet officials are struggling to imagine an alternative. “If you don’t have the people, then you can’t control so many drones,” says Weizenegger, of the German Cyber Innovation Hub. “So therefore you need swarming technologies in place—you know, autonomous systems.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“It sounds very harsh,” he says, referring to the idea of removing the human from the loop. “But it’s about winning or losing. There are only these two options. There is no third option.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The need for speed&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In its pitches, Helsing often emphasizes a sense of dire urgency. “We don’t know when we could be attacked,” one executive said at a technology summit in Berlin in September 2025. “Are we ready to fight tonight in the Baltics? The answer is no.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The company boasts that it has a singular capacity to fix that. In September 2024 it embarked on a project to develop an AI agent capable of controlling fighter aircraft. By May of the following year the agent was operating a Swedish Gripen&amp;nbsp;E jet in tests over the Baltic Sea. The company calls such timelines “Helsing speed.” The Europa combat jet drone is slated to be ready by 2029.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_21"&gt; &lt;p&gt;European governments have adopted a similar fixation with haste. “We need to fast-track,” says Weizenegger. “If we start testing in 2029, it’s probably too late.” Last February, announcing that Denmark would increase defense spending by 50 billion kroner ($7 billion), Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference, “If we can’t get the best equipment, buy the next best. There’s only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That same month, Helsing announced that it will establish a network of “resilience factories” across Europe—dispersed and secret—to churn out drones at a wartime clip. The network will be put to its first real test in the coming months, when the German government finalizes a planned €300 million order for 12,000 Helsing HX-2s to equip an armored brigade stationed in Lithuania.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_23"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company says that its first factory, somewhere in southern Germany, can produce 1,000 drones a month—or roughly six drones an hour, assuming a respectable 40-hour European work week. At that pace, it would fill Germany’s order in a year. In reality, though, it could take longer. As of last summer, the facility was operating at less than half its capacity because of staffing shortages. (A company spokesperson did not respond to questions about its current production capacity and declined to provide information on how many drones it has produced to date.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It will take a lot of factories for Europe to fully arm up. When Helsing unveiled its resilience factory project, one of its founders, Torsten Reil, wrote on LinkedIn that “100,000 HX-2 strike drones would deter a land invasion of Europe once and for all.” Helsing now says that Germany alone should maintain a store of 200,000 HX-2s to tide it over for the first two months of a Russian invasion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class="related__wrap"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_25"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if Europe can surge its capacity to such levels, not everyone is convinced that massed drones are a winning pitch. While drones now account for somewhere between 70% and 80% of all combat casualties in Ukraine, “they’re not determining outcomes on the battlefield,” says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, drones have brought the conflict to a grinding stalemate, leading to what a team of American, British, and French air force officers have called “a Somme in the sky.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This dynamic has led to remarkable advances in drone communications and autonomy. But each breakthrough is quickly met with a countermeasure. In some areas where jamming has made wireless communication particularly difficult, pilots control their drones using long spools of fiber-­optic filament. In turn, their opponents have engineered rotating barbed wire traps to snare the filaments as they drag along the ground, as well as drone interceptors that can knock the unjammable drones out of the sky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“If you produce millions of drones right now, they will become obsolete in maybe a year or half a year,” says Kateryna Bondar, a former Ukrainian government advisor. “So it doesn’t make sense to produce them, stockpile, and wait for attack.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nor is AI necessarily up to the task of piloting so many drones, despite industry claims to the contrary. Bohdan Sas, a founder of the Ukrainian drone company Buntar Aerospace, told me that he finds it amusing when Western companies claim to have achieved “super-fancy recognition and target acquisition on some target in testing,” only to reveal that the test site was “an open field and a target in the center.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_27"&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not really how it works in reality,” Sas says. “In reality, everything is really well hidden.” (A Helsing spokesperson said, “Our target recognition technology has proven itself on the battlefield hundreds of times.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zachary Kallenborn, a research associate at the University of Oxford, told me that in Ukraine, Russian forces have been known to deactivate the autonomous functionalities of their Lancet loitering munitions. In real-world conditions, he says, AI can fail—“And so what happens if you have 100,000 drones operating that way?”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Death’s darts&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In September, while reporting this story, I visited Corbera, a town perched on a rocky outcrop among the limestone hills of Terra Alta in western Catalonia. In the late summer of 1938, Corbera was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The site is just as much a reminder of past horrors as it is a warning of future ones. The town was repeatedly targeted by German and Italian aircraft, a breakthrough technology that was, at the time, roughly as novel as modern drones are to us today. Military planners who led the Spanish campaigns famously used the raids to perfect the technology’s destructive potential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_29"&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the last four years, Ukraine has served a similar role as Europe’s living laboratory of carnage. According to Bondar, some Ukrainian units have begun charging Western companies a fee to operate their drones in battle. In return, the companies receive reams of real-world data that can’t be replicated on a test range.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;cite&gt;General Richard Barrons, former commander, United Kingdom Joint Forces Command&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What this data doesn’t show is the mess that the technology leaves behind. In Ukraine, drones now account for more civilian casualties than any other weapon. A United Nations human rights commission recently concluded that Russia has used drones “with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population”—a crime against humanity—along a 185-mile stretch of the Dnipro River. One local resident told investigators, “We are hit every day. Drones fly at any time—morning, evening, day or night, constantly.” The commission also sought to investigate Russian allegations of Ukrainian drone attacks on civilians but was not granted sufficient access to make a determination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A European drone war would invite similar tragedies on a much grander scale. Tens of millions of people live within drone-strike range of Europe’s eastern border with Russia. Today’s ethical calculus could change. At a media event last summer, Helsing’s Brünjes told reporters that in Ukraine, “we want a human to be making the decision” in lethal strikes. But in “a full-scale war with China or Russia,” he said, “it’s a different question.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the scenario of an incursion into Narva, Richard Barrons told me that Russia should also know that once its initial attack is repelled, NATO would use long-range missiles and jet drones—abetted by the same targeting webs—to immediately retaliate deep within Russian territory. Such talk may be bluster. The point of deterrence is, after all, to stave off war with the mere threat of unbearable violence. But it can leave little room for deescalation in the event of an actual fight. Could one be sure that Russia, which recently lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons, would stand down? “The mindset that these kinds of systems are now being rolled out in is one where we’re not imagining off-ramps,” says Richard Moyes, the director of ​Article 36, a British nonprofit focused on the protection of civilians in conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_31"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-1129855" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a566f8481b83a3e4cd79eb0013d4f1b98fce025f-1500x1001-1.jpg?w=1266" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;An Anduril autonomous surveillance station. Such “sentries” can be used to detect, identify, and track “objects of interest,” such as drones.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To this day, Corbera’s old center lies in ruins. The crumbled homes sit desolate of life but for the fig trees struggling up through the rubble and the odd skink that scurries across a splintered beam. Walking through the wasteland, I was taken by how much it resembles any other war zone. It could have been Tigray, or Khartoum. Or Gaza, a living hellscape where AI targeting tools played a central role in accelerating Israel’s cataclysmic bombing campaign. What particular innovation wrought such misery seemed almost beside the point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is,” Barrons told me, a couple of weeks after I was in Corbera. “I think on planet Helsing and Anduril,” he went on, “they’re not really fighting, in many respects. And it’s a different mindset.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A Helsing spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the company “was founded to provide democracies with technology built in Europe essential for credible deterrence, and to ensure this technology is developed in line with tight ethical standards.” He went on to say that “ethically built autonomous systems are limiting noncombatant casualties more effectively than any previous category of weapon.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would such a claim, if true, bear out in a gloves-off war between major powers? “I would be extraordinarily cautious of anyone who says, ‘Yeah, 100% this is how the future of autonomous warfare looks,’” Kallenborn told me. And yet, there are some certainties we can count on. Every weapon, no matter how smart, carries within it a variation of the same story. “Lethality” means what it says. The only difference is how quickly—and how massively—that story comes to its sad, definitive end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arthur Holland Michel is a journalist and researcher who covers emerging technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;svg class="monogramTLogo" viewBox="0 0 1091.84 1091.84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#6d6e71" points="363.95 0 363.95 1091.84 727.89 1091.84 727.89 363.95 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#939598" points="363.95 0 728.24 365.18 1091.84 364.13 1091.84 0 363.95 0"&gt;&lt;polygon fill="#414042" points="0 0 0 0.03 0 363.95 363.95 363.95 363.95 0 0 0"&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1129737/autonomous-warfare-europe-drones-defense-automated-kill-chains/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
