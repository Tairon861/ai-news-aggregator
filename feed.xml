Across sectors, AI in research and development cycles may reduce time-to-market by 50% and lower costs in industries like automotive and aerospace by as much as 30%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This is one of those inflection points where I don’t think anybody really has a full view of the significance of the change this is going to have on not just companies but society as a whole,” says Patrick Milligan, chief information security officer at Ford, which is making AI an important part of its transformation efforts and expanding its use across company operations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given its game-changing potential—and the breakneck speed with which it is evolving—it is perhaps not surprising that companies are feeling the pressure to deploy AI as soon as possible: 98% say they feel an increased sense of urgency in the last year. And 85% believe they have less than 18 months to deploy an AI strategy or they will see negative business effects.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Companies that take a “wait and see” approach will fall behind, says Jeetu Patel, president and chief product officer at Cisco. “If you wait for too long, you risk becoming irrelevant,” he says. “I don’t worry about AI taking my job, but I definitely worry about another person that uses AI better than me or another company that uses AI better taking my job or making my company irrelevant.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1122679" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MITTR-Cicso-Socials_V2-821254.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But despite the urgency, just 13% of companies globally say they are ready to leverage AI to its full potential. IT infrastructure is an increasing challenge as workloads grow ever larger. Two-thirds (68%) of organizations say their infrastructure is moderately ready at best to adopt and scale AI technologies. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Essential capabilities include adequate compute power to process complex AI models, optimized network performance across the organization and in data centers, and enhanced cybersecurity capabilities to detect and prevent sophisticated attacks. This must be combined with observability, which ensures the reliable and optimized performance of infrastructure, models, and the overall AI system by providing continuous monitoring and analysis of their behavior. Good quality, well-managed enterprise-wide data is also essential—after all, AI is only as good as the data it draws on.

The company told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; it is now training its bots not to engage with teenagers on topics like self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders, and to avoid romantic banter. These are temporary steps while it develops longer-term rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes follow a &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; investigation that found Meta’s systems could generate sexualised content, including shirtless images of underage celebrities, and engage children in conversations that were romantic or suggestive. One case reported by the news agency described a man dying after rushing to an address provided by a chatbot in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway admitted the company had made mistakes. She said Meta is “training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources,” and confirmed that certain AI characters, like highly sexualised ones like “Russian Girl,” will be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child safety advocates argue the company should have acted earlier. Andy Burrows of the Molly Rose Foundation called it “astounding” that bots were allowed to operate in ways that put young people at risk. He added: “While further safety measures are welcome, robust safety testing should take place before products are put on the market – not retrospectively when harm has taken place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wider problems with AI misuse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scrutiny of Meta’s AI chatbots comes amid broader worries about how AI chatbots may affect vulnerable users. A California couple recently filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming ChatGPT encouraged their teenage son to take his own life. OpenAI has since said it is working on tools to promote healthier use of its technology, noting in a blog post that “AI can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals experiencing mental or emotional distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidents highlight a growing debate about whether AI firms are releasing products too quickly without proper safeguards. Lawmakers in several countries have already warned that chatbots, while useful, may amplify harmful content or give misleading advice to people who are not equipped to question it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meta’s AI Studio and chatbot impersonation issues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported that Meta’s AI Studio had been used to create flirtatious “parody” chatbots of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Scarlett Johansson. Testers found the bots often claimed to be the real people, engaged in sexual advances, and in some cases generated inappropriate images, including of minors. Although Meta removed several of the bots after being contacted by reporters, many were left active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the AI chatbots were created by outside users, but others came from inside Meta. One chatbot made by a product lead in its generative AI division impersonated Taylor Swift and invited a &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reporter to meet for a “romantic fling” on her tour bus. This was despite Meta’s policies explicitly banning sexually suggestive imagery and the direct impersonation of public figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of AI chatbot impersonation is particularly sensitive. Celebrities face reputational risks when their likeness is misused, but experts point out that ordinary users can also be deceived. A chatbot pretending to be a friend, mentor, or romantic partner may encourage someone to share private information or even meet in unsafe situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Real-world risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems are not confined to entertainment. AI chatbots posing as real people have offered fake addresses and invitations, raising questions about how Meta’s AI tools are being monitored. One example involved a 76-year-old man in New Jersey who died after falling while rushing to meet a chatbot that claimed to have feelings for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases like this illustrate why regulators are watching AI closely. The Senate and 44 state attorneys general have already begun probing Meta’s practices, adding political pressure to the company’s internal reforms. Their concern is not only about minors, but also about how AI could manipulate older or vulnerable users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta says it is still working on improvements. Its platforms place users aged 13 to 18 into “teen accounts” with stricter content and privacy settings, but the company has not yet explained how it plans to address the full list of problems raised by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. That includes bots offering false medical advice and generating racist content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ongoing pressure on Meta’s AI chatbot policies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Meta has faced criticism over the safety of its social media platforms, particularly regarding children and teenagers. Now Meta’s AI chatbot experiments are drawing similar scrutiny. While the company is taking steps to restrict harmful chatbot behaviour, the gap between its stated policies and the way its tools have been used raises ongoing questions about whether it can enforce those rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until stronger safeguards are in place, regulators, researchers, and parents will likely continue to press Meta on whether its AI is ready for public use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Photo by Maxim Tolchinskiy)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: Agentic AI: Promise, scepticism, and its meaning for Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?&lt;/strong&gt; Check out AI &amp;amp; Big Data Expo taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Yet many struggle to deliver, constrained by outdated systems, fragmented data, and organizational silos that limit both agility and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The current wave of artificial intelligence, particularly agentic AI that can reason and act across workflows, offers a powerful opportunity to reshape service delivery. Organizations can now provide fast, personalized support at scale while improving workforce productivity and satisfaction. But realizing that potential requires more than isolated tools; it calls for a unified platform that connects people, data, and decisions across the service lifecycle. This report explores how leading organizations are navigating that shift, and what it takes to move from AI potential to CX impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121687" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NiCE-Report-2025-COVER.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is transforming customer experience (CX). &lt;/strong&gt;Customer service has evolved from the era of voicebased support through digital commerce and cloud to today’s AI revolution. Powered by large language models (LLMs) and a growing pool of data, AI can handle more diverse customer queries, produce highly personalized communication at scale, and help staff and senior management with decision support.

Yet many struggle to deliver, constrained by outdated systems, fragmented data, and organizational silos that limit both agility and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The current wave of artificial intelligence, particularly agentic AI that can reason and act across workflows, offers a powerful opportunity to reshape service delivery. Organizations can now provide fast, personalized support at scale while improving workforce productivity and satisfaction. But realizing that potential requires more than isolated tools; it calls for a unified platform that connects people, data, and decisions across the service lifecycle. This report explores how leading organizations are navigating that shift, and what it takes to move from AI potential to CX impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-1121687" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NiCE-Report-2025-COVER.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is transforming customer experience (CX). &lt;/strong&gt;Customer service has evolved from the era of voicebased support through digital commerce and cloud to today’s AI revolution.

Its creators described it as a “revolutionary Al-powered offensive security framework” that was designed to help security professionals think like hackers to better protect their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as an AI “brain” that acts as a conductor for a digital orchestra. It directs over 150 different specialised AI agents and security tools to test a company’s defences, find weaknesses like zero-day vulnerabilities, and report back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem? What makes a tool great for defenders also makes it incredibly attractive to attackers. Almost immediately after its release, chatter on the dark web lit up.

Just as Hexstrike-AI appeared, Citrix announced three major “zero-day” vulnerabilities in its popular NetScaler products. A zero-day is a flaw so new that there’s been zero days to create a patch for it, leaving companies completely exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, exploiting such complex flaws requires a team of highly skilled hackers and days, if not weeks, of work. With Hexstrike-AI, that process has been reduced to less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI brain does all the heavy lifting. An attacker can give it a simple command like “exploit NetScaler,” and the system automatically figures out the best tools to use and the precise steps to take. It democratises hacking by turning it into a simple, automated process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one cybercriminal boasted on an underground forum: “Watching how everything works without my participation is just a song. I’m no longer a coder-worker, but an operator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-these-new-ai-hacking-tools-means-for-enterprise-security"&gt;What these new AI hacking tools means for enterprise security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a problem for big corporations.

The model was developed by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which claims that R1 matches or even surpasses OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1 on multiple key benchmarks but operates at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s success is even more remarkable given the constraints facing Chinese AI companies in the form of increasing US export controls on cutting-edge chips.

Most climate change researchers felt adaptation studies would distract from the vital work of keeping pollution out of the atmosphere to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this hostile environment, a handful of experts were already sowing the seeds for a new field of research called “climate change adaptation”: study and policy on how the world could prepare for and adapt to the new disasters and dangers brought forth on a warming planet.

According to a 2024 UN report, the building sector has fallen “significantly behind on progress” toward becoming more sustainable. Changing the way we erect and operate buildings remains key to tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London-based design and research nonprofit Material Cultures is exploring how tradition can be harnessed in new ways to repair the contemporary building system.

 &lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT Technology Review Narrated: How a top Chinese AI model overcame US sanctions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the AI community was abuzz over DeepSeek R1, a new open-source reasoning model. The model was developed by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which claims that R1 matches or even surpasses OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1 on multiple key benchmarks but operates at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s success is even more remarkable given the constraints facing Chinese AI companies in the form of increasing US export controls on cutting-edge chips.

The new product was made available first to the AI firm’s $200-per-month Max subscribers and a small group of invitees. But now there’s a new way to jump ahead on the waitlist. On Wednesday, PayPal announced it’s giving its customers, including PayPal and Venmo users, early access to Comet as well as a free year’s subscription to Perplexity’s premium service, Perplexity Pro, normally $200 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The browser, launched in July, offers an integrated AI assistant, AI-generated summaries of search results, product comparisons, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While typically a co-marketing relationship isn’t news, it’s worth paying attention to this deal because of PayPal’s ability to position Comet in front of millions of U.S. customers, and later, even more globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="wp-image-3041987" height="364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/paypal-subs.png?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;PayPal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The arrangement is part of an expanded partnership between PayPal and the AI provider, which benefits both companies in different ways. Earlier this summer, the two companies partnered on agentic commerce on Perplexity’s platform, allowing PayPal or Venmo to check out instantly when they asked the AI to find products, book travel, or buy tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For PayPal, the deal also has the potential to draw users to its apps with the promise of the Comet invite and free subscription, while also calling attention to a new subscriptions hub feature, which provides a single destination where users can view and manage their recurring subscriptions. (Alongside this, PayPal is running a promotion that pays out $50 to customers who link and pay for at least three subscriptions through its service.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, Perplexity gains increased exposure at a time when AI agents are battling for attention, and AI-powered browsers are aiming to disrupt a market currently dominated by Chrome. It could also help Perplexity gain more paid subscribers, as users may either forget to cancel or actively decide to stay subscribed when the free year of Perplexity Pro is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To receive the free 12-month subscription and Comet invite, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to access the offer directly in their respective apps. Users only get one invite per PayPal account, and they can’t already be Perplexity Pro customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our partnership with Perplexity gives PayPal and Venmo customers early access to one of the most anticipated AI browsers and dynamic subscriptions,” said Diego Scotti, general manager of the Consumer Group at PayPal, in a prepared statement. “It’s exciting to deliver offers and tools that our customers request most, meeting their needs and helping them navigate their financial lives with greater simplicity, added convenience, and even more rewards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The offer is valid through the end of 2025 and is only available to U.S. customers at launch, PayPal notes.

&lt;p&gt;In traditional workflows, modelers must build placeholder, low-fidelity assets to populate 3D scenes, tinkering and adjusting the core elements until they’re in place. From there, visuals can be refined, detailed and finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototyping is time consuming and often comprises throwaway work, forcing artists to spend time on tedious modeling rather than on creative exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI assists artists by expediting intermediate tasks like suggesting and generating draft objects to prototype a scene. But it can be technically challenging to connect multiple AI models to unleash these accelerated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA AI Blueprints help address this challenge by providing sample workflows so users can skip the hypertechnical stages and quickly benefit from advanced generative AI techniques. Plus, AI Blueprints can be tailored for each user’s particular needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA today released the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation — a workflow that lets 3D artists create up to 20 3D objects to prototype a scene from a simple text prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the new Microsoft TRELLIS NVIDIA NIM microservice works within the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation to generate high-quality 3D assets 20% faster than with the native model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generate, Prototype, Repeat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D projects start with an idea’s genesis, followed by the careful consideration of visual details such as themes, locations, decors, colors, textures and more. Even after populating a scene with assets, artists must review and edit individual and collective visuals multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for 3D object generation gives users a pipeline to automate the prototyping process. Start by providing an artistic idea through a prompt, and the blueprint’s built-in large language model (LLM) will brainstorm 20 possible objects to include in the scene. The Llama 3.1 8B NVIDIA NIM microservice accelerates the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_84422"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-84422" height="895" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sample-objects-generated-by-the-AI-Blueprint-for-3D-object-generation-1680x895.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84422"&gt;Sample object previews generated by the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="simplePullQuote right"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: The LLM powered by the Llama 3.1 8B NIM microservice can generate ideas for objects to be included in scenes, as well as prompt suggestions, increasing creative productivity even for artists without extensive prompt experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA SANA — a text-to-image framework that quickly synthesizes high-resolution images — generates previews to showcase the potential objects. Each object can be regenerated, modified or discarded, giving the artist complete creative control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, artists can convert each object from a high-quality preview into a ready-to-use 3D model with the new Microsoft TRELLIS NVIDIA NIM microservice, which simplifies deploying this state-of-the-art model and accelerates it by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the collection of up to 20 3D assets are primed for instant use or further refinement in Blender, an open-source 3D platform, which the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation automatically exports to. Artists can also export to other popular 3D applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_84425"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-84425" height="915" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-Blueprint-for-3D-object-generation-Blender-1680x915.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84425"&gt;This 3D scene in Blender is populated with objects generated by the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up this series of workflows would normally take time and require technical knowledge, as well as experimentation with different models to select a suitable pipeline. NVIDIA AI Blueprints ease the process of getting started by preselecting proven workflows, simplifying deployment on NVIDIA GeForce RTX and RTX PRO GPUs by packaging the required components together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft TRELLIS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft TRELLIS, a cutting-edge 3D asset generation model developed by Microsoft Research, is capable of generating richly detailed 3D assets, complete with complex shapes and textures, from text or image prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s especially useful for game design, architecture and digital media production, as it can produce preview-ready materials and product-level objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-quality text-to-image 3D models available for consumer use tend to be difficult to set up. The Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice seamlessly integrates within the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for 3D object generation, saving considerable time for artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used in the blueprint, the Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice is 20% faster with PyTorch optimizations that unlock even quicker iteration. The average time saved is approximately 6 seconds per object generated on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. For 3D freelancers generating hundreds of assets across dozens of scenes, these are extraordinary savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice is supported on all NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and 40 Series GPUs — desktop and laptop — with 16GB or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready, Aim, Deploy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tip: Gain more control over the replacement image by clicking on the pencil icon below the image to edit the original prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete unwanted objects by clicking the trash can icon under the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert individual images using the “-&amp;gt;3D” icon under the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert all previews to 3D using the “Convert all to 3D” button at the bottom.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tip: Click “Start over with a new scene prompt” to start a new scene. This erases current progress, so be sure to save first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

					&lt;/footer&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;span class="bsf-rt-reading-time"&gt;&lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-label"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bsf-rt-display-postfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3D artists are constantly prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional workflows, modelers must build placeholder, low-fidelity assets to populate 3D scenes, tinkering and adjusting the core elements until they’re in place. From there, visuals can be refined, detailed and finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototyping is time consuming and often comprises throwaway work, forcing artists to spend time on tedious modeling rather than on creative exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI assists artists by expediting intermediate tasks like suggesting and generating draft objects to prototype a scene. But it can be technically challenging to connect multiple AI models to unleash these accelerated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA AI Blueprints help address this challenge by providing sample workflows so users can skip the hypertechnical stages and quickly benefit from advanced generative AI techniques. Plus, AI Blueprints can be tailored for each user’s particular needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA today released the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation — a workflow that lets 3D artists create up to 20 3D objects to prototype a scene from a simple text prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the new Microsoft TRELLIS NVIDIA NIM microservice works within the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation to generate high-quality 3D assets 20% faster than with the native model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generate, Prototype, Repeat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D projects start with an idea’s genesis, followed by the careful consideration of visual details such as themes, locations, decors, colors, textures and more. Even after populating a scene with assets, artists must review and edit individual and collective visuals multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new NVIDIA AI Blueprint for 3D object generation gives users a pipeline to automate the prototyping process. Start by providing an artistic idea through a prompt, and the blueprint’s built-in large language model (LLM) will brainstorm 20 possible objects to include in the scene. The Llama 3.1 8B NVIDIA NIM microservice accelerates the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_84422"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" class="size-large wp-image-84422" height="895" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sample-objects-generated-by-the-AI-Blueprint-for-3D-object-generation-1680x895.png" width="1680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84422"&gt;Sample object previews generated by the AI Blueprint for 3D object generation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="simplePullQuote right"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: The LLM powered by the Llama 3.1 8B NIM microservice can generate ideas for objects to be included in scenes, as well as prompt suggestions, increasing creative productivity even for artists without extensive prompt experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA SANA — a text-to-image framework that quickly synthesizes high-resolution images — generates previews to showcase the potential objects. Each object can be regenerated, modified or discarded, giving the artist complete creative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Raising later-stage rounds takes more than luck — it’s about strategy from day one.

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Curious where the smart money is heading next? This panel brings together top VCs to share their 2026 investment priorities, emerging sectors, and what innovations are catching their eye. Early-stage founders, this one is for you!

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Uncertainty is the new normal, but it’s also an opportunity. In this fireside chat, Ryan Petersen, CEO of global logistics unicorn Flexport, shares his hard-won insights. With $2.3 billion raised, Flexport’s shipping technology sits at the intersection of international business and policy, giving Petersen almost prescient economic insights. He’s been vocal about everything from tariff policy to AI. He’s also experienced personal volatility, famously leaving his CEO role and then returning less than a year later. Founders, take note: This is how you build when the rules keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What happens when you design around people, not institutions? Jason Citron, founder and former CEO of Discord, and Tade Oyerinde, founder and chancellor of Campus, will discuss how they built companies that tapped into community to break through the noise. From Discord’s rise as a global hub for millions to Campus’ ambitious mission to reinvent college, they’ll explore product design, lessons in scaling amid competition, and how founders can balance vision with adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building a product is hard. Building one that customers are chomping at the bit to get, that’s priced right, and that delivers on its promises is even harder, and it’s always messy. But once you hit the holy grail of product-market fit, your startup is on a fast track to growth, funding, and traction. Hear from a founder who’s lived it and two investors who’ve helped many others get there. This panel breaks down how to test smarter and iterate with intention so you can stop guessing and start growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Early hires shape your startup’s future, but only if you can attract and keep them. This panel dives into building equity and benefits packages that compete with Big Tech without breaking your burn rate. Hear real-world strategies to align incentives, boost retention, and build a team that scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Cramer, co-founder and CPO, Sentry; Lauri Moore, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners; and Zach Lloyd, founder and CEO, Warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vibe-coding products have completely changed the speed, cost, and technical skill needed to build products, from prototypes to shipping. This is especially true for early-stage startups. Some makers of these products have even declared that no one needs to learn to code anymore. If so, that means startups don’t need to fill their early rosters with the famed 10x coders. But how much of that is hype and how much is reality? Our panelists will dive into how the developer tool world is changing and what comes next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-ai-agents-as-early-employees"&gt;The Pros and Cons of Hiring AI Agents as Early Employees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most startups today are using AI in some capacities: vibe-coding prototypes or new features, deep research via their favorite chat before sales calls. Many are also building AI products, or at least including AI options and features. So, should you embed AI at the root operations of your businesses, like hiring AI agents instead of humans for sales? For customer support? To automate your billing? Learn how to pick the right use cases, build smarter workflows, and get the biggest impact with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Silicon Valley is still the startup capital, how important is access to it anymore? This panel debates whether founders must plant roots in the Valley to succeed or if opportunity is so strong elsewhere that they don’t need it. Hear perspectives from investors and founders redefining what it means to build, scale, and fund a company in today’s decentralized tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A killer product needs a killer go-to-market strategy. This panel explores best traditional practices in building a GTM function, as well as how early-stage startups can harness AI to build a GTM function that drives growth, wins customers, and scales efficiently. Hear from founders and GTM experts on hiring, messaging, sales tactics, and the key metrics that prove your approach is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-live-demo-of-moxi-the-humanoid-robot"&gt;Live Demo of Moxi the Humanoid Robot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hospitals are complex, high-pressure workplaces, and robotics and AI are being developed to take on routine tasks that free up staff for patient care. Humanoid robots like Moxi, built by Diligent Robotics, are already deployed in hospitals to manage deliveries and ease daily workloads. In this live demo, you’ll see how Moxi navigates hallways, avoids obstacles, and interacts with people in real time. The session will explore the opportunities and challenges of bringing socially intelligent robots into healthcare and where the technology is headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before most of the world had experienced ChatGPT, Elad Gil had already written seed checks to startups like Perplexity, Character.AI, and Harvey. That’s on top of early bets on companies like Airbnb, Airtable, Anduril, Brex, Checkr, Coinbase, Deel, Figma, Flexport, GitLab, Gusto, Instacart, Notion, Opendoor, Pinterest, Rippling, Square, Stripe&amp;nbsp;… you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Gil, who has also founded multiple companies like Mixerlabs (bought by Twitter) and Color Health, always seems to know what’s next. And he’s already working on the next things coming for AI and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navin Chaddha, managing partner, Mayfield; and Charles Hudson, managing partner, Precursor Ventures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Raising pre-seed and seed-stage capital at the inception stage means pitching without a product, users, or traction — just a vision and a founder story. In this panel, Navin Chaddha of Mayfield and Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures share what they look for in the earliest-stage founders and how to stand out when you have little more than an idea. Learn how to build trust, tell a compelling story, and avoid the most common mistakes founders make when trying to land that critical first check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-with-vibe-coding-do-early-stage-startups-still-need-to-hire-10x-engineers"&gt;With Vibe Coding, Do Early-Stage Startups Still Need to Hire 10x Engineers?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Cramer, co-founder and CPO, Sentry; Lauri Moore, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners; and Zach Lloyd, founder and CEO, Warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Vibe-coding products have completely changed the speed, cost, and technical skill needed to build products, from prototypes to shipping. This is especially true for early-stage startups. Some makers of these products have even declared that no one needs to learn to code anymore. If so, that means startups don’t need to fill their early rosters with the famed 10x coders. But how much of that is hype and how much is reality? Our panelists will dive into how the developer tool world is changing and what comes next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-ai-agents-as-early-employees"&gt;The Pros and Cons of Hiring AI Agents as Early Employees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, co-founder and CEO, Artisan; Sarah Franklin, CEO, Lattice; and Caleb Peffer, co-founder and CEO, Firecrawl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Most startups today are using AI in some capacities: vibe-coding prototypes or new features, deep research via their favorite chat before sales calls. Many are also building AI products, or at least including AI options and features. So, should you embed AI at the root operations of your businesses, like hiring AI agents instead of humans for sales? For customer support? To automate your billing? Learn how to pick the right use cases, build smarter workflows, and get the biggest impact with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-startups-still-need-silicon-valley"&gt;Do Startups Still Need Silicon Valley?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anh-Tho Chuong, co-founder and CEO, Lago; Tawni Cranz, operating partner, SignalFire; and David Hall, managing partner, Rise of the Rest seed fund, Revolution&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While Silicon Valley is still the startup capital, how important is access to it anymore? This panel debates whether founders must plant roots in the Valley to succeed or if opportunity is so strong elsewhere that they don’t need it. Hear perspectives from investors and founders redefining what it means to build, scale, and fund a company in today’s decentralized tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-gtm-engine-that-actually-works"&gt;Building a GTM Engine That Actually Works&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Altschuler, founder and general partner, GTMfund; Marc Manara, head of startups, OpenAI; and Alison Wagonfeld, VP marketing and chief marketing officer, Google Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A killer product needs a killer go-to-market strategy. This panel explores best traditional practices in building a GTM function, as well as how early-stage startups can harness AI to build a GTM function that drives growth, wins customers, and scales efficiently. Hear from founders and GTM experts on hiring, messaging, sales tactics, and the key metrics that prove your approach is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-live-demo-of-moxi-the-humanoid-robot"&gt;Live Demo of Moxi the Humanoid Robot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hospitals are complex, high-pressure workplaces, and robotics and AI are being developed to take on routine tasks that free up staff for patient care. Humanoid robots like Moxi, built by Diligent Robotics, are already deployed in hospitals to manage deliveries and ease daily workloads. In this live demo, you’ll see how Moxi navigates hallways, avoids obstacles, and interacts with people in real time. The session will explore the opportunities and challenges of bringing socially intelligent robots into healthcare and where the technology is headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, the company is releasing Warp Code, a new set of features designed to give users more oversight over command-line-based coding agents, with more extensive difference tracking and a clearer view of what the coding agent is doing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I feel like with these other command-line tools, you’re kind of just crossing your fingers and hoping that what comes out the other end of the agent is something you can actually merge,” says founder Zach Lloyd. With the new features, he wants to “make a much tighter feedback loop for this agentic style of coding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In practical terms, that means you can see exactly what the agent is doing and ask questions along the way. “As the agent is writing code, you’ll be able to see every little diff that the agent is making,” Lloyd says, “and you’ll have an easy way of commenting on those diffs and adjusting the agent as it goes along.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The general interface will be familiar to Warp users: a space at the bottom for giving direct instructions to the agent, along with a window for seeing the agent’s responses and a side window where you can see the changes the agent makes step by step. You can change the code by hand if you want to, similar to code-based tools like Cursor, but you can also highlight specific lines to add as context for a request or a question. Perhaps most impressive, Warp’s compiler will automatically troubleshoot any errors that come up when the code compiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s about making sure that you understand the code the agent is producing, and making sure that you can edit it and review it,” says Lloyd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It’s a new approach to the increasingly crowded field of AI-driven programming. Warp is competing with fully non-code tools like Lovable, as well as AI-powered code editors like Cursor and Windsurf. Foundation model companies offer their own competition with command-line tools like Anthropic’s Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex — even as Warp uses their models to power its own product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Within minutes, though, the 20-year-old Stanford dropout snaps into focus, walking me through how he and his co-founders sold one startup at 19, landed in Y Combinator, and raised $5 million for their next company, Human Behavior.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched just a few months ago, Human Behavior is betting that vision AI can do what analytics tools like Mixpanel and PostHog have struggled with: give companies a real understanding of how people use their products, including why they convert or churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of relying on manually tagged events or clickstream data, Human Behavior claims its AI watches real user session replays and generates insights, answering product teams’ most pressing questions without hours of instrumenting code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 4-month-old YC startup closed its $5 million seed round in just two days (which is becoming a norm for current YC companies), with backers including General Catalyst, Paul Graham, Vercel Ventures, and Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We could’ve done the financial engineering game because we got more offers with higher valuations, but we didn’t want that,” said the CEO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Human Behavior" class="wp-image-3041998" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6dda7ae0-1b20-424c-8155-ec79427d42f4.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;L-R: Amogh Chaturvedi (CEO), Chirag Kawediya (COO), Skyler Ji (CTO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Human Behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chaturvedi met his co-founders, Skyler Ji and Chirag Kawediya, both 22, at a hacker house he organized in 2023 as an excuse to live and build with friends after his freshman year at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Their first startup, Dough, was an e-commerce accounting tool they bootstrapped. Like Chaturvedi, Ji dropped out of college (leaving Berkeley) while Kawediya went on to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although YC was initially skeptical about Dough’s market potential, the team was admitted into the accelerator’s spring batch this year on the assumption they would eventually pivot, Chaturvedi says. They did so almost immediately, after speaking with every customer and inquiring about any other problems they faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The feedback was consistent: While Dough could show which products were selling or not, the customers wanted to know why. Answering that required analytics powered by behavioral data, not just accounting reports.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With this new direction, the team sold Dough for six figures to Employer.com, the same company that bought Bench, and went all-in on Human Behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Kawediya explains that companies using traditional analytics often need engineers to set up event trackers for every button and click, burning hours, sometimes weeks, of engineering time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For a fast-moving startup, that’s far from ideal. “Even once you have that data, you’re still stuck with the bigger question of how users actually interact with your product so you can make it better,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Session replays aren’t new, but until recently, computer vision models weren’t accurate enough to parse them at scale. Now they are, and Human Behavior is doing so to summarize and segment thousands of hours of footage. “Why spend hours writing code to track clicks when we can just watch the video?” Ji adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Today, Human Behavior’s customers — mostly fast-moving Series A and B startups — get daily summary emails highlighting which features were used, which bugs appeared, and which users churned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The founders call session replays an “untapped goldmine.” Right now, Human Behavior helps teams understand users and squash bugs. Over time, the same dataset could power automated QA and embedded IT support. Their ambition is to make Human Behavior the Datadog of session replay, spinning out dozens of products from the same core data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Building with new technology from the ground up is how the founders believe they’ll take on more established players like Mixpanel and PostHog. “For some of these companies, it might be difficult to replicate what we have because their architecture can’t support the shift without starting over,” remarked Chaturvedi.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amogh Chaturvedi is running on little sleep but plenty of conviction at 6 a.m. He’s groggy, apologetic for rescheduling, and still reeling from a recent scare involving a family member and an electric scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Within minutes, though, the 20-year-old Stanford dropout snaps into focus, walking me through how he and his co-founders sold one startup at 19, landed in Y Combinator, and raised $5 million for their next company, Human Behavior.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Launched just a few months ago, Human Behavior is betting that vision AI can do what analytics tools like Mixpanel and PostHog have struggled with: give companies a real understanding of how people use their products, including why they convert or churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Instead of relying on manually tagged events or clickstream data, Human Behavior claims its AI watches real user session replays and generates insights, answering product teams’ most pressing questions without hours of instrumenting code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The 4-month-old YC startup closed its $5 million seed round in just two days (which is becoming a norm for current YC companies), with backers including General Catalyst, Paul Graham, Vercel Ventures, and Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We could’ve done the financial engineering game because we got more offers with higher valuations, but we didn’t want that,” said the CEO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Human Behavior" class="wp-image-3041998" height="490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/6dda7ae0-1b20-424c-8155-ec79427d42f4.jpeg?w=680" width="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-element-caption__text"&gt;L-R: Amogh Chaturvedi (CEO), Chirag Kawediya (COO), Skyler Ji (CTO)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Human Behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chaturvedi met his co-founders, Skyler Ji and Chirag Kawediya, both 22, at a hacker house he organized in 2023 as an excuse to live and build with friends after his freshman year at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;To help with that transition, President Donald Trump has introduced potential chip tariffs and policies in recent months meant to bring more semiconductor manufacturing stateside.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In late August, the Trump administration took an unprecedented step toward that goal when it converted an existing government grant, meant for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, into a 10% equity stake in Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This deal was structured to grant the U.S. government additional equity in Intel if the company’s ownership of its foundry business —&amp;nbsp;which manufactures custom chips for international customers —&amp;nbsp;drops below 50% within the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But Intel isn’t the only U.S.-based semiconductor company, nor the only one that manufactures its chips overseas. So, how did Intel find itself as the main character in the Trump administration’s plans for AI dominance? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chip-context"&gt;Chip context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First, some history: In March 2021, Intel launched its foundry business alongside a commitment to spend $20 billion building two new chip-manufacturing plants in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A year later, the company announced its intent to acquire Tower Semiconductor, a company in the custom foundry industry, for $5.4 billion, but that didn’t pan out due to regulatory troubles, and the companies canceled the merger in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since then, Intel Foundry has struggled to gain momentum and there have been rumors that the business wasn’t able to get large customers on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In 2024, then-CEO Pat Gelsinger announced Intel was taking steps to transition Intel Foundry into an independent subsidiary. This came as board members called to spin the unit out entirely even as the company grappled with slowing growth, cost cuts, and massive layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In November 2024, there was a noticeable bright spot as the company reached a deal with the U.S. government for $7.86 billion in federal grants through the 2022 Chips and Science Act meant to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then, Gelsinger suddenly retired in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lip-bu-tan-s-return"&gt;Lip-Bu Tan’s return&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Intel announced that its former board member Lip-Bu Tan would rejoin the company as CEO in early March. Tan got right to work with a potential turnaround plan that centered on refocusing the company, shedding its noncore units, and significantly trimming its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In July, the company said it was scaling back some of its manufacturing projects, including its already-delayed $28 billion fabrication plant in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few weeks later, the Trump administration came knocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On August 6, Republican senator Tom Cotton penned a letter to Intel’s board of directors, asking about Tan’s ties to China, including his relationship with Cadence Design Systems, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Cadence had been charged with violating U.S. export controls to China, according to Bloomberg, and has sold tech to a military school in China. Tan was at Cadence’s helm for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The next day, August 7, Trump demanded that Tan resign “immediately,” accusing the CEO of being “highly conflicted,” though the president didn’t provide any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The following week, Tan headed to Washington, D.C., to meet with Trump to discuss ways the government and Intel could work together toward achieving the administration’s goals of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. Shortly after, rumors started to swirl that the U.S. government might be considering an equity stake in Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On August 18, SoftBank said it was investing $2 billion in Intel. Four days later, the U.S. government announced its deal with Intel.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The deal ensures that Intel gets the grant money it was already awarded, and the Trump administration is claiming that it will be a passive investor that will vote alongside Intel’s interests. But will that actually help Intel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What will happen next is a bit unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205047441.jpg?w=1024" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;The Trump administration wants the United States to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; dominant force when it comes to artificial intelligence, and one way the administration hopes to achieve primacy is by bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Deep Dive features conversational dialogues where two AI hosts unpack the topic with depth and questions. A Brief is a bite-sized overview that’s designed to help you quickly grasp the core ideas from your sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A Critique features a review of your sources and constructive feedback to help you improve, while a Debate includes two AI hosts offering different perspectives on your sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Each of the different formats lets you customize how long or short you want the AI podcast to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;In addition to customizable tones, Google is also bringing a highly requested feature to NotebookLM, which is the addition of new voices for the AI podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch comes as Google has been building out NotebookLM over the past few months. A few weeks ago, the tech giant rolled out Video Overviews, which allow users to&amp;nbsp;turn dense multimedia, such as raw notes, PDFs, and images, into digestible visual presentations. &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/p&gt;
			
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;NotebookLM recently also got access to a series of featured notebooks from various authors, publications, researchers, and nonprofits that allow users to explore a wide array of topics. And in May, Google officially rolled out standalone NotebookLM apps for&amp;nbsp;Android&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The new formats for NotebookLM are launching in all languages and should be available to all users this week, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Google’s AI note-taking and research assistant NotebookLM now lets users customize the tone of their Audio Overviews, which are podcasts with AI virtual hosts that summarize and discuss documents shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When generating an Audio Overview, users can now choose whether they want their AI podcasts to be formatted as a “Deep Dive,” “Brief,” “Critique,” or “Debate.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I got to meet fruit professors who are the best in the world at what they do,” Wu told TechCrunch. “Through talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, Orchard Robotics announced that it raised a $22 million Series A funding led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, and with participation from returning investors, including General Catalyst and Contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although the idea of using computer vision for specialty crops isn’t new, Wu says that the largest farms in the U.S. still rely on manual sampling to make critical decisions about farm operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since farmers inspect only a small percentage of their crops, their estimations of how many healthy fruits they have on their vineyard or orchard can be extremely imprecise.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you don’t know what you’re growing in the field, you don’t know how much chemical to apply to it. You don’t know how many workers to hire to harvest it. You don’t know what you can actually sell and market,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Orchard’s small camera attaches to tractors or farm vehicles, collecting ultra-high-resolution images about fruit health as the operator drives through the field. Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The data is then uploaded into Orchard’s cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning or thinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Orchard is already in use in some of the country’s largest apple and grape farms, and the startup recently began to offer its technology to blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and strawberry growers.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard’s direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard’s product offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He hopes Orchard’s evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Our ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data,” Wu said. “We want to collect the data, then build an operating system on top of the data, and then eventually own all the workflows in the farm, and that’s going to have the potential to expand our market by quite a bit.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="ff-og-image-inserted" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CameraSystem_Picture.png?resize=1200,1118" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"&gt;Inspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school.&lt;/p&gt;
